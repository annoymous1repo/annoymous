It’s tough to know that things will probably get worse before they get better and this may take some time.

I also worry about my family and friends who are all quite a long way away from me, and there is a sense of powerlessness that I feel sometimes. This is all quite negative but on the flip side there is opportunity in this in that I can try and work on self development and to put things into perspective and to realise that the fast paced lifestyle that we all lead is actually not the best way to live and in the future once we get through this hopefully people will put things into some sort of perspective and realise that there are more important things in life. It’s also interesting to see how nature is taking a big breather from the impact we as humans have on the world and if there are no flights, factories shut, and less people consuming energy without reason then there could be a positive impact on nature and global warming, which at least would be a good by product from this uncertain and depressing times. Hopefully this will end and people will get used to the new normality but we can be more positive and open to each other and pool together globally for the better. The other scary side product of this is the impact on the financial world, and I think that this may be further reaching and be quite tough.

In my opinion there should be a lockdown style approach until everyone is vaccinated even if it takes a couple of years. Wellbeing may be affected but we are in a PANDEMIC so sacrifices for the long run need to be made. Going in and out of lockdowns with mass deaths and cases per time isn't doing any good. Problem with the UK is compliance, government don't know how to enforce as public have zero respect. \nSince the beginning and even now I was/disinfect products from shops, limit my outings to places like the shops (deliveries instead), have not seen friends and family properly in over a year, take my son to outdoor parks/public areas, my son doesn't get to play after school with anyone.. we do everything more than by the book to stay safe as son has asthma and I'm a smoker so our lungs not the best.
