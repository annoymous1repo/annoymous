Once home, following medical advice, he could not eat meat for three months and had to stick to a light diet. However, he successfully quit his long-standing smoking habit during this time. After nearly a month of recuperation, his physical condition has improved from feeling dizzy even when walking quickly right after discharge to currently having no major issues. By all accounts, everything is developing positively.", "But one day, things suddenly changed. In fact, when I was just discharged from the hospital, I still felt a lot of discomfort. The doctor had warned me in advance, and I could accept it, after all, I was just recovering from a serious illness and needed to take things slowly. Therefore, many minor symptoms might have been overlooked in the face of more significant issues. However, as my body gradually recovered, my strength slowly improved. Some minor symptoms that I hadn’t paid attention to before suddenly started to trouble me a lot.", "At first, I constantly felt discomfort in my nasopharynx, as if there was something foreign, and I couldn't stop thinking about it. The more I thought, the more uncomfortable I felt. I always felt my ears were clogged after swallowing saliva, and there was saliva in my throat that I couldn't swallow completely, which I would cough up, only for it to return shortly after. One day, I accidentally blew out bloody mucus from my nose, and I quickly searched online. Comparing my symptoms, I found that it could possibly be nasopharyngeal cancer, which scared me, so I hurried to the hospital to see a doctor. The doctor used a laryngoscope and found only slight congestion and rhinitis, stating that there was nothing serious, and prescribed some medication for me. However, after using the medication for a while, the symptoms seemed to persist. They only seemed to fade when I was suddenly distracted by other things, but as soon as my attention returned, the symptoms came back. Every day, regularly or upon waking up in the morning, I would try to swallow to see if there was any discomfort in my throat. Even now, as I write about these symptoms, that feeling of phlegm stuck in my throat has returned. So, I am almost certain that this feeling is caused by psychological reasons.", "One morning after having a bowel movement, I felt a bit like I had diarrhea and ended up going again. After that, I felt like I never fully emptied my bowels. From then on, every day after using the toilet, I paid special attention to my feelings, and it felt uncomfortable just like the previous time, always feeling the urge to go but unable to. I usually didn't dare to be far from the bathroom. I started searching on Baidu, trying to self-diagnose and find the cause of my symptoms, and eventually, I went to see a doctor. After the examination, the doctor said it was just a bit of internal hemorrhoids and nothing serious. However, deep down, I seemed to never fully trust the result, always doubting there could be other reasons; otherwise, why would the symptoms persist? There was one time when a colleague suddenly called me to attend a meeting, and during the discussion, that discomfort seemed to suddenly disappear. This made me realize: the symptoms seemed to be influenced by psychological factors, just like before.", "I have identified and summarized a few key issues:", "When the stomach feels uncomfortable, the uncomfortable feeling in the throat seems to disappear, and vice versa!", "When both are fine, one tends to deliberately evoke an uncomfortable memory or create some other symptom.

Seeing my family worry about me makes me even more eager to adjust my mindset to face my current symptoms, but the more anxious I am, the less I know how to make that adjustment.", "7. Currently, I can't seem to take much interest in anything. Once I settle down or feel bored, I deliberately start to think about the symptoms of my body and my negative mindset.", "Case Analysis: Anxiety arises when humans realize they cannot dominate themselves, and their perception and behavior are controlled by irrational forces. Therefore, we created science and religion to explain various phenomena, finding an explanation that allows us to control what we cannot understand. For example, when we find ourselves in an emotional low and cannot escape, we receive a diagnosis from a psychiatrist: you have anxiety disorder or depression. Although this is not happy news, it seems to provide a temporary sense of stability, and this result simultaneously points to a clear treatment direction, allowing one to see a glimmer of hope in the darkness. However, whether it is anxiety disorder, hypochondria, depression, insomnia, or obsessive-compulsive disorder, they are all psychological issues; they are neither physical diseases nor diseases of physiological organs. Their existence is entirely due to problems in your thinking, leading to a temporary imbalance in brain neurotransmitters. They cannot be resolved through simple persuasion from others or self-adjustment and encouragement. Although my clients attempt to change and overcome their issues through medication, exercise, and various methods, they are often not very successful and do not address the fundamental problems. This is because medication can only help effectively alleviate the physical symptoms caused by anxiety; it cannot solve the problems in thinking. So what to do? Ultimately, one must turn to psychotherapy. Psychotherapy can help clients explore the deeper root causes behind these anxieties. Additionally, the presence of another person in psychotherapy helps to heal the effects of past traumatic experiences, addressing negative relational patterns underlying the symptoms, such as interpersonal loneliness, feelings of alienation, lack of support, and inner strength, with effects that other forms of help do not possess.", "Consultation Effect: After the consultation began, he continuously talked about his physical ailments, and later mentioned \"hypochondria,\" saying that he felt he had a mental illness. I asked him how this psychological problem came about. He then revealed that he found out after getting married that he was not born to his biological parents but was adopted by his adoptive father, who had brought him from a ravine while working in a coal mine in Shanxi. As a child, he often felt a vague sense of unease and would cry endlessly. He frequently dreamed of being lost in a big mountain and unable to find his parents, crying desperately. In these dreams, there seemed to be a man in a tattered green military coat holding him and a woman in ragged clothes calling out to him, but he could never see their faces. After getting married, his wife informed him about his origins, which was later confirmed by his adoptive parents. He always wanted to go back to Shanxi to search for his birthplace and biological parents, but both his adoptive parents and wife were unwilling, leading him to feel inexplicably irritated and angry, almost causing his wife to consider divorce. To help him reconnect with his biological parents, I conducted a guided imagery dialogue, allowing him to return to that mountain while under hypnosis, where he could vent the anger and resentment he had buried for years towards his biological parents. When the visitor opened his eyes after the session, he seemed like a different person; his wife said she hadn't seen him smile so happily in a long time. The visitor expressed that the heavy burden that had been hanging over his heart had finally been lifted!"], "experience_and_reflection": "From the visitor's narrative, this case represents a vivid example of \"hypochondria,\" a condition that, while often misunderstood, offers profound insights into the intricate interplay between mind and body. Hypochondria is characterized by persistent, intrusive thoughts regarding one's health, often accompanied by compulsive checking behaviors. These characteristics align it closely with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Through my work with this visitor, I've come to realize that addressing hypochondria requires a nuanced approach that transcends merely engaging with the surface-level symptoms. This reflection will explore the depth of insights gleaned from the case, underscoring the importance of exploring relational dynamics and the underlying emotional landscape.\n\nInitially, the visitor's narrative was dominated by an array of physical symptoms, ranging from nasopharyngeal discomfort to bowel irregularities. Each symptom was meticulously scrutinized, often leading to anxiety-driven online searches and frequent medical consultations. This pattern of behavior is indicative of a deeper psychological struggle where the individual seeks to assert control over an unpredictable and often overwhelming internal world. In hypochondria, the symptoms are not merely manifestations of anxiety; they are deeply symbolic, representing unresolved emotional conflicts and unmet psychological needs.\n\nReflecting on the therapeutic process, I recognized the necessity of shifting the focus from symptom management to exploring the visitor's relational world. This pivot was crucial in broadening the counseling perspective, ultimately allowing the visitor to uncover the connections between his hypochondria and his personal history. The realization that his persistent health concerns were less about actual physical ailments and more about unmet emotional needs was a pivotal moment in therapy.\n\nA significant turning point came when the visitor disclosed his adoption story—a narrative laden with feelings of abandonment, identity confusion, and a longing for connection. This revelation provided a critical insight into the roots of his hypochondria. The persistent health anxieties and compulsive behaviors can be seen as a symbolic representation of his unresolved search for identity and belonging. The visitor's discovery of his adoption after marriage, coupled with the resistance from his adoptive family to explore his origins, seemed to exacerbate these feelings, manifesting as health-related anxieties.\n\nThe therapeutic intervention that proved most transformative was the guided imagery dialogue, which facilitated an emotional reconciliation with his past. This technique allowed the visitor to engage with his subconscious mind, where many of these deep-seated fears and unresolved emotions resided. By symbolically returning to the place of his origins and expressing the suppressed anger and resentment towards his biological parents, the visitor was able to release the emotional burden he had carried for so long. The resultant emotional release was profound, as evidenced by the visitor's newfound sense of relief and the noticeable improvement in his demeanor post-session.\n\nMoreover, the visitor's hypochondria served as a defense mechanism, a way to divert attention from the painful reality of his identity struggles and relational disconnects. By focusing on his health, he could temporarily escape the emotional turmoil stemming from his adoption story and the relational tensions it created. However, this escape was only temporary, as evidenced by the cyclical nature of his symptoms. This insight underscores the importance of understanding hypochondria not as a mere set of irrational fears but as a complex psychological condition rooted in relational and emotional dynamics.\n\nAs the therapy progressed, it became increasingly evident that the visitor's hypochondria was intertwined with his interpersonal relationships, particularly with his wife and adoptive parents. His wife's disclosure of his adoption and the subsequent familial resistance to exploring his origins highlighted the relational strains that contributed to his anxiety. The visitor's sense of being trapped between his adoptive family's expectations and his own desire for self-discovery created a fertile ground for hypochondria to thrive. The therapy sessions focused on helping the visitor articulate these relational conflicts and explore potential pathways for resolution.\n\nThrough these explorations, the visitor gained a deeper understanding of how his health anxieties were closely linked to feelings of powerlessness in his relationships. The persistent checking behaviors and obsessive health concerns were, in essence, an attempt to regain a sense of control and agency in a relational context where he felt powerless. By helping the visitor establish healthier communication patterns and assert his needs within his relationships, the therapy aimed to reduce the emotional reliance on hypochondria as a coping mechanism.\n\nAdditionally, the visitor's journey highlighted the critical role of self-awareness in overcoming hypochondria. His acknowledgment of the psychological origins of his symptoms was a testament to the power of insight in facilitating change. While the visitor initially struggled with counter-suggestions and hypnosis, the therapeutic process gradually enabled him to develop a more compassionate and accepting relationship with himself. This shift in self-perception was crucial in reducing the intensity of his health anxieties and fostering a sense of inner peace.\n\nReflecting on this case, I am reminded of the importance of adopting a holistic approach to psychotherapy. Hypochondria, like many psychological conditions, cannot be fully understood or resolved through a narrow focus on symptoms alone. It requires an exploration of the individual's relational history, emotional landscape, and the symbolic meanings embedded in their anxieties. By embracing this broader perspective, therapists can facilitate deeper healing and empower individuals to reclaim their sense of agency and identity.\n\nIn conclusion, this case of hypochondria offered profound insights into the complexities of the human psyche. It underscored the importance of looking beyond symptoms to uncover the relational and emotional roots of psychological distress. Through therapeutic interventions that prioritize emotional exploration and relational healing, individuals can move towards a more integrated and fulfilling existence, free from the constraints of hypochondria. This journey of self-discovery and healing is a testament to the transformative power of psychotherapy and its capacity to illuminate the path towards wholeness and well-being.", "causes": "Traumatic experiences in personal growth (adoption) lead\nto emotional depression and unmet psychological needs", "symptoms": "Hypochondriasis, anxiety disorders", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection;\nListening & Empathy: Building Relationships;\nIntentional Orientation and Hypnosis: Venting Emotions", "characteristics_of_illness": "Psychological hypochondriasis and anxiety symptoms\ntriggered by physical illness", "treatment_effect": "Through the exploration of the past, the deep-seated\nreasons behind hypochondriasis are discovered, that is, the\npursuit of self-identity and a sense of belonging, which\nalleviates the anxiety and interpersonal sensitivity caused by\nusing hypochondriasis as a defense mechanism, and the long- suppressed emotions are vented and relieved, and the client\ncan face the problems and difficulties that he may encounter in life with a more peaceful, calm and objective attitude."}
{"id": 2, "case_description": ["One afternoon in the golden autumn, I received a call at the clinic regarding a case from Jiangsu, inquiring about hypnotherapy for insomnia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and social anxiety disorder. The caller reported that in the past 1-2 months, they had developed severe obsessive-compulsive symptoms, including both compulsive behaviors and compulsive thoughts. The compulsive behaviors involved secretly focusing on the genital areas of people around them, as well as the jewelry carried by girls. However, they were very afraid of being noticed, which caused embarrassment, leading to compulsive thoughts. They desperately tried to rid themselves of this obsessive focus and thinking, but the more they tried to escape it, the worse the obsession became, to the point that it caused fear in social interactions and resulted in insomnia. They even took sleep medication but continued to experience insomnia, needing to drink strong alcohol to numb their thoughts enough to fall asleep. This situation severely affected their normal work and life, and they believed it was triggered by focusing on their boyfriend's watch, making immediate treatment necessary. They had also attended a couple of psychological consultations, but found them ineffective.", "Due to the fact that the individual had read some books about psychological suggestion, she understood that only hypnotherapy could quickly and effectively resolve her psychological issues. She searched for hypnotherapy on Baidu and found our Dr. Cao's Hypnosis Center. The individual is a single woman in her 30s, a college graduate, who has had two short-lived failed relationships and works at a foreign company."], "consultation_process": ["After a simple phone consultation, I initially judged that the mental disorder might be caused by past physical and psychological issues. I informed them about the duration of hypnotherapy, the costs, and how to make an appointment. The client eagerly booked a session for the next day with Dr. Cao Zice, who would personally conduct the systematic hypnotherapy.", "At nine o'clock the next morning, the client arrived on time at Dr. Cao's Hypnosis Center in Yangpu District, Shanghai, for a systematic hypnotherapy session. When she arrived, she was wearing a large mask that covered her face, seemingly unwilling to draw attention from others. It appeared that she had reached an excessive level of concern for her personal privacy, which led me to believe that she might be hiding corresponding issues in her psyche, potentially offering a breakthrough point for the problem.", "Due to the fact that the individual had previously undergone psychological counseling without any effect, she initially remained skeptical about hypnosis therapy, believing that her sensitivity to hypnosis might not be strong enough and unsure if she could be hypnotized effectively. Given this concern, I first guided her through a full-body relaxation hypnosis experience and had her listen to the hypnosis of the \"Hypnosis Garden.\" When the individual woke up, she felt fully aware throughout the process. When I asked her about the content she had just listened to, she was unable to accurately and sequentially respond, which led her to surprisingly admit that she had indeed been well hypnotized. This was because, like many others, she mistakenly believed that once hypnotized, one would lose awareness and be controlled by the hypnotist! Through the relaxation experience of the Hypnosis Garden, I corrected her understanding of hypnosis: the hypnotic state is a state of awareness that is even clearer than the so-called waking state with eyes open, and the individual can completely be aware of and control her actions; all she needed to do was to subjectively cooperate with the hypnotist's suggestions.", "With this solid foundation, the subsequent hypnosis became easier and more profound. Sensitivity tests revealed that the individual's hypnosis sensitivity could reach level four on a six-level scale, indicating her sensitivity is above average. At this moment, I am about 80 to 90 percent confident in exploring hypnosis to treat her physical and mental issues.", "Considering her strong obsessive-compulsive tendencies, I decided to break from convention and use Dr. Cao's system of spiritual practice to conduct high-intensity treatment on her nervous system (brain, including psychological aspects). After perfectly coordinating the case and diligently completing this phase, she reported feeling very relaxed and calm inside, no longer experiencing obsession and fixation.", "A series of explorations and healing of the mind, body, and spirit through hypnosis was immediately conducted.", "The specific details are complicated and will not be elaborated on here; let’s highlight a few key points:", "The happiest memory is when she came home for the New Year after being admitted to university, spending joyful moments with many relatives and her parents while playing cards. Remembering the warm and harmonious scenes of the whole family together is the happiest moment in her heart. Therefore, she also wants to start a family and have her own happiness, but her relationships have always been unsuccessful. What is the reason?!", "The person she loves most in her heart is her father, but she didn't realize it during her childhood because her father worked away from home for many years for the family and came back often drinking, which led to conflicts and her dislike for him. However, her father passed away five years ago! Now looking back, she realizes that only her father truly cared for her and understood her the most.", "The person who suffered the most from the incident was her father. After returning home from work one day after the New Year, she found her father drunk. They had a dispute, and during their shoving, she hit her father's face. After the incident, her father couldn't let it go and got drunk for several days, feeling that a daughter hitting her father was unacceptable! A few days later, the case left home to go back to work. Her mother had suggested that she apologize to her father, but she still left. After a few more days, she was still unable to sort out her emotions and even called her mother, asking her to divorce her father. She suggested that after the divorce, they could leave everything behind and rent a place to live. Listening to her daughter's words, her mother temporarily went to stay at her uncle's house and no longer returned home. A few days later, her uncle called her father, saying that her mother wouldn't be coming back and that they had to get a divorce. Her father, surprisingly, couldn't come to terms with it and went to the third floor of their old house to hang himself! During hypnosis therapy, the case sobbed and pleaded repeatedly for her father in heaven to forgive her.", "In hypnotherapy, some answers have emerged: the case is burdened by the guilt of the original family, and her subconscious conscience cannot forgive herself. This is the reason for her insomnia and the ineffectiveness of medication, as well as the reason for her failed relationships. Under the influence of the original family, she must first accept the archetype of her father in order to accept her future boyfriend (husband). Similarly, the behavioral patterns of the original family will also be copied into the child's behavior. The father's incompetence in dealing with issues and alcoholism may be resented by the child, but when the child encounters insurmountable difficulties, they will adopt their parents' ways, which in this case means drinking to fall asleep. (This is true education, rather than merely learning culture and skills.)", "So how did her issue with compulsive gazes form? And what are the causes of social anxiety disorder?", "So continue to hypnotize and delve into the life experiences of the case.", "4. The first onset of obsessive scrutiny began after a recent breakup. In that relationship, the boyfriend was introduced by a relative, very wealthy. During one meeting, she suddenly noticed her boyfriend's beautiful watch but felt embarrassed to ask him about the brand, fearing he would look down on her for being materialistic. So, she secretly took a picture of his watch with her phone. Although she didn't understand watches and never figured out what brand it was later, her worry about her boyfriend discovering this incident grew stronger by the day. As a result, even when she saw her boyfriend or others normally, she became anxious about being suspected of having moral issues. From that point on, it spiraled out of control; the obsessive scrutiny, along with compulsive thoughts resisting this matter, emerged, leading her to fear normal social interactions and ultimately developing into social anxiety disorder!", "This part is addressed in hypnotherapy, but it still seems unable to explain why the case is so severe. It appears that this matter is a trigger, and the psychological issues of the case must be hidden even deeper.

The experience of love after graduating from university for the first time repeated and reinforced these symptoms: She went on a business trip to Japan with a male colleague from the same company. During the trip, he showed her a lot of care, often bringing her flowers, chocolates, and romantic invitations. She also started to develop feelings and longed for a happy love and future family life, so she embraced him and they ended up in bed together, ultimately falling in love! However, she later discovered that he was equally affectionate and flirty with other girls and recently had a wife, making her the other woman! Although she regretted it, she was still unable to extricate herself and continued the secret relationship. Eventually, due to his own reasons, he left the company and publicly revealed their secret affair to everyone when he left... It was a super forced and coercive situation!! Privacy!! Dignity!! Secrets!! Keeping secrets and leaking secrets!!... After breaking up with him, she developed a huge psychological shadow and obstacle regarding her later relationships with other men!", "Since then, it has returned to the recent situation where I wanted to pay attention to my current boyfriend's branded watch, but was worried about being despised and looked down upon by him, which ultimately erupted into today's condition: obsessive-compulsive disorder and social anxiety disorder."], "experience_and_reflection": "Since then, the exploration of hypnosis has found the ins and outs of the cause, and the treatment has come to a perfect conclusion. Reflecting on this case, I am struck by the profound interplay of past experiences, subconscious guilt, and present psychological manifestations. This case exemplifies the intricate layers of human psychology, where early life experiences, familial dynamics, and personal choices converge to create complex psychological patterns.\n\nThe initial challenge was to understand the depth of the client's insomnia and its underlying causes. Through the hypnotherapy sessions, it became evident that her sleeplessness was not merely a surface-level issue but a symptom of deeper emotional unrest. Her inability to find solace in sleep was closely tied to unresolved guilt and self-recrimination stemming from her relationship with her father. This insight highlights the critical role that familial relationships play in shaping our psychological well-being. The client's subconscious mind had internalized the guilt from her father's tragic death, and this unresolved emotional turmoil was manifesting as insomnia.\n\nIn hypnosis, I allowed her to fully express her emotions for every experience she had, facilitating new cognitive coverage and enhancement, inspiring positive insights and meanings. The process of verbalizing her feelings in a safe and guided environment allowed her to confront the guilt she harbored towards her father. This was a pivotal moment in the therapeutic process, as it provided her with the opportunity to forgive herself and seek forgiveness from her father in her mind. The act of forgiveness, both giving and receiving, is a powerful therapeutic tool that can lead to profound emotional healing.\n\nMoreover, the exploration of her past relationships shed light on her patterns of attachment and self-worth. Her failed relationships, marked by secrecy and betrayal, had reinforced her feelings of inadequacy and fear of judgment. The memory of her first love affair, where she found herself entangled in a web of deceit, had left a lasting scar on her psyche. This experience not only affected her subsequent relationships but also contributed to her social anxiety disorder. Her fear of being judged and her tendency to keep secrets were deeply rooted in this formative experience.\n\nThe hypnotherapy session was completed, and the client let out a deep sigh, releasing all grievances and disputes. No longer feeling forced, confused, or afraid, they walked out of my hypnotherapy clinic with a bright heart and full confidence, heading towards a better life tomorrow. This transformation was not just about alleviating symptoms but about facilitating a fundamental shift in her self-perception and worldview. The power of hypnosis lies in its ability to access the subconscious mind, where these deep-seated beliefs and emotions reside, and to reframe them in a way that promotes healing and growth.\n\nThe client's journey also underscores the importance of addressing subconscious influences and the narratives we carry from our past. Her compulsive behaviors, such as the obsessive focus on jewelry and watches, were symptomatic of a deeper psychological conflict. These behaviors were her mind's way of coping with feelings of inadequacy and fear of judgment. By delving into her subconscious mind, we were able to uncover the origins of these behaviors and reframe them in a more constructive and empowering context.\n\nFurthermore, the case highlights the interconnectedness of psychological and physiological symptoms. Her insomnia, compulsive behaviors, and social anxiety were not isolated issues but rather interconnected manifestations of her underlying emotional distress. This holistic understanding is crucial in psychotherapy, as it allows for a more comprehensive and effective treatment approach. By addressing the root causes of her distress, we were able to bring about a more lasting and meaningful change.\n\nReflecting on the therapeutic process, I am reminded of the importance of empathy and understanding in psychotherapy. The client's journey was fraught with emotional pain and self-doubt, and it was essential to create a therapeutic space where she felt safe and supported. The trust and rapport we built were instrumental in facilitating her healing process. As clinicians, we must approach each case with compassion and an open mind, recognizing that each individual's experiences and emotions are unique and deserving of validation.\n\nIn conclusion, this case serves as a powerful reminder of the transformative potential of hypnotherapy. By accessing the subconscious mind and facilitating a deeper understanding of the self, we can help clients uncover the root causes of their distress and pave the way for healing and personal growth. The client's journey is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the capacity for change, even in the face of profound emotional challenges.

{"id": 3, "case_description": ["Visitor, female, 27 years old, undergraduate, employee, home is in Wuqing District, Tianjin. Married for three years. Over the past three years, due to intermittent medication, she has not had children. The visitor self-reports symptoms: has anxiety, which has recently relapsed and feels quite severe, inexplicably irritable every day, sometimes experiences chest tightness and a burning sensation in the back, has been on medication for control but has not fully recovered. A long time ago, she visited a private counseling clinic for a psychological consultation but felt the effect was not good and did not continue."], "consultation_process": ["3. Consultation Objective: How to address the visitor's anxiety issues?", "IV. Consultation Process: It has been 11 days since the last consultation. This is the fourth consultation! During today's session, after half an hour, the client expressed feelings of disappointment regarding the consultation. The client said that apart from the first session, she felt that the second and third sessions were discussing matters unrelated to her, which made her very disappointed and led her to consider changing therapists! I then transparently shared my thoughts and feelings: I mentioned that I also felt our consultations were not normal; typically, the first session may not yield significant results, but as the consultations progress, the effects of the second and third sessions become increasingly evident. However, in our case, it seemed reversed: the first session felt particularly effective, while the second and third sessions seemed to yield diminishing returns. Why was that? At that moment, I suddenly realized that I indeed had a fixation (preconception): I believed that postmodern psychological counseling should de-pathologize; excessive discussion of the client's symptoms might suggest to the client and exacerbate their anxiety. Therefore, in the second and third sessions, I had been trying to avoid discussing the client's symptoms, focusing instead on analyzing the underlying causes of the client's issues and exploring their relationships with others, hoping to find resources in the client's interpersonal relationships to help them enhance their coping abilities. Additionally, in this case's consultation, I was influenced by another similar case: another anxious client was already on their ninth session, and they consistently struggled to confront their own anxiety. In the last consultation, I attempted to encourage that client to face their anxiety and externalize those feelings, but they immediately requested to talk about happier topics. By discussing joyful matters and continually recognizing the relational resources around the client, it reduced their feelings of loneliness and helplessness and provided new insights into their character trait of \"lacking inner security but feeling hesitant to trouble others\" (this is a typical anxious attachment client). However, the current client’s personality was clearly different from that anxious attachment client; they wanted to discuss anxiety issues in every session, while I felt that we had already addressed the anxiety issue in the first session, and it was time to delve into deeper levels of counseling. Yet, it seemed that this deeper consultation could not find an entry point, as the client explicitly told me, \"I just want to discuss how I should cope with anxiety; my problems are not related to my family, so there’s no need to discuss my growth experiences or the impact of my marital relationship on me; all my relationships are pretty good!\" Previously, I would have thought this was the client's resistance, but after studying Chapter 9 of \"Reflective Teams in Action\" and yesterday’s supervision in a personal growth group, I immediately became aware of this realization about myself: I was being hijacked by my own preconceptions and counseling experience, and I was avoiding the client's counseling needs! After this realization, I promptly adjusted the direction of the consultation, focusing on the client and the issues they cared about. The client said, \"This is her own war with herself!\" So, I then focused the goal of the consultation on \"how the client is waging war with herself.\"", "Here are a series of questions I pose to clients during consultations: What is the relationship between the client and her anxiety? What are the patterns of interaction? What does the client envision her life to be like after recovery? The client mentions that she is actually \"the one making herself anxious,\" so how does she perceive this thought pattern? How does she make herself anxious? The client explicitly requests that the counselor \"not ask for reasons, only focus on the present, and concentrate on the outcomes of the counseling\"! This may be disallowed for classical psychoanalysts, but for postmodern counselors, \"there are no fixed rules.\" We will explore the infinite possibilities of the counseling process with the client, with an attitude of equality, respect, and humility!", "Through exploration, the visitor focused on their personality traits: \"I always feel nervous and afraid when facing issues, and I tend to overthink.\" How did this thought pattern develop? What is the difference between \"overthinking and daydreaming\"? Previously, we discussed situations after they occurred and our coping methods. Now let's explore how we perceive these situations and discuss our attitudes towards them. How does the \"anxiety disorder label\" affect you? The effect of a label comes from how you view it; what impact does it bring? The visitor gained new insight about themselves: they are someone who overthinks and tends to nitpick! I asked if this personality trait affects areas other than their insomnia and anxiety. The visitor said they used to be someone who overthought and nitpicked even before their anxiety, which is a characteristic of their personality! (Regarding their new discovery). (I) So what does this personality bring you? (Visitor) Overthinking—tiring—annoying—anxiety! (I) What are the benefits of overthinking for you? (Visitor) A meticulous thought process when doing things, avoiding unexpected occurrences. (I) How do you view \"overthinking\"? Or what is your attitude towards it? The visitor said there is no good or bad in overthinking! When our thought pattern of overthinking is adjusted, could it help with your nervousness and anxiety? The visitor said, \"I overthink and do less!\" They mentioned that their \"overthinking\" often refers to \"daydreaming,\" which is definitely not a good thing. I asked them to describe specifically: why is daydreaming not good, and how does it affect your actions? (Specificity technique). The visitor said that \"overthinking\" might have a positive meaning. However, they said that \"daydreaming\" involves thinking about negative things, which makes them feel exhausted and makes it very difficult to act, leading to a lack of hope. Therefore, they often feel overwhelmed when doing tasks, resulting in \"overthinking and doing less\"! Next, the visitor asked how they could face daydreaming calmly. (Then I used the hypothetical technique from solution-focused therapy) If we are no longer intimidated by the difficulties of daydreaming and just grit our teeth to do it and succeed, how would you feel at that moment? The visitor said: If I succeed, I would feel happy and fulfilled. How would you feel if you approached past daydreaming with this mindset? If you had this successful experience once, twice, three times... or even countless times, what impact would these successful experiences have on your overthinking when faced with situations? You said your irritability comes from overthinking, but if you approach things without being intimidated by daydreaming and adopt a natural and carefree attitude to act, and you succeed, would your feelings about your irritability change? Did you have any successful experiences in the past, even with small things? The visitor couldn't recall anything at the moment, but that's okay. Even without success, would you be willing to try experiencing it with the teacher? I used the metaphor of \"fleas in a glass jar\" to illustrate the negative impact of failure experiences on individuals. At the end, I employed an individual reflection team technique to reflect on the entire counseling process, transparently sharing some of my thoughts and feelings, and acknowledging that I led the counseling down a wrong path due to assumptions and not paying attention to the visitor's expectations. I affirmed the visitor's courage to express their thoughts and feelings and their genuine needs for the interview, which plays a crucial role in advancing our psychological counseling! I sincerely thanked the visitor!", "V. Case Analysis: During these 11 days, I scheduled appointments with the client several times before finally settling on a time. The client mentioned that \"he tends to overthink and has a tendency to grumble.\" This reflects the client's personality traits. Dealing with such a client introduces more uncertainty into our counseling and presents greater challenges for the counselor. In fact, a case can have many different entry points during the counseling process. The true test of a counselor's ability lies in recognizing these entry points and seizing the opportunity to open up our dialogue space and enter the client's inner world. Our counseling has now entered a deeper phase, with the client beginning to turn his attention inward and start reflecting on himself!", "6. Reflection on the success or failure of consultation goals: Why do clients want to change their counselor? It is because our consultation goals have not focused on the clients themselves. So what are consultation goals? I believe it is whether our consultation addresses the current psychological needs of the clients! How can we address the psychological needs of the clients? It depends on whether the counselor can let go of their own preconceptions and consultation routines, and take on the role of a learner and listener, to truly hear the clients' inner feelings and needs. When the clients' feelings and needs are genuinely heard, I believe the direction of our consultation will adjust. Moreover, when clients express the desire to change counselors, if the counselor still cannot see the direction of the consultation, it indicates that we need to seek supervision!"], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflection on the Consultation Process:\n\nReflecting on my journey with this client, I am struck by the complexities and nuances inherent in psychotherapy. The process of therapy is not a linear path; it ebbs and flows, often requiring us to revisit our assumptions and methodologies. Throughout this case, I have encountered several pivotal moments that prompted me to critically evaluate my approach, leading to a deeper understanding of both the client's needs and my role as a facilitator of their journey.\n\n1. Navigating the Terrain of Client Expectations:\n\nIn the early sessions, I grappled with the challenge of aligning my therapeutic approach with the client's expectations. The client expressed dissatisfaction with our progress, considering changing counselors. This moment was a wake-up call, urging me to critically reflect on my strategies. My inclination to avoid symptom-focused discussions, driven by a postmodern belief in de-pathologizing, inadvertently overlooked the client's explicit desire to address her anxiety head-on. This realization underscored the importance of flexibility in therapy, reminding me that the client's voice must guide the therapeutic journey.\n\n2. The Art of Balancing Theory and Client-Centered Practice:\n\nThe suggestion to explore \"Morita Therapy\" with the client, though well-intentioned, highlighted a critical lesson in the application of theoretical frameworks. While therapeutic literature can provide valuable insights, it cannot replace the tailored, client-specific interventions essential in psychotherapy. The client's dismissive response to book recommendations reminded me that therapy transcends mere theoretical application; it demands an attuned, creative approach that acknowledges the client's unique context and needs. This experience reinforced the notion that therapy is an art—dynamic, personalized, and deeply human.\n\n3. Re-evaluating Homework Assignments:\n\nThe client's reluctance to engage in homework assignments led me to reconsider the role of such tasks in therapy. Initially, I perceived structured activities as valuable tools for fostering self-awareness and coping strategies. However, the client's feedback revealed the potential for such tasks to exacerbate distress. This insight prompted me to embrace a collaborative approach in designing therapeutic activities, ensuring that they resonate with the client's preferences and existing coping mechanisms. Encouraging the client to share their methods, such as daily planning and summarizing, opened new avenues for therapeutic exploration, fostering a sense of agency and ownership in the process.\n\n4. Deconstructing Labels and Exploring Attitudes:\n\nDespite our efforts to deconstruct the \"anxiety disorder\" label, the client continued to wrestle with its implications. This struggle illuminated the intricate relationship between self-perception and mental health. Our exploration of the client's subjective awareness and interpretations of discomfort marked a turning point, shifting the focus from symptom management to an examination of underlying attitudes. This shift encouraged the client to reconsider their relationship with anxiety, emphasizing self-reflection and self-acceptance as pivotal components of the therapeutic journey.\n\n5. Recognizing the Interplay of Personality and Upbringing:\n\nThe client's acknowledgment of the connection between their personality and upbringing marked a significant breakthrough. This realization, once vehemently resisted, emerged through our collaborative exploration of personality traits such as \"overthinking and small grievances.\" By framing this inquiry as a subjective interpretation rather than a definitive truth, I facilitated a space for the client to consider the impact of early life experiences on their current self-concept. This approach underscored the value of gentle, non-imposing inquiry in fostering client insight and growth.\n\n6. Understanding Temporal Patterns of Anxiety:\n\nThe client's reflection on the temporal patterns of their anxiety—experiencing symptoms intermittently rather than continuously—offered valuable insights into the nature of their distress. This pattern, characterized by episodic rather than chronic anxiety, prompted us to delve deeper into the factors influencing these fluctuations. By recognizing the cyclical nature of anxiety, we could focus on identifying specific triggers and developing targeted coping strategies, thereby enhancing the client's sense of control and agency in managing their condition.\n\n7. Building a Therapeutic Alliance Through Dialogue:\n\nThe timely adjustment of our consultation direction facilitated the establishment of a strong therapeutic alliance. By ceasing discussions on coping methods and shifting our focus to exploring attitudes towards anxiety, we opened a dialogue space that encouraged the client to introspectively examine their personality traits. This introspection allowed the client to shift their attention from external problems to internal processes, fostering self-awareness and promoting therapeutic depth.\n\n8. The Role of Supervision in Professional Growth:\n\nThroughout this case, I have come to appreciate the indispensable role of supervision in refining my therapeutic skills. Encountering challenges and uncertainties highlighted the areas where I needed to grow, prompting me to seek guidance and feedback from experienced colleagues. Supervision provided a reflective space to explore my assumptions, biases, and blind spots, ultimately enhancing my ability to attune to the client's needs and adjust my approach accordingly. This commitment to ongoing learning and self-reflection is essential in maintaining the integrity and efficacy of the therapeutic process.\n\n9. Encouraging Client Agency and Resilience:\n\nIn recognizing the client's resilience and resourcefulness, I encouraged them to experiment with new approaches to managing anxiety, emphasizing the importance of self-compassion and self-reward. This empowerment-focused strategy aimed to foster a sense of autonomy and confidence, reinforcing the client's capacity to navigate challenges and embrace personal growth. By celebrating small successes and reframing setbacks as opportunities for learning, we cultivated a therapeutic environment that nurtured resilience and encouraged proactive engagement with life's uncertainties.\n\n10. Addressing Feelings of Failure and Powerlessness:\n\nA significant aspect of this case was the client's pervasive sense of failure and powerlessness in combating anxiety. This emotional undercurrent, initially overlooked, became a focal point for exploration. By acknowledging and validating these feelings, we created a space for the client to express vulnerability and reflect on the origins of their distress. Understanding the roots of these emotions allowed us to collaboratively develop strategies for reclaiming agency and fostering a sense of empowerment, ultimately transforming feelings of defeat into opportunities for growth and resilience.\n\nIn conclusion, this case has been a profound learning experience, underscoring the importance of attuning to the client's voice, embracing flexibility, and fostering a collaborative therapeutic alliance. By continually reflecting on my practice and seeking supervision, I aim to enhance my ability to navigate the complexities of psychotherapy, ultimately supporting clients in their journey towards healing and self-discovery.", "causes": "Emotional repression (guilt) and psychological needs\n(deprivation, low self-worth) caused by personality traits\n(sensitivity, pursuit of perfection) and current life events are not met, resulting in anxiety and physical discomfort", "symptoms": "Anxiety, insomnia, and physiological reactions (chest tightness and back burning)", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection;\nListening & Empathy: Building Relationships;\nShort-term focused solving: finding resources through interpersonal and early experiences;\nNarrative Therapy: Promotes self-awareness", "characteristics_of_illness": "Intermittent anxiety, the client's desire to focus on the\nproblem and approach rather than seeking resources", "treatment_effect": "Due to the timely feedback from the client, the counseling strategy was adjusted, and the focus shifted from focusing on resources to self-exploration, which more accurately and\neffectively met the needs of the client, promoted the\nreconstruction of the counseling relationship, and provided a new direction for the consultation."}

Through the interview with Xiaoxin, I utilized cognitive behavioral therapy to gradually change her later behaviors by altering her beliefs and thought patterns. The first step was to help Xiaoxin forgive herself for introducing her friend to her husband, alleviating her feelings of regret and guilt. Next, through counseling, Xiaoxin came to understand that relentless accusations and complaints would only push her husband further away, and that the reasons for her husband's betrayal of the family were not solely due to external temptations, but stemmed from serious issues within their marriage. This led Xiaoxin to confront the problems in her marriage with her husband and to focus on how to maintain their relationship, rather than getting entangled in his past betrayal.", "Excerpt from the consultation process:", "Psychologist: From your narrative, I can sense that you are currently feeling angry, irritable, anxious, sad, disappointed, and regretful. You and your husband are college classmates who have experienced many ups and downs together over the years. You have supported each other and are very loving, and you have a cute 5-year-old baby. Who would have thought that because of you, your husband met your friend, which led to his current infidelity? So, since this incident occurred, you have been feeling very regretful. Is that correct?", "Visitor: Yes, I regret it very much. I regret introducing my friend to my husband at that time. I didn't expect him to encourage my husband to go to the bar, giving him the chance to meet that woman.", "Counselor: I understand how you feel; you are currently overwhelmed with regret. However, initially, your intention was good when you introduced your husband to your friends, wasn't it?", "Visitor: Well, yes, because that friend is a colleague of my husband, so I introduced them to each other in hopes that it would be helpful for my husband's work in the future.", "Counselor: Well, while feeling regret, please also remember your original kindness and good intentions, okay? Because in your regret, you are actually also hating yourself and constantly blaming yourself, right?", "Visitor: Um, yes. I wish I could let go of these too.", "Counselor, well, I understand. So you can choose to continue blaming yourself, or you can choose to be more forgiving towards yourself. After all, none of us could have predicted what would happen in the future from the very beginning, could we?", "Visitor: Well, I think so. I think I would be willing to treat myself with a bit more tolerance.", "Counselor: Well, you have that option, which will be very helpful in improving your mood, and I think your choice is the right one; you are doing very well. Now, let's talk about you and your husband, okay?", "It's been half a year since the incident occurred. You and your husband have argued and fought, but what has been the outcome? He still doesn't admit it, does he? I want to ask, how is your relationship as a couple now? Is there a big difference compared to more than half a year ago? If this continues, do you think your relationship with your husband will worsen?

Two, continue to relentlessly question your husband about this objective fact from six months ago that you cannot change, which will not only torment him but also push him further away from you, leading to mutual blame, misunderstanding, resentment, and ultimately separation. So, which outcome do you prefer?", "Client: Teacher, thank you very much for your analysis! Yes, if the objective facts that already exist are truly as he said, and nothing really happened, just something I imagined, then forcing him every day would make him feel very wronged! If something did happen, it has already become a fact, and we cannot go back or change it!", "Client: Actually, besides when we argue, I feel that our relationship is still the same as before. He is still treating me the same as always, but I always have a knot in my heart. Sometimes when I watch TV and see similar situations, I use words to mock him. In life, he takes me everywhere he goes now, and whenever he has time, he takes me and our baby to the supermarket or the park! Psychologist: From your narration, I can sense your husband's efforts and changes. If you ask yourself honestly, is your relationship with your husband really the same as before? The reason you are suffering so much now is precisely because you have lost the most basic sense of trust in him, right? Yes, perhaps he still treats you the same way, but if you continue to be entangled in this matter endlessly over time, do you think your husband’s attitude towards you will change? In fact, I can feel that you love your husband very much and care about him, which is why you are so bothered by this issue. Since you love him so deeply, why not choose to trust him?", "Client: Yes, teacher, you are absolutely right. I choose to trust him and don’t want to regret it when our originally good relationship is worn away. But I would like to ask you how I can rebuild trust. I am naturally a suspicious woman, and after this incident, whenever his phone rings, I instinctively want to know who it is and what’s going on. I often check his QQ chat history for no reason, even though I know there’s nothing there. Am I being pathological now? I am very confused. I understand all the reasoning, but I just can’t fully let go, and it really troubles me!

It feels like there are two versions of myself fighting each other!", "Psychological counselor: When your husband's phone rings, you instinctively want to know who it is and what it's about. You often find yourself checking his QQ chat history, which reflects your subconscious fear that your husband might betray you emotionally again. You want to hold onto him, but do you think your current behavior will really lead to his understanding and acceptance? Perhaps it may only have the opposite effect? You say you are naturally suspicious; what experiences have led you to feel so insecure and doubtful? You worry excessively that your husband might cheat again; why do you lack confidence in yourself?

I will do my best!", "In the following consultations, I reinforced the cognitive concepts and behavioral patterns that Xiaoxin had newly established, helped her learn methods and techniques for interacting with her husband, and taught her how to change her communication style with him. At the same time, I used hypnosis to set a mental anchor, helping her build self-confidence and become increasingly calm and open-minded."], "experience_and_reflection": "Effect: After eight sessions of counseling, Xiaoxin and her husband's relationship has noticeably improved, and she has gradually let go of her previous psychological burdens. This counseling process has brought about a significant transformation in Xiaoxin, and she has expressed a strong desire to continue attending sessions. She feels she has gained a lot from the process, and her journey of self-discovery has been both enlightening and empowering. As her therapist, I am incredibly gratified to see the positive changes in her demeanor and outlook. Let me delve deeper into the insights and reflections from this case.\n\nInitially, Xiaoxin's emotional state was one of turmoil, characterized by anger, regret, and self-blame. Her tendency to internalize the blame for her husband's infidelity was a major obstacle that needed to be addressed. By helping her understand that her intentions were not malicious, we began dismantling the foundations of her self-blame. This process was pivotal in allowing her to forgive herself, which, in turn, laid the groundwork for her to forgive her husband. Through cognitive behavioral therapy, Xiaoxin learned to challenge and modify her thought patterns, which were steeped in negativity and suspicion. This was not an easy journey for her, as it required confronting deep-seated beliefs and emotions. However, by acknowledging her feelings and recognizing the irrational nature of her guilt, she began to see herself and her situation in a new light.\n\nOne of the most critical aspects of Xiaoxin's transformation was her ability to recognize the intrinsic issues within her marriage that may have contributed to her husband's infidelity. This recognition was a double-edged sword; while it brought her closer to the reality of her marital problems, it also empowered her to address these issues constructively. This newfound insight allowed her to shift her focus from a cycle of blame and regret to one of problem-solving and reconciliation. Xiaoxin's case highlights the importance of addressing underlying marital issues rather than attributing blame solely to external factors. The infidelity served as a catalyst for change, forcing both Xiaoxin and her husband to reevaluate their relationship dynamics and communication patterns.\n\nThe counseling sessions also helped Xiaoxin understand the implications of her behavior on her husband's responses. Her tendency to accuse and suspect was pushing him further away, creating a vicious cycle of mistrust and resentment. By reframing her perspective and learning to communicate more effectively, Xiaoxin was able to create a more supportive and understanding environment. This shift not only improved their interactions but also helped rebuild the trust that had been eroded. Xiaoxin learned that trust is a two-way street and that her actions and attitudes could either fortify or undermine it.\n\nAn interesting aspect of this case was the use of hypnotherapy to reinforce positive cognitive and behavioral changes. Hypnotherapy served as a tool to set mental anchors, helping Xiaoxin build self-confidence and maintain her newfound calmness and open-mindedness. This technique complemented the cognitive behavioral therapy by reinforcing her mental resilience and aiding in the consolidation of her therapeutic gains. The mental anchors provided Xiaoxin with a sense of stability and assurance, helping her navigate the emotional complexities of her situation with greater ease.\n\nXiaoxin's journey also emphasized the importance of self-trust and self-healing. As she progressed through the sessions, she became more adept at trusting her instincts and making decisions that aligned with her values and goals. This self-trust was crucial in helping her regain control of her life and her relationship. By learning to heal herself, Xiaoxin was not only able to repair her marriage but also foster a deeper connection with herself. This dual healing process underscored the interdependence of personal growth and relationship enhancement.\n\nAs Xiaoxin continues her therapeutic journey, it is essential for her to remain vigilant of the progress she has made and the tools she has acquired. The path to healing and reconciliation is ongoing, and Xiaoxin's case serves as a testament to the power of introspection, empathy, and perseverance. I am confident that with continued support and guidance, Xiaoxin will continue to strengthen her relationship with her husband while also nurturing her own personal growth. As her therapist, I remain committed to supporting her journey and encouraging her to face future challenges with confidence and resilience.\n\nIn conclusion, Xiaoxin's case highlights several key insights into the therapeutic process for dealing with marital infidelity and emotional turmoil. It underscores the importance of self-forgiveness, addressing underlying marital issues, and rebuilding trust through effective communication. The integration of cognitive behavioral therapy and hypnotherapy proved to be an effective approach in facilitating Xiaoxin's transformation. Ultimately, this case reinforces the belief that with the right support and tools, individuals can overcome profound emotional challenges and emerge stronger, more resilient, and more connected to themselves and their loved ones.", "causes": "Emotional depression due to current intimate relationships and life events (feelings of blame, suspicion)", "symptoms": "Feelings of regret, doubt, and distrust", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection;\nListening & Empathy: Building Relationships;\nCognitive-behavioral therapy: adjusting self-perception and perception of others;\nHypnotherapy: Build self-confidence and consolidate results", "characteristics_of_illness": "Because she indirectly caused her husband to cheat, she\nshowed suspicion and compulsion", "treatment_effect": "I have developed a self-confident and calm mind, gained a more objective, comprehensive and in-depth understanding of myself and my relationship patterns, identified the deep-\nseated causes of marital problems, and improved my relationship and interaction with my husband"}

The visitor and her husband often had conflicts because of this woman, and he started to handle it indifferently, no longer paying attention to the visitor. She felt very sad and found it difficult to cope with this marital issue, so she sought help from a psychologist."], "experience_and_reflection": "Upon revisiting this case of marital counseling, additional reflections offer an opportunity to delve deeper into the complexities of marital dynamics, the interplay of personal histories, cultural influences, and therapeutic strategies that can enhance the couple's journey towards healing and reconciliation. As we expand upon the initial insights, let us explore the nuances that define this marriage, recognizing both the universal themes and the unique challenges faced by the couple.\n\nFirstly, the interaction pattern between the couple is emblematic of a broader spectrum of marital dynamics where miscommunication and unmet expectations often manifest as emotional disconnection. The visitor, characterized by a strong-willed personality, finds herself unable to empathize with her husband's experiences and feelings, leading to a pervasive cycle of frustration and diminished self-esteem on his part. This dynamic raises a pertinent question in marital therapy: how does one facilitate an environment where both partners feel appreciated and validated, ensuring that their contributions to the relationship are recognized and celebrated? The visitor's behavior, marked by criticism and blame, inadvertently undermines her husband's role within the family unit. Her tendency to take his contributions for granted without expressing gratitude may stem from deeper psychological patterns shaped by her own life experiences. In therapy, exploring these patterns can reveal underlying beliefs and assumptions that perpetuate such behavior. It's crucial to guide the visitor towards understanding the power of vulnerability in fostering intimacy and collaboration. Encouraging her to express her needs and acknowledge her husband's efforts can transform the marital landscape, creating a space where both partners feel empowered to contribute actively to the relationship.\n\nMoreover, the evolution of the couple's sexual life from frequent intimacy to a dwindling connection serves as a pivotal aspect of their marital journey. The initial phase of their marriage, marked by regular sexual activity, was gradually interrupted by the practicalities of life, including pregnancy and the child's health challenges. These interruptions highlight the need for a nuanced understanding of sexual dynamics within the marriage. The decline in frequency and quality of their sexual interactions reflects not only physical barriers but also emotional distancing. Addressing this issue involves acknowledging the multifaceted nature of sexual intimacy, which encompasses emotional, physical, and psychological dimensions. In therapy, it's essential to guide the couple in exploring the role of sexual intimacy as a conduit for emotional bonding and conflict resolution. Encouraging open dialogue about their sexual needs and desires can alleviate misconceptions and facilitate a mutual understanding of each other's expectations. The visitor's perception of sexual activity as an obligation rather than an opportunity for connection may be rooted in societal norms or personal insecurities. By fostering a safe environment for sexual exploration and communication, the couple can redefine their sexual relationship as a source of pleasure and connection, enhancing their emotional intimacy and strengthening their marital bond.\n\nThe significance of the marriage certificate as a symbolic anchor in the couple's relationship offers another layer of insight. Their impulsive decision to obtain a divorce certificate during a heated argument underscores the importance of rituals and symbolic gestures in reinforcing marital commitment. In therapy, exploring the psychological impact of such rituals can reveal their role in shaping perceptions of stability and permanence within the marriage. The marriage certificate, beyond its legal implications, serves as a psychological anchor that can instill a sense of accountability and responsibility in both partners. It acts as a reminder of the vows exchanged and the shared vision of a future together. In cultures where marriage is viewed through a ceremonial lens, the absence of such rituals can lead to ambivalence and a diminished sense of commitment. Therapy can guide the couple in exploring the emotional significance of their remarriage and the ways in which it can serve as a catalyst for renewed dedication to their partnership. Encouraging them to engage in intentional rituals that celebrate their union can reinforce their commitment and provide a framework for navigating future challenges.\n\nThe mother-in-law and daughter-in-law issue presents a unique opportunity to explore cultural influences and familial dynamics. This conflict, often rooted in power struggles and boundary ambiguities, is a reflection of broader societal norms and expectations. In therapy, it's crucial to address the cultural context that shapes these dynamics, particularly in societies where filial piety and familial cohesion are emphasized. The visitor's conflict with her mother-in-law can be viewed through the lens of intergenerational dynamics, where differing expectations and roles collide. By exploring the cultural narratives that influence these interactions, therapy can facilitate a deeper understanding of the underlying motivations and fears that drive such conflicts. Encouraging the visitor to approach her relationship with her mother-in-law from a place of empathy and understanding can pave the way for reconciliation and mutual respect. It's essential to guide the couple in establishing clear boundaries that honor both individual autonomy and familial obligations, fostering an environment where both partners feel supported and respected in their respective roles.\n\nFinally, establishing rules and boundaries within the marriage can serve as a powerful tool for conflict resolution and emotional healing. The visitor's experience of betrayal and infidelity necessitates a structured approach to rebuilding trust and fostering open communication. In therapy, setting clear expectations and boundaries can provide a framework for navigating complex emotions and rebuilding the marital foundation. Encouraging the couple to engage in regular check-ins and honest dialogues about their feelings and concerns can mitigate misunderstandings and prevent the recurrence of past grievances. Therapy can guide the couple in establishing a shared vision for their future, grounded in mutual respect and commitment. By fostering a collaborative approach to problem-solving, the couple can cultivate a resilient partnership capable of withstanding future challenges.\n\nIn summary, this expanded reflection underscores the complexity of marital dynamics, inviting a deeper exploration of the psychological, cultural, and relational factors that shape the couple's journey. By integrating these insights into the therapeutic process, we can guide the couple towards a path of healing and reconciliation, empowering them to create a fulfilling and enduring marital relationship.", "causes": "Emotional conflict caused by current life events", "symptoms": "Insomnia, anxiety, and mood swings", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection;\nListening & Empathy: Building Relationships;\nCognitive-behavioral therapy: adjusting self-perception and coping strategies (sex life, communication style, sense of ritual, rule-building, etc.);\nSummary and outlook", "characteristics_of_illness": "There are problems in the relationship between mother-in- law and daughter-in-law, which leads to damage to the marital relationship", "treatment_effect": "By exploring and understanding the impact of one's life experiences on interpersonal patterns, a foundation is laid for subsequently easing relationships through means such as ritualistic practices."}

After his girlfriend was admitted to university, he overcame numerous difficulties to take the same entrance exam and enroll in the same class as her. He came to our university just to be with his girlfriend and spend their college years together. This is a beautiful, fairy-tale-like love story that makes all the girls in the grade and even the entire school envious, amazed, and blessed.", "But it was precisely this boy who fell for my good friend Xiao A, which caused a stir among all the girls in the grade. A beautiful bubble was about to burst, and all the girls were targeting my friend Xiao A. Everyone knew I was Xiao A's best friend and asked me what was going on. I went to ask my good friend Xiao A, and she said there was nothing. I told her she shouldn't! I went back to the seven or eight girls and patted my chest, saying, \"No! I guarantee there is nothing!\" They dispersed.", "Afterwards, that boy also came to me to express his frustrations about how Xiao A was distancing herself from him. Sometimes he would invite me out for meals and chats, and other times we would take walks around campus to talk.

The retrospective teacher asked me about her appearance and my feelings when I saw her walk away. I looked at that familiar figure and felt very sad and lost. The light shone on her face, and I looked again at her expression when she encountered me.

What was I doing?! It turns out I really did help, at least I relieved the boy's worries. I shattered the fairy-tale-like love that everyone cherished; I am an accomplice! Really, after realizing this, my initial grievances gradually faded away, and I truly did indirectly hurt that sad girlfriend.

Her undergraduate experience was pivotal, marked by the unfolding of events that seemed almost like a social and emotional trial. The social dynamics of her dormitory life, combined with the betrayal she felt from friends, created an emotional environment that was rife with tension and misunderstanding. The incident involving Xiao A, the boy, and the ex-girlfriend led to a cascade of social fallout, leaving the client feeling isolated and targeted. These events were not just interpersonal conflicts; they were deeply traumatic experiences that shaped her perception of friendships and trust.\n\nThe client’s recollection of the isolation she faced in the dormitory, particularly the hostility from her roommate, underscores the intense psychological stress she endured. Her narrative reveals a pattern of being caught in the middle, attempting to mediate or assist, yet inadvertently becoming the focus of blame and resentment. This created a profound sense of vulnerability and self-doubt, as she grappled with the notion of being perceived as an accomplice despite her intentions to help resolve the conflicts. Her reflections during the therapy sessions highlight a critical realization: while her intentions were to aid and mediate, her actions were interpreted differently by her peers, leading to a painful misalignment between intention and perception.\n\nThe hypnosis and imagery dialogue sessions facilitated a deeper understanding of her internalized guilt and the fear of judgment that has permeated her interactions since then. The realization that she played a role, albeit unintended, in the emotional upheaval experienced by her peers was crucial. This acknowledgment allowed her to reconcile with the past, not by negating her feelings of being wronged, but by understanding the perspectives of those around her. The therapy enabled her to see the incident from a broader viewpoint, revealing the complexities of human relationships and the subjective nature of social narratives.\n\nThe therapeutic process also illuminated the client’s transition from undergraduate to graduate studies, where she carried the scars of past experiences into new social contexts. Her friendship with Xiao B, once a source of joy and companionship, became another chapter in her story of interpersonal challenges. The abrupt end of this friendship, marked by a sudden and unspoken animosity, further entrenched her fears of relational instability. The imagery work in therapy allowed her to revisit these moments with Xiao B, revealing the underlying fears and unresolved emotions that had haunted her since.\n\nThis journey through therapy has been transformative for the client. By addressing the unresolved conflicts and revisiting the painful memories with the aid of hypnosis, she was able to disentangle herself from the web of past grievances. The process of introspection and dialogue not only helped her recognize her role in the dynamics but also empowered her to forgive herself and others. She expressed an earnest desire to reconnect, particularly with Xiao B, demonstrating growth and a willingness to embrace vulnerability once more. The warmth and resolution she felt during the imagery dialogue with Xiao B signified a pivotal moment of healing, where past grievances were met with understanding and empathy.\n\nFurthermore, the regression sessions extended into exploring her marital conflicts, which revealed patterns of communication rooted in past anxieties. The therapy provided a safe space to explore these marital dynamics, allowing her to recognize how her fears of rejection and judgment had influenced her interactions with her husband. The therapeutic process enabled her to develop healthier communication strategies, fostering a deeper connection with her partner and alleviating fears of conflict.\n\nOverall, the client’s journey through therapy has been a testament to her resilience and capacity for growth. The insights gained from the hypnosis communication and imagery dialogue have equipped her with the tools to navigate future social interactions with confidence and openness. She has learned to embrace her past not as a series of failures but as experiences that have shaped her understanding and empathy. With a renewed sunny mindset, she is poised to approach life’s challenges with optimism and a stronger sense of self, ready to forge meaningful connections that reflect her true, bright, and cheerful nature.", "causes": "Emotional conflict due to past traumatic life events\n(friendship breakdown) and early experiences", "symptoms": "Depression, anxiety, and relationship disorders", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection;\nListening & Empathy: Building Relationships;\nHypnosis and Intentional Dialogue: Relive memories of the past with friends and gain a new perspective on problems;\nSummary and outlook", "characteristics_of_illness": "The early patriarchal family environment is intertwined with the breakdown of acquired friendships, which leads to\npsychological problems", "treatment_effect": "The suppressed emotions can be expressed and relieved, the\ndeep causes of their fears and anxieties can be clarified, a positive and positive attitude and behavior pattern are established, and\npsychological resilience and self-confidence are enhanced"}

Sasha's husband loves her very much, and they are considered a perfect match. To others, Sasha appears to be happy, with a successful career and a blissful family; everything seems so wonderful. However, one issue has troubled Sasha for many years: every morning, she is plagued by the need to have a bowel movement. After getting out of bed, her mind automatically switches to anxiety mode, worrying whether she can complete her bowel movement smoothly. She fears that not finishing will affect her health and her mood for the entire day, so she spends a considerable amount of time each morning until she feels she has finished. After previously undergoing surgery for hemorrhoids, she is also concerned that taking too long will cause them to return, which makes her feel extremely anxious about the whole process. Recently, she has felt that she cannot clean herself properly, which fills her with fear, anxiety, and irritability, preventing her from concentrating at work. Additionally, feeling that her husband cannot understand her pain, she has frequently lost her temper with him, causing him to share in her anxiety. Now, she senses that her hemorrhoids are flaring up again, which terrifies her and makes her worry about being hospitalized again. Therefore, during her morning bowel movements, her anxiety intensifies; she is afraid to exert herself or take too long, but the feeling of not being finished causes her even more distress. She feels she can no longer endure the torment of this dreadful bowel movement and seeks help."], "consultation_process": ["After Sasa came to the consultation room, she appeared somewhat shy and reserved in front of the male counselor, feeling embarrassed to express her inner feelings directly. In order to help her relax, lower her internal defenses, and build a trusting counseling relationship, I suggested that she draw a house-tree-person drawing. Sasa agreed with my idea, and after I explained the drawing requirements to her, she began to draw on the paper.", "Sasha first drew a large and spacious old-fashioned brick house with double doors and two beautiful windows. There was a chimney on the upper left side of the house, and she also drew a slightly elevated doorstep. Next, Sasha drew two lush trees next to the house on the left, and on the right side of the paper, she drew a fruit tree with six large fruits on it. Then, in the upper left corner of the paper, Sasha drew a sun radiating light. Next to the sun, she drew two clouds, and in the upper right corner of the house, she drew two small birds flying to the right. Later, Sasha drew a large road at the bottom of the paper, with neatly arranged flowers and grass on both sides. She also drew a small stone path connecting the house and the road, with flowers and grass alongside it as well. Then, Sasha drew a small pond by the roadside, where two fish were playing. After finishing these, Sasha began to draw people; she first drew a girl with long hair, dressed appropriately, and exuding charm. Just as I thought Sasha's drawing was nearing completion, I saw her start to refine the figures in the drawing. She redrew the hair, eyes, mouth, facial features, hands, clothes, and shoes with a pencil, but she still wasn't satisfied. So she began to erase the figures she had just drawn, and then started over. After finishing, Sasha began to outline again, repeating this process. It wasn't until the fourth time, when she felt satisfied with the figure, that she stopped making changes. When she handed the drawing to me, I could clearly see the noticeable color difference in the areas where she had drawn the figures and the surroundings.", "After looking at Sasha's paintings, it is evident that she is a girl who demands perfection from herself. Throughout her growth, she has received a relatively abundant amount of love, and her parents have always been very caring, especially her mother's strong love has had a greater impact on her. From the paintings, it can be seen that Sasha is currently quite satisfied with her work, her interpersonal communication is relatively smooth, and her relationship with her husband is harmonious, but she is not satisfied with her current self. So I shared my observations from the paintings with Sasha, and she expressed her agreement, feeling that it instantly brought us closer together.", "So I talked to Shasha about several things she painted.", "Counselor: Your parents and husband give you a lot of love, and you feel very safe inside now.", "Sasha: Yes, it makes me feel very happy.", "Counselor: Mom is a very demanding person, isn't she?", "Sasha: Yes, my mom is very strict and has high expectations for me, and she wants everything to be perfect.", "Counselor: I see you drew six fruits, why is that?", "Sasha: Everything goes smoothly, I like this number!", "Counselor: I see that you made four revisions to the person in the painting. Is it because you were not satisfied?", "Sasha: Yes, I don't know why, I always feel like she's not what I really want!", "Counselor: But I see that there is basically not much difference between the last one and the first one?", "Sasha: Yes, there's not much difference. You can see that the person now is wearing a ring on her hand.", "Counselor: You feel that by putting on this ring, she becomes the perfect woman, right?", "Sasha: Yes, at least I think she is perfect?", "Counselor: What if she doesn't have a ring? Or what if she says her ring is lost?", "Sasha: I will feel pain and anxiety, I can't accept it, maybe I will buy another one that's exactly the same.", "Counselor: Is it that feeling in control of everything makes you feel safe?", "Sasha: Yes, I like the feeling of being in control; that's when I feel perfect and can gain the recognition of others.", "Counselor: What if you feel like you can't take control? You feel like you've lost yourself, right?", "Sasha: Yes, I feel like I don't exist, and I am unwilling to accept that version of myself.", "Counselor: Actually, you know that even if you don't achieve perfection, you are still you; it's just that you are unwilling to accept it, right?", "Sasha: Yes, it's my unwillingness to accept that feeling, which can be painful.", "Counselor: But no one is perfect, right? Just like Venus, which feels incomplete yet very real. Many people consider it a beauty in imperfection, don't they?", "Sasha: Yes, I think I do set my expectations too high for myself. Sometimes I feel tired and feel like I'm not being authentic. Perhaps I should consider what the real me is like.", "Counselor: Yes, because your pursuit of perfection makes you want to control more and seek more praise, right?", "Sasha: Yes, I hope so.", "Counselor: But this approach makes you feel that there are some things you cannot control, which brings you anxiety and causes you pain, right?", "Sasha: Yes...", "Through communicating with Sasha about the repeated modifications of the person in the painting, I saw a girl who holds herself to extremely high standards. We also smoothly delved into the issue of her anxiety about bowel movements, which troubles Sasha. Influenced by her mother, Sasha developed a perfectionist personality from a young age, insisting on doing everything flawlessly, which has brought her many benefits. However, she increasingly realizes that she cannot completely control her bowel movements, which makes her feel imperfect. In an attempt to regain control, she finds that the more she tries to control it, the more painful it becomes. This leads to her anxiety and feelings of frustration.", "So I analyzed it with Shasha to help her understand why she cared so much about her bowel movements, teaching her how to relax and learn to face and accept an imperfect version of herself!"], "experience_and_reflection": "In reflecting upon my work with Sasha, I find myself revisiting the intricate interplay between perfectionism, control, and anxiety. Sasha’s case underscores the profound impact that early familial relationships can have on an individual's personality development, particularly when it comes to expectations and self-perception. Sasha, having been nurtured in an environment where love was abundant yet conditional upon meeting high standards, developed a pattern of seeking validation through perfection. This mirrors the dynamic with her mother, whose high expectations have significantly shaped Sasha’s internal world. \n\nSasha's anxiety, particularly around her bowel movements, serves as a poignant illustration of how the need for control and perfection manifests in physical symptoms. The ritualistic nature of her morning routine, characterized by an intense focus on ensuring completeness and cleanliness, reflects a broader struggle to maintain control over her environment and self. This behavior, while providing temporary relief, ultimately exacerbates her anxiety, creating a vicious cycle. The anticipation of discomfort and the potential resurgence of her medical condition further fuel her apprehension, creating a scenario where the mind's need for control overrides the body's natural processes.\n\nIn our sessions, the use of the House-Tree-Person drawing technique proved invaluable in gently unraveling these layers. Sasha's artwork, rich with symbolism, provided a window into her psyche. The meticulous revisions she made to the figure in her drawing were telling of her perfectionist tendencies. It became clear that Sasha’s dissatisfaction with the drawing mirrored her dissatisfaction with herself. The repeated efforts to perfect the drawing of the person, despite minimal visible differences, were emblematic of her internal struggle to present an ideal self, one that she feels can only be complete with external markers of success or acceptance, like the ring she insisted upon including.\n\nOur discussions revealed Sasha's deep-seated belief that her value and safety are contingent upon achieving and maintaining this ideal state. Her mother's influence is evident here, as Sasha equates perfection with love and acceptance. This belief system, while providing motivation and drive, also becomes a source of profound distress when perfection is unattainable, as is often the case with natural bodily functions. The parallel between her drawing and her bowel movements is striking: both involve repeated attempts to achieve a sense of completeness and both ultimately leave her feeling dissatisfied and anxious when perfection eludes her.\n\nThe therapeutic process involved helping Sasha recognize and challenge these ingrained beliefs. Through our conversations, it became apparent that Sasha equates the loss of control with a loss of self. Her statement, \"I feel like I don't exist, and I am unwilling to accept that version of myself,\" speaks volumes about the existential nature of her anxiety. It was crucial to guide her towards understanding that her worth is not diminished by her inability to control every aspect of her life. Drawing parallels with Venus de Milo—a symbol of beauty in imperfection—was a particularly resonant metaphor for Sasha. It allowed her to begin contemplating the possibility of embracing her imperfections as part of her human experience.\n\nThe therapeutic journey with Sasha also highlighted the importance of flexibility in therapy techniques. While the House-Tree-Person technique served as an effective initial tool for engagement and exploration, the real therapeutic work involved creating a safe space where Sasha could explore these vulnerabilities without judgment. The establishment of a trusting relationship was paramount, as it enabled Sasha to open up about her fears and anxieties, which she initially found difficult to articulate due to feelings of shame and embarrassment.\n\nOne of the more profound realizations for me, as a clinician, was the extent to which Sasha's anxiety around bowel movements was intertwined with her relationship dynamics. Her husband's inability to fully grasp the depth of her anxiety resulted in feelings of isolation and frustration for Sasha. This dynamic reflected another dimension of her perfectionism: the expectation that others should understand and respond to her needs in the way she envisions. Addressing this relational aspect became a key component of our work, as it was essential for Sasha to recognize the impact of her expectations on her relationships and to develop more realistic and compassionate perspectives.\n\nIn reflecting on this case, I am reminded of the intricate ways in which early developmental experiences and personality traits can manifest in seemingly unrelated areas of life. Sasha's journey is a testament to the complexity of human psychology, where physical symptoms can serve as powerful indicators of deeper emotional and psychological conflicts. It underscores the necessity for a holistic approach in therapy, one that considers the interplay of mind and body, as well as the individual's relational context.\n\nMoreover, Sasha's case reinforces the value of patience and persistence in therapy. Change, particularly when it involves deeply ingrained patterns, is often a gradual process. Sasha's willingness to engage with her discomfort and her courage to explore new ways of relating to herself and others were pivotal to her progress. As a clinician, witnessing her journey has deepened my appreciation for the resilience of the human spirit and the transformative potential of psychotherapy.\n\nIn conclusion, the case of Sasha offers rich insights into the nature of perfectionism and its impact on mental health. It highlights the importance of helping clients navigate the tension between striving for excellence and accepting imperfection. By fostering self-compassion and encouraging realistic self-expectations, therapy can empower individuals like Sasha to break free from the constraints of perfectionism, leading to a more authentic and fulfilling life. This case has undoubtedly enriched my understanding of anxiety and perfectionism, and it continues to inform my practice as I strive to support clients in their unique journeys toward healing and self-acceptance.", "causes": "Early childhood experiences (demanding) and physiological factors (abnormal bowel movements)", "symptoms": "Anxiety about bowel movements", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection;\nListening & Empathy: Building Relationships;\nFang Shuren Therapy: Exploring and understanding oneself through painting;\nSummary and outlook", "characteristics_of_illness": "Perfectionism as a result of an early upbringing environment", "treatment_effect": "Establishing a good relationship of counseling and trust,\nexpressing one's fears and thoughts, gaining a deeper understanding of one's stereotyped perception of oneself and making constructive   adjustments, in turn, improved interpersonal relationships and\npromoted self-acceptance"}

I have tried many methods to distract myself, to persuade myself, and to seek advice from friends, but nothing seems to work. I hope to resolve this issue and focus on my studies as I prepare for the exam.\n\n3. Information Observed by the Counselor: \n   The visitor spoke in a soft tone and exhibited a sense of powerlessness. He feels guilty about his harsh words towards his girlfriend and thinks he is letting down someone who loves him deeply. He described feelings of fear and anxiety about potentially losing his girlfriend, but he cannot control his emotions, leading to feelings of frustration and disappointment.\n\n4. Visitor's Main Issues and Patterns, and the Costs Incurred: \n   1. It is difficult for him to control thoughts about his girlfriend being with her ex-boyfriend; whenever these thoughts arise, he cannot concentrate on anything else. If his girlfriend is nearby, he constantly pressures her for answers, even saying hurtful things, which he describes as uncontrollable. He knows that this behavior harms their relationship, yet he can't help it until they have a big fight.\n   2. He remembers his parents frequently arguing during his childhood. One clear memory is of his mother being very strict with him, expecting excellent grades; if he had any minor slip-ups, he would be criticized and feel guilty, which planted the seed of perfectionism in him. The second memory is of arguments involving his father accusing his mother of infidelity, leading him to associate female infidelity with family discord and conflict.\n   3. His current girlfriend had relationships with other girls before him, and although they were all virgins, he still felt insecure and critical of them. He would express these criticisms as if they were for their own good, wanting them to improve, but this often led to arguments. Looking back, he sees that this pattern mirrors his mother's strict expectations for him to improve, which made him uncomfortable.\n\n5. Diagnosis: \n   The visitor's early experiences have instilled a perfectionism complex and the belief that female infidelity leads to conflict. With the pressure of the upcoming exam, deep-seated insecurities have surfaced, and he attributes these feelings to his virginity complex, believing that resolving it would eliminate his anxiety. However, the root of his anxiety stems from the pressure of the exam and the separation anxiety of being in different schools with his girlfriend afterward.\n\n6. Causes of the Issues: \n   - Biological Reasons: Poor sleep and a tendency to wake easily, which weaken his ability to handle stress. \n   - Social Reasons: Growing up in an environment where his parents frequently quarreled, lacking a harmonious model of gender relationships, resulting in an unstable family emotional system and unstable parental relationship. \n   - Psychological Reasons: The turmoil in his family environment has become a source of deep-seated insecurity for him, coupled with two triggers: his mother's perfectionist demands and his father's accusations about female fidelity, leading to an automatic association of insecurity with female infidelity and the formation of a virginity complex.\n\n7. Counseling Goals: \n   - Specific Goals: \n     1. Recognize that the source of stress is the upcoming exam and prioritize focusing on it, postponing discussions about emotional issues until after the exam.\n     2. Learn to confront his insecurities and change the way he expresses accusations and questioning.\n     3. Understand the origins of his emotions and learn to manage them without projecting them onto his girlfriend.\n     4. Build a new understanding and change the limited view of “virginity complex” as a measure of women's value.\n   - Final Goals: \n     1. Through exploring his family background, achieve self-improvement, change unhealthy beliefs and behaviors, and establish self-worth based on personal values rather than external factors.\n     2. Foster a positive development of the relationship through communication about inner needs and thoughts to resolve issues.\n     3. Develop a more comprehensive emotional processing mechanism, becoming more adaptable in relationships, and understanding that true goodness and beauty lie within.\n\n8. Counseling Effects: \n   - Cognition: The visitor realized that the virginity complex is just a symptom and not the root cause; the stress source must be addressed first. During counseling, I pointed out the origins of his virginity complex, and he recognized that it stems from insecurity brought on by his family background. He acknowledged that he has always had this complex, which was triggered by the exam's pressure.\n   - Behavior: Initially, he was very anxious and constantly pressured his girlfriend to resolve the virginity complex issue while hoping she would understand him. When she did not, he would get angry and criticize her. After three counseling sessions, these behaviors diminished, and he began to manage his emotions independently, apologizing to his girlfriend for losing control and expressing a need for solitude to process his feelings. \n   - Emotional Response: At the beginning of counseling, when he thought about his girlfriend not being a virgin, he would become agitated and angry. After three sessions, his anger transformed into guilt and remorse for lashing out at her. Through guided dialogues, he was able to identify that his anger towards his girlfriend stemmed from his mother's strict criticisms during his upbringing, leading to his perfectionist demands on her, which diminished his anger towards her.\n\n   Life Pattern: The visitor can now focus on preparing for his exam, rarely getting caught up in emotions, and has stopped obsessively discussing this issue with his girlfriend. He is managing his life more effectively. \n\n   Through counseling, I achieved this by: \n   1. Using the example of being chased by a tiger to help him understand that in stressful or dangerous situations, the instinct for self-preservation takes precedence, making it difficult to focus solely on emotional matters. The exam represents a stressful event, and discussing feelings of love in the context of that stress leads to misjudgments and expectations.\n   2. Using the example of Hong Kong's return to China, emphasizing that while Hong Kong is part of China, the transition took time and negotiation. Similarly, he and his girlfriend can set a mutual agreement to avoid discussing their pasts until after the exam, maintaining their relationship while allowing personal growth to address his virginity complex, and work towards a common goal.\n   3. Initially on the verge of breaking up, their relationship has actually improved, becoming more harmonious, allowing them to discuss studies and future plans rather than getting caught up in past relationships. \n\nDuring follow-up, the visitor reported that previously, when feeling emotional, he would want to confront his girlfriend, either to express anger or inquire about her past. Now, when he experiences emotions, he can reflect on whether they stem from early experiences or current events, allowing him to recognize interaction patterns in their relationship. His anger towards her has lessened quickly, as he can now see that his anger is rooted in his own vulnerabilities. When he feels the urge to ask about her past, he also hears a voice in his head reminding him that it would hurt her, preventing him from voicing that question.\n\nExcerpt from the dialogue with the visitor: \nCounselor: How long have you known your girlfriend? Did you know she wasn't a virgin when you met? \nVisitor: We’ve been together for three months, and I knew she wasn't a virgin when we met. \nCounselor: So why did you choose to be with her then if you didn't have such a strong virginity complex at the time? \nVisitor: I thought it was my own issue and I could handle it. \nCounselor: Has anything specific happened recently? \nVisitor: I’m preparing for the graduate entrance exam. My girlfriend is taking it for the second time, and this is my first attempt. \nCounselor: What does the exam mean for both of you? \nVisitor: I think the exam is quite important, so I want to resolve this virginity complex and focus on my studies. \nCounselor: The virginity complex likely isn't something you were born with; when do you think you developed this mindset? \nVisitor: I think it started when I was a child and my parents often argued, mainly about my father accusing my mother of similar issues. \nCounselor: How did you view your parents' arguments back then? Which side did you feel more aligned with emotionally? \nVisitor: I sided more with my mother. I thought my father was wrong; if he knew about my mother's issues, he shouldn't have married her. If they got married, he shouldn't bring it up again. This is also part of my current problem. I believe if I resolve my virginity complex, there won’t be issues between my girlfriend and me, and we won’t argue about it after marriage. \nCounselor: When do you find yourself thinking about these scenes more often? How do you feel when these thoughts arise? \nVisitor: It’s irregular, but now that I think about it, it often occurs when I feel afraid of losing her, during moments of anxiety about the future. \nCounselor: How did you handle those emotions back then? \nVisitor: I couldn’t control my emotions and would usually explode, pressuring her for answers. I was afraid to hear her response, yet I wanted to know. This would annoy her, leading to arguments. \nCounselor: Do you think this approach yields the results you desire? How does it make you feel? \nVisitor: No, it makes me feel even more scared and anxious because arguing harms our relationship, and she might bring up breaking up. That makes me even more fearful, and I also feel guilty, knowing I shouldn't act this way, but it’s already out there. That’s why I’m seeking help; I believe I can learn methods to cope on my own. \nCounselor: Have you experienced similar fear and anxiety in past intimate relationships? \nVisitor: (pauses to think) Yes, with my two previous girlfriends. I remember feeling fear and anxiety then, and they were both virgins. \nCounselor: It seems that uncertainty in relationships is what triggers your fear, rather than whether your girlfriend is a virgin. \nVisitor: I’m starting to understand the logic in these relationships. I should focus more on how to manage my relationship with my girlfriend. \nRuan Jian 2019.11.01"], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on this case has provided a rich tapestry of insights, not only into the client's particular struggles but also into the broader implications of how early life experiences can profoundly shape one's perceptions of relationships and self-worth. Initially, the issue presented as a virginity complex—a fixation on his girlfriend's past sexual experiences. However, as we delved deeper, it became clear that this was merely a surface manifestation of much more entrenched emotional and psychological issues.\n\nThe client, a 23-year-old student, found himself embroiled in a struggle between his emotions and rational desires, particularly in the context of an impending graduate entrance exam. His narrative was riddled with contradictions: an acknowledgment of his girlfriend's past, coupled with an intense emotional reaction to it. This complexity hints at the underlying psychological patterns rooted in his childhood experiences. His family background, marked by frequent parental discord, particularly his father's accusations of infidelity against his mother, seemed to have left an indelible mark on his psyche. These formative experiences likely ingrained a belief system wherein female infidelity was synonymous with family conflict and instability, thereby planting the seeds for his virginity complex.\n\nIt is critical to understand that the client’s virginity complex is not an isolated issue but a symptom of deeper-seated insecurities and perfectionism. The client’s upbringing in a household where his mother's strict expectations for excellence were paramount contributed to a perfectionist mindset. This perfectionism manifests not only in his academic pursuits but also in his relationships, where he subconsciously demands an idealized form of purity and loyalty. The client's internal struggle is compounded by societal pressures and personal expectations, creating a nexus of stress that significantly impacts his emotional well-being and relationships.\n\nAs we progressed through therapy, it became evident that the client's fixation on his girlfriend's past was a defense mechanism against his own vulnerabilities. By externalizing his insecurities and projecting them onto his girlfriend, he temporarily diverted attention away from his internal conflicts. This pattern of behavior aligns with the psychological concept of displacement, where emotions directed towards one person or situation are redirected towards another, often less threatening, target. Understanding this mechanism was pivotal in helping the client recognize that his distress was more about his internal landscape than his girlfriend's past.\n\nThe client's history of insecurity in relationships, even with previous partners who met his ideals of virginity, underscores that his fears are not rooted in objective reality but in subjective anxieties about inadequacy and abandonment. This realization was a turning point in therapy, allowing the client to shift focus from external blame to internal exploration. It became imperative to guide him towards understanding that the source of his anxiety was not his girlfriend's past but his own fears of not being enough—fears likely instilled by the high expectations set during his childhood.\n\nExploring the impact of the upcoming graduate exam on the client’s psyche was another crucial aspect of therapy. The exam represented more than an academic hurdle; it was a symbol of transition and uncertainty in both his personal and academic life. This impending change exacerbated his underlying insecurities, triggering his virginity complex as a distraction from the stress associated with the exam. Recognizing this allowed us to reframe the client's narrative, focusing on the exam as the primary stressor and encouraging him to compartmentalize his emotional issues until he could address them more effectively post-exam.\n\nThe therapeutic journey with this client also highlighted the importance of addressing perfectionism. His mother’s critical and demanding nature had instilled a belief that love and acceptance are contingent upon meeting certain standards. This belief translated into his relationships, where he projected these expectations onto his partners, leading to inevitable conflicts. By deconstructing this pattern, we worked towards helping the client develop a healthier self-concept, one where his worth is intrinsic and not dependent on external validation or control over his partner’s past.\n\nAdditionally, we employed the Gestalt Empty Chair Technique to facilitate an emotional dialogue between the client and his internalized voices of criticism and expectation. This exercise proved invaluable, allowing the client to confront and articulate the voices of his past—his mother’s perfectionism and his father’s mistrust—and to begin the process of reconciling these with his present self. Through this process, the client gained insight into the ways these internalized narratives influenced his perceptions and behaviors, enabling him to start dismantling their power over his current life.\n\nThe use of Solution-Focused Therapy was particularly effective in shifting the client’s focus from problems to solutions. By identifying moments when his virginity complex was less pronounced, we were able to amplify these instances, creating a repertoire of strategies to apply during moments of heightened anxiety. This solution-oriented approach not only empowered the client but also provided him with tangible tools to manage his emotions independently, fostering a sense of agency over his mental state.\n\nThrough psychoanalysis, we explored the deeper layers of the client’s psyche, unraveling the connections between his childhood experiences and his present concerns. This exploration revealed the role of unconscious processes in his emotional reactions, helping the client to understand the symbolic meaning behind his virginity complex. It was not merely about his girlfriend’s past but about control, fear of loss, and the need to uphold an idealized self-image—an image shaped by his early environment.\n\nUltimately, the therapeutic process aimed to help the client build a more comprehensive emotional processing mechanism, allowing for greater adaptability in relationships. By fostering an understanding that true worth lies within, independent of external circumstances or societal constructs, the client could begin to reconstruct his narrative from one of fear and inadequacy to one of self-acceptance and growth.\n\nIn conclusion, this case underscores the intricate interplay between early familial experiences, personal insecurities, and the manifestation of these in adult relationships. It highlights the necessity for therapists to look beyond presenting issues, recognizing them as symptoms of deeper psychological processes. By doing so, we can guide clients toward a more profound understanding of themselves, facilitating healing and personal development.

{"id": 9, "case_description": ["Xiaoxue, female, 16 years old, is currently in her second year of high school. Her father, Mr. Chen, is the owner of a trading company, and her mother, Ms. Huang, is the company's financial vice president. The family's economic conditions are relatively good. Last month, after Ms. Huang made an appointment with me, she met with Mr. Chen and their daughter, Xiaoxue. During their first meeting, Xiaoxue was dragged into the consultation room by her father, Mr. Chen, who was both scolding and pulling her along. Ms. Huang explained that since the age of 13, their daughter has often not returned home, or when she does, she locks herself in her room to go online. When her parents talk to her, she only responds perfunctorily. Her academic performance has seriously declined, and when her parents blame her for being disobedient, she often ends up shouting and arguing with Mr. Chen. There have been several instances where Mr. Chen has hit his disobedient daughter. Since then, Xiaoxue frequently skips classes with some classmates, has dyed her hair a yellow color, and dresses quite fashionably, with many holes in her pants. As a result, the class teacher often invites Mr. Chen and Ms. Huang to school for parent-teacher meetings, where the teachers criticize the parents for not cooperating to manage their child properly."], "consultation_process": ["Ms. Huang spent over 50 minutes carefully explaining to me many of Xiaoxue's bad habits and problems. During the discussion, Xiaoxue struggled a few times and wanted to leave, shouting and cursing, claiming she had no psychological issues and calling her parents insane for needing a psychologist. She also cursed at me, saying that so-called psychological counselors were just out to scam money. At that moment, Mr. Chen and his wife both had tears in their eyes, and they hurriedly apologized on behalf of their daughter, asking me not to be angry with her. Of course, as psychological counselors, how could we be angry at our patients? At that moment, I felt great sympathy for them as parents, and I was feeling quite heavy-hearted myself. I made a decision then and said to Xiaoxue, \"Xiaoxue, this is our first meeting today. Although we didn't know each other or communicate before, you could tell right away that I'm a fraudulent psychological counselor, which shows you're very wise. You cursed me well, and I thank you for that today; otherwise, I might have thought I was excellent. If you still want to curse, go ahead; I’ll give you five minutes to vent.\" At the same time, I asked Mr. Chen to let go of her hand so Xiaoxue could curse to her heart's content. Xiaoxue and Mr. Chen were both confused by my sudden action. Xiaoxue stood there, staring at me blankly without saying a word. I then asked Mr. Chen and Ms. Huang to step out to the waiting room, wanting to talk to Xiaoxue alone. After they left, Xiaoxue continued to stare at me, seemingly still processing the situation. I poured a cup of tea for her and asked her to sit down. I told Xiaoxue that her parents had been there before, and since she didn’t want to curse then, now that it was just the two of us, I encouraged her to express herself. Again, Xiaoxue seemed confused by my words. I noticed she inadvertently put her left finger to her mouth, clearly showing she was very nervous. I said again, \"Didn't you say I was a fraud? Why aren’t you talking now?\" Xiaoxue didn’t respond, and I also fell silent, observing her changes closely. We remained in silence for about two minutes until Xiaoxue suddenly looked at me and asked, \"Why did you want me to curse you? Is it because I hit the nail on the head? You psychologists don't prescribe medication or perform surgery like hospital doctors; you just talk to treat problems. Is psychological counseling really just a scam?\" At that moment, I felt a surge of happiness because she was finally speaking to me. I said, \"You say I’m a fraud; how interesting! I see your fashion is quite avant-garde; what do you like about that style?\" Xiaoxue started to relax and replied, \"You keep calling yourself a teacher. Since you thanked me for cursing you, call me teacher, and I’ll tell you.\" As soon as she finished speaking, I called her, \"Hello, teacher, nice to meet you,\" within about five seconds. Perhaps my sudden shift and addressing her as 'teacher' prompted Xiaoxue to run over and grab my hand, crying. I told her to let it out, to cry out all her grievances from the years. I handed her a tissue to wipe her tears. At that moment, Xiaoxue slowly began to tell me, \"My parents came here two days ago, and I heard from friends about you. Their parents said you have a very special treatment method, but I didn’t believe it. I didn’t want to come today; my dad forced me to come. I was planning to stay silent to see what you would do, so at first, I really hated you, thinking you were just someone my dad brought to scold me. I didn’t expect you would call me 'teacher' for my treatment.\" Xiaoxue said that for many years, I was the only one willing to communicate with her the way she wanted. When she said this, I turned my head away, tears welling up in my eyes because she finally shared her thoughts with me. My initial approach was worth it! After chatting with her for over two hours, I learned that her parents had always been busy with their careers and focused on the company, providing only material and financial satisfaction for Xiaoxue. Since childhood, she had been living with her grandmother, who took care of her. Her grandmother passed away two years ago, and she felt she had no support. She often woke up scared at night after dreaming about her grandmother. When she told her father about the dreams, he dismissed her as superstitious, ignoring that she was just a little girl who feared ghosts and spirits. This made her reluctant to stay home alone, so she often went out to play with classmates, leaving her with no mood to study. I discovered the root cause of all her issues. I communicated a lot with her and shared my own journey from a rural family to where I am today, telling her that her current conditions and environment were hundreds of times better than mine back then. I also discussed aspects of trust and the harsh realities of society, cultural differences, and the fact that no parents do not love their children, providing various examples, helping her recognize her previous misunderstandings toward her parents. We talked for nearly three hours, during which she cried several times. She said that after so many years, she was able to see herself and her parents anew. I then called her parents back in; they had been quietly listening outside the door. When Mr. Chen and Ms. Huang entered, they were both already in tears. I understood their tears were due to realizing they had neglected their child's feelings, feeling guilty and regretful for their shortcomings, and also crying because their child had spoken words of understanding for the first time in many years. They embraced and cried together for a long time; they needed to cry because it was the first time they felt happy tears after so many years. Xiaoxue voluntarily knelt down to ask her parents for forgiveness for her past mistakes, and she knelt before me, expressing gratitude for knowing me as her teacher. Later, once they calmed down, I proposed many points for improvement moving forward. The specifics are omitted."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on the transformative journey that Xiaoxue and her family underwent, I am filled with a profound sense of fulfillment and enlightenment. This case, though challenging at the outset, has reaffirmed my commitment to the field of psychotherapy and underscored the importance of empathy, patience, and unconventional approaches in achieving genuine healing and transformation.\n\nWhen Xiaoxue first entered my consultation room, her demeanor was defensive, her attitude rebellious, and her words laced with resentment. It was apparent that she had erected formidable barriers around herself, perhaps as a mechanism to shield against the emotional neglect she perceived from her parents. This perception of neglect was not due to a lack of love from her parents but rather a misalignment in the ways love and concern were expressed and received within the family unit. This highlights a critical aspect of adolescent personality development: the need for authentic connection and validation from caregivers, which, if unmet, can manifest in rebellious or defiant behaviors as seen in Xiaoxue.\n\nDuring our initial interaction, my decision to allow Xiaoxue the space to express her anger and frustration—by inviting her to curse at me—was a pivotal moment. This unconventional approach was not intended to provoke but rather to disarm her defenses and create a safe space where she felt seen and heard, perhaps for the first time in a long while. The act of calling her \"teacher\" was both a strategic and spontaneous decision. It was a gesture of respect and acknowledgment of her individuality and experiences, which in turn, catalyzed a profound emotional release.\n\nAs we delved deeper into Xiaoxue's narrative, it became evident that her rebellious behavior was symptomatic of deeper emotional distress and unresolved grief. The loss of her grandmother, who had been a primary caregiver and source of emotional security, left a void that her parents, preoccupied with their careers, had been unable to fill. This bereavement was compounded by a lack of understanding and support from her father, who dismissed her expressions of fear and loneliness. This scenario is not uncommon among adolescents who experience significant losses or changes in their support systems. It underscores the necessity for caregivers to be attuned to their children's emotional landscapes and to provide consistent emotional support, especially during formative years.\n\nOur sessions revealed a critical insight: Xiaoxue's defiance was a cry for attention and connection. Adolescents often resort to behaviors that might seem irrational or disruptive to adults, but these are frequently rooted in a need for acknowledgment and understanding. By reframing our interaction and allowing her to assume a role of authority, even momentarily, I was able to shift the dynamics of our relationship from adversarial to collaborative. This shift is crucial in therapeutic settings, particularly with adolescents, as it empowers them to take ownership of their narratives and healing processes.\n\nThe process of reconciliation with her parents was equally transformative. The tears shared between Xiaoxue and her parents during the session were not just expressions of guilt or regret but were also the beginnings of a new, more authentic dialogue. This case illustrates the importance of facilitating open communication within families. Many parents, like Mr. Chen and Ms. Huang, provide materially for their children, believing it suffices as an expression of love. However, emotional presence and active participation in a child's life are equally, if not more, critical. As Mr. Chen and Ms. Huang became more involved and attentive to Xiaoxue's needs, they began to rebuild the trust and connection that had been eroded over the years.\n\nThe transformation in Xiaoxue's behavior and outlook after just a few sessions was remarkable. She began to reintegrate into her family, both in terms of physical presence and emotional engagement. Her shift from a rebellious teenager to a responsible young adult who assists with household chores and prioritizes her education is a testament to the power of empathetic, patient, and personalized therapeutic interventions. This case reinforces the notion that adolescents are inherently resilient and capable of profound change when provided with the right support and understanding.\n\nReflecting on my role in this journey, I am reminded of the delicate balance therapists must maintain between guiding and empowering our clients. It is imperative to recognize the unique contexts and challenges each client faces and to adapt our approaches accordingly. In Xiaoxue's case, the key was to acknowledge her autonomy and to facilitate an environment where she felt empowered to explore her identity and emotions without judgment or coercion.\n\nThe journey with Xiaoxue and her family also highlighted the importance of viewing therapy as a collaborative process. It is not merely about providing solutions or advice but about co-creating a path toward healing and growth. This collaborative approach fosters a sense of agency in clients, enabling them to actively participate in their transformation.\n\nIn conclusion, this case has enriched my understanding of adolescent psychotherapy and reinforced my belief in the transformative potential of empathetic, patient-centered care. It has also served as a reminder of the profound impact a single word or gesture can have in opening channels of communication and healing. Xiaoxue's journey from rebellion to reconciliation is a powerful testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the capacity for change that lies within each of us. As therapists, our role is to illuminate these pathways to change, offering guidance, support, and, above all, unwavering belief in our clients' potential to heal and thrive.", "causes": "Upbringing (lack of companionship) and social factors (grandmother's death)", "symptoms": "Rebellious and abnormal behavior, staged problems in\nadolescent personality development", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection;\nHumanistic Therapy: Respect, sincerity, unconditional positive attention and empathy;\nListening and self-exposure", "characteristics_of_illness": "Personality development problems in adolescents", "treatment_effect": "Establish a good counseling relationship, guide the client to\nexpress his true inner thoughts and realize his current behavior\nproblems, establish a good balance in guidance and empowerment,\ngive full play to the client's autonomy and initiative, explore and\ndiscover new perspectives on the problem, and guide both parents\nand children to realize the conflict between the child's inner needs and the parents'only material support, as well as the importance of\nmeeting the psychological and companionship needs"}
{"id": 10, "case_description": ["Male, in his 30s, married. Experiencing a lack of self-worth, impaired social functioning, and a sense of hopelessness in life."], "consultation_process": ["On January 23, 2015, a visitor who claimed to be Ms. Zhang made a phone appointment for a consultation. She stated that her nephew (hereinafter referred to as Mr. He) is 33 years old, married, and has a 5-year-old son; he has been unwilling to go out or work at home for several years and does not take on family responsibilities. He often has some strange thoughts and rarely communicates with others; he claims to suffer from depression, which makes him reluctant to meet people and lacking in enthusiasm for life. After communication, her nephew expressed that he does not have any psychological problems and was unwilling to come for an in-person consultation. After repeated persuasion, he agreed to allow the consultant to visit him at home. The consultant informed her that home consultations are not conducive to the effectiveness of the consultation and do not align with the consultation framework, suggesting that she try to encourage her nephew to come to the studio for an in-person meeting. After multiple negotiations, her nephew finally agreed to come for a consultation, but only in the afternoon; otherwise, he would not attend. Since the consultant had appointments scheduled for the afternoon, she suggested whether it could be arranged for the evening, and after communication, it was agreed that he would come to the studio for a consultation at 8:30 PM.", "Around eight o'clock, Mr. He, along with his wife, son, and some relatives, arrived at the studio early. The consultant arrived at the studio at eight-thirty. Upon first impression, he appeared to express himself clearly, dressed neatly, with a calm demeanor and a slight smile, and he proactively shook hands with the consultant. Once alone in the consultation room, his first words were to thank the consultant for taking the time to see him, but he wanted to emphasize that he was forced to come by his family, that he had no psychological issues, and thus did not need counseling. After some simple relationship guidance, the conversation shifted to topics of cultural history, philosophical thought, and religious beliefs, where it became apparent that he had done considerable research and held some independent views (some of which were almost subversive to existing understandings). He described himself as a very confident person in his childhood, competitive by nature, and quick to learn anything he wanted to know; he did not feel bothered by the disparity in his current life or the material wealth of others, even harboring a sense of disdain. He was unwilling to attend gatherings with friends and family, feeling that no one understood him (no one reached his level). He recounted that he had previously excelled academically but became indulgent in high school, ultimately not finishing it. After entering society, he had taken on various jobs but felt they were not his strengths, which led to \"a lot of trauma,\" causing him to become reluctant to work and gradually lose enthusiasm for life. His interactions with his wife and child were minimal, and he hardly accompanied them on outings (even when he reluctantly went, he felt very tired). He had no regular eating habits, feeling indifferent about whether he ate or when. He used to enjoy playing basketball and was quite skilled, but he had not played much recently. (Analyzing that ball games require group support, he realized that being away from the group naturally led to no invitations to participate, and thus he gradually lost interest, which he acknowledged). Currently, his biggest hobbies are playing cards and smoking; he has lost a significant amount of money playing cards, feeling that his losses were not due to skill but rather a lack of self-control. He smokes two to three packs a day, feeling psychological discomfort without smoking but having no physical dependence (he insisted on not smoking in the consultation room until he couldn't resist and asked for the consultant's permission to smoke). He self-reported mild depression, lacking interest in many things and almost unable to imagine anything that could make him happy. Assessments confirmed a diagnosis of mild depression. Through guidance from the consultant, he recognized that his greatest pain was feeling unappreciated and that his personal value was not being realized. Although he did not fully agree with measuring value in monetary terms, the fact that he had not achieved even the value he defined for himself left him feeling somewhat despondent, though he did not always feel pain from it. He was unwilling to think deeply about life, believing that the current situation was quite good. He considered his mental state to be normal, with coherent thoughts, and did not see any issues, feeling that he did not need any psychological counseling.", "To avoid the consultation getting stuck, the counselor timely suggested a potential assessment, expressing great interest. To alleviate concerns, the counselor proposed that if the assessment was deemed inaccurate, there would be no charge, and the individual agreed to give it a try. A few minutes later, the potential assessment report was ready. The report indicated that the individual's mathematical logic, operational understanding, spatial imagination, and verbal memory abilities were strengths; particularly, the verbal memory ability reached over 18 points (the normal value is 6-8.99), with a quantitative score exceeding 54 (the normal value is 10-14). Conversely, organizational management, innovative communication, and emotional music abilities were identified as weaknesses. In terms of personality analysis, the report pointed out that the individual is competitive and has some ideas and behaviors that exceed those of the average person (specific details omitted). The individual quickly understood the assessment report and strongly agreed with the analysis. \n\nSpecific analysis: ① The individual's verbal memory ability is exceptionally strong, enabling good retention and personal understanding of various issues in literature, history, and philosophy. During their primary and secondary school years, they achieved good grades with minimal effort and were once known for their \"extensive knowledge and strong memory.\" They also found it difficult to forget many traumas, which contributed to mild depression. Additionally, Mrs. He reported that the individual could accurately remember a phone call with the counselor after just a glance. ② The individual has strong operational understanding, quickly learning sports that require movement breakdown and precision, as well as self-learning skills in computers and card games, believing themselves to be \"better than the average person.\" ③ Mathematical logic is a strength, leading to high sensitivity to numbers, strong logical analysis, reasoning, and debate skills. They feel that many people cannot keep up with their pace, resulting in reduced interpersonal communication, and they self-characterize as \"highly talented but unappreciated.\" ④ Spatial imagination is good, sometimes leading to impractical ideas, aligning with family perceptions of having \"many strange thoughts.\" They have a keen sense of direction and space, able to remember places and people after just one encounter. ⑤ Organizational management skills are weak, resulting in a basic inability to manage life affairs and weak self-control. Additionally, being the only boy among many sisters, they experienced excessive pampering from their parents during childhood (the counselor deduced this from current behaviors, which the individual acknowledged), leading to underdeveloped self-management skills and a lack of personal responsibility, which is the main reason their potential talents have not been discovered and their personal value has not been showcased. For example, despite performing well in school, they dropped out due to self-relaxation, even though they could achieve good grades with little studying. Their fondness for card games is not hindered by luck or skill but rather by a lack of self-control and the inability to stop in time. ⑥ Communication and innovation skills are weak, causing the individual to struggle to find breakthroughs in their dilemmas, opting instead to evade and give up (or continue to observe). Despite extensive research in literature, history, and philosophy, their output consists merely of integrating various theories without original creation (they have some ideas, but they lack a systematic approach) and have not written any original articles in this area. Interpersonal communication is minimal, with a lack of enthusiasm for communication; they have only a few friends but rarely contact them. ⑦ Musical emotional ability is weak, resulting in low sensitivity to emotions, characterized by emotional stability, often not revealing inner turmoil; they also react slowly to the emotions of those around them, with little interaction even among family members, giving an overall impression of detachment (this point was later confirmed by Mrs. He). \n\nOverall, the brain activity score was over 283 (the normal value is 100-168), indicating strong learning ability; many things can be learned quickly if the individual is willing. The left hemisphere is 13% more active than the right, far exceeding the reference value of 5%, showing excessive rationality with little emotional engagement, leading to a lack of passion and interest in life; communication with others often gets caught in self-referential thinking; thinking is highly associative, with rapid transitions; the thought process is complex, and concentration in tasks is insufficient.", "No one is a polymath; it is normal for intelligence to be distributed with strengths and weaknesses. The assessment report reveals that its intelligence level is not inferior to that of an average person, and in certain areas, it even possesses extraordinary talents. So what is preventing the realization of its potential, causing what could be a remarkably sharp weapon to lose its edge? A comprehensive analysis of its intelligence situation reveals two major bottlenecks that hinder the display of its talents: one is a relatively weak self-management ability; the other is a weak innovative thinking ability. Throughout its growth, there has been no emphasis on strengthening these areas. Before the age of 16, there was no focus on leveraging strengths to compensate for weaknesses, and after the age of 16, there was no effort to leverage strengths while avoiding weaknesses. It is like a vast army without a leader—full of talent but unable to find a breakthrough. No matter how great the innate potential, it cannot automatically translate into value. In fact, the better the talent, the deeper the pain of being unrecognized and the loneliness of high aspirations, which becomes a stumbling block to personal growth and progress.", "Since this is the first consultation, and given the time limitations inherent in psychological counseling, there has not yet been an in-depth discussion on how to improve. The preliminary suggestion is to recognize one's strengths and weaknesses, to play to one's strengths while avoiding weaknesses, starting from now and beginning with family. Increase emotional interactions, show more concern for the wife and children, and take on some family responsibilities. At the same time, consider how to integrate one's advantageous resources to gradually uncover their inherent value, and do not let capriciousness and avoidance ruin one's future. Any potential that is not developed or nurtured remains zero, just like a coal mine rich in resources; if it is not explored and tapped, it can only end up sleeping in desolation. He expressed strong agreement with the above analysis and felt deeply touched, requesting the counselor to print a copy for him to study carefully. Observations of details: 1. Before the consultation, his son came to the counseling room looking for his father, and rather than providing any comfort, he directly sent his son to find his mother. In the later part of the consultation, while communicating with his wife, he held his son in his arms. 2. The handshake before the consultation was purely formal, but at the end of the consultation, he deliberately shook hands with the counselor twice, expressing his gratitude sincerely and forcefully multiple times, and he hopes to return for another consultation next time.", "Consultation Reflection: The accumulation of psychological issues is often not a result of a single day’s hardship. While the current situation has its own reasons, improper family education cannot be excused either (according to family members, parental support has continued to this day). If parents could have been aware early on that their child's most needed areas for improvement were self-control and innovation abilities, and provided some necessary reinforcement training during childhood instead of indulging them excessively (indulgence often stifles a child's ability for self-management); if the child’s extraordinary potential could have been identified and valued early on, and reasonably developed under self-management; if their sense of value could have been fully manifested instead of enduring a continuous lack of it; if family members could have recognized the child's potential and personality traits early on and provided targeted encouragement and help instead of blindly offering financial support or criticism; if the child could have recognized their strengths and weaknesses early on, leveraging their strengths and avoiding weaknesses to plan their career and manage their life; perhaps Mr. He would not have reached this point today, but would instead be standing on a platform that better showcases his own value. Of course, at 33, life is still just beginning, and it is the best time for undertaking ventures and entrepreneurship. We hope that through this consultation, Mr. He can awaken to truly recognize and utilize his strengths and potential, using his sharpest tools to create a beautiful life of his own. We also hope that Mr. He’s family can provide him with the necessary understanding, tolerance, and support tailored to his intelligence and personality traits, helping him to emerge from the low point of his life, strengthen his inner power, and find his self-worth.", "A case that seemed impossible at the beginning was successfully completed, achieving initial results and helping the client identify the root of their problems, which could be considered a successful consultation. However, the consultant felt a heavy weight in their heart. Why would a young person with excellent learning abilities and strong language memory gradually lose the courage to take responsibility, face the pain of a lack of values, and approach the edge of self-abandonment, risking disconnection from society? This situation deserves reflection from each of us. We should also consider whether our own children exhibit the same tendency of \"not focusing on discovering their strengths while inadvertently amplifying their weaknesses.\" It is important to recognize the value of identifying a child's potential characteristics early on and helping them \"find the right direction and avoid detours,\" tailoring education to their abilities and fostering them positively, in order to prevent their limitless potential from becoming a barren coal mine. (All personal information in the text has been anonymized; names other than the consultant's are pseudonyms.)", "Ruoshui Sanqian Work QQ: 1163169478; Phone/WeChat: 18922919960.", "If you reprint this original article by Ruoshui Sanqian, please indicate the source."], "experience_and_reflection": "The case of Mr. He is a poignant illustration of how early childhood experiences and familial dynamics can have a profound impact on an individual's psychological development. This case, while initially challenging, provided valuable insights into the intricate layers that constitute a person's self-worth and identity. As I reflect on this consultation, I am reminded that the accumulation of psychological issues does not occur overnight. Rather, it is a gradual process influenced by a myriad of factors, including family upbringing, societal expectations, and personal experiences.\n\nFrom the onset, Mr. He's reluctance to acknowledge his psychological distress was evident. His insistence on not needing counseling, despite clear symptoms of depression, highlights a common challenge in psychotherapy: the resistance to confront one's vulnerabilities. This resistance often stems from a fear of acknowledging perceived weaknesses, which can be exacerbated by a lack of supportive structures during one's formative years. In Mr. He's case, his family's continuous support—though well-intentioned—appears to have contributed to an overindulgence that stifled his ability to develop self-management skills and innovative thinking.\n\nThe consultation revealed several key aspects of Mr. He's cognitive abilities. His exceptional verbal memory and strong operational understanding are notable strengths that could serve as powerful tools for personal and professional growth. However, these strengths have been overshadowed by his weak organizational management skills and limited capacity for innovative communication. This imbalance suggests a developmental gap where Mr. He's potential has not been adequately harnessed, leading to a sense of unfulfillment and stagnation.\n\nIt's crucial to consider the role of family dynamics in shaping Mr. He's psychological landscape. Growing up as the only male among several sisters, Mr. He experienced a level of pampering that, while nurturing, may have inadvertently hindered his development of self-sufficiency. The familial emphasis on financial support rather than emotional engagement and encouragement likely contributed to his current state of disengagement. This pattern reflects a broader societal tendency to equate financial provision with successful parenting, overlooking the importance of emotional and psychological nurturing.\n\nFurthermore, Mr. He's self-reported mild depression and lack of enthusiasm for life are indicative of deeper existential struggles. His high sensitivity to numbers and strong logical reasoning abilities have not been translated into meaningful interpersonal connections or career advancements. This disconnect between potential and realization underscores the need for a holistic approach to therapy—one that addresses both cognitive strengths and emotional vulnerabilities.\n\nThe assessment highlighted Mr. He's competitive nature and his propensity for subversive thinking. These traits, while indicative of a sharp intellect, have led to a sense of isolation and superiority that hampers his ability to engage meaningfully with others. The challenge lies in guiding Mr. He to leverage these traits in a constructive manner, fostering a sense of community and shared understanding rather than alienation.\n\nReflecting on the consultation process, it is clear that the journey toward self-actualization is multifaceted. For Mr. He, recognizing his strengths and weaknesses is only the first step. The real challenge lies in integrating these insights into actionable strategies that enhance his self-worth and interpersonal relationships. Encouraging emotional interactions with his family and taking on responsibilities at home are practical steps toward this goal. Additionally, exploring avenues to apply his cognitive strengths—such as verbal memory and mathematical logic—can help uncover his inherent value and contribute to a renewed sense of purpose.\n\nThe notion of potential as a \"barren coal mine\" serves as a powerful metaphor for untapped resources and unfulfilled aspirations. Just as a coal mine requires exploration and extraction to yield its riches, so too must Mr. He's potential be nurtured and developed. This requires a conscious effort to balance rationality with emotional engagement, fostering a holistic sense of self that is both intellectually and emotionally fulfilling.\n\nAs a clinician, this case serves as a reminder of the importance of early intervention and tailored educational approaches. Had Mr. He's family recognized and nurtured his strengths and weaknesses earlier, the trajectory of his life might have been different. This insight extends beyond Mr. He's personal experience, urging us to consider how we educate and support our children to avoid similar pitfalls.\n\nIn conclusion, Mr. He's journey is a testament to the complexities of human development and the critical role of psychotherapy in facilitating personal growth. While the road to self-discovery is fraught with challenges, it is also replete with opportunities for transformation. Through continued support and introspection, Mr. He has the potential to emerge from his current state of despondency and embrace a future that reflects his true capabilities and aspirations. As he navigates this path, the understanding and encouragement of his family will be pivotal in helping him realize his self-worth and create a life of fulfillment and meaning.", "causes": "Early parenting experiences (doting, lack of self-\nawareness) and social factors (lack of interpersonal support)", "symptoms": "Mild depression, impaired social functioning, low self-\nworth, feelings of hopelessness", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection;\nStrengths assessment: Strengths and weaknesses are\nhighlighted, but strengths have not yet been brought into play;\nCognitive therapy: adjusting the perception of one's\nstrengths and weaknesses and making appropriate behavioral changes;", "characteristics_of_illness": "The sense of meaninglessness and isolation that comes with untapped strengths and potentials", "treatment_effect": "Establish a good relationship with the client, help the client to\nrealize the potential of his own stubbornness and the shortcomings that hinder his development, and lay a good foundation for further\ndevelopment of behavioral strategies to promote strengths and avoid\nweaknesses"}
{"id": 11, "case_description": ["Children are the future of a country and the hope of every family. Parents spare no effort in nurturing their children, as the desire for their sons to succeed and their daughters to thrive has taken root in the hearts of every pair of parents and even every family member. This is especially true in families where the only child is predominant; these families, centered around the child and with the child's growth trajectory as the radius of their activities, represent the main pattern of social family life.", "In such a social and educational environment, pampering has become a common issue in how most families treat their children. It seems that except for studies, which cannot be replaced, everything else is managed by parents or both sides of the family. Aside from maintaining a slight insistence on academics, almost all other aspects are allowed to develop recklessly, leading to capricious behavior from the children. The so-called \"little devils\" and \"children who become less sensible as they grow up\" are mostly \"cultivated\" in such family environments. Pampering is characterized by unlimited tolerance and unconditional compromise, and the most notable traits of these children are selfishness and disregard for rules. They are self-centered in everything, expecting others to unconditionally accommodate their ideas, often accompanied by their own set of twisted logic and fallacies. When they are young, they remain oblivious to this as their parents \"shield\" them. However, once they face situations requiring independence, and their parents can no longer step in to resolve issues, their world often collapses completely. They then choose to retreat into their comfort zone at home, refusing to engage with people and matters outside. Only at such times do these parents often start to pay attention, frantically \"seeking remedies,\" and even going so far as to claim that they are willing to spend any amount of money to solve their child's problems.", "In the consulting cases related to children's issues that I have encountered, such situations are the majority. Xiao Yu, a boy who just started middle school, is a representative case among these types. I hope that sharing this case can provide some awareness for similar parents and inspire all parents in the process of nurturing and educating their children.", "Fifteen-year-old Xiaoyu just started middle school this year. His dad is developing his career in another city, and he has been taken care of by his mom. Perhaps because his dad is not often around, his mom dotes on him particularly. When Xiaoyu was born, he grew up with his mom at his grandmother's house, where both his mom and grandmother's family loved and cared for him very much, indulging him in everything, giving him whatever he wanted. His dad, who rarely came home just a few times a year, also catered to his every need, and like most families, was only strict with him when it came to his studies.", "Under the careful care of his family, Xiao Yu grew up healthy and reached the age of 5. However, his family gradually noticed that he had some symptoms of hyperactivity. In kindergarten, it was difficult for him to stay focused and quietly listen to the teacher like other children. As he grew older, this manifested in his learning results, and his academic performance increasingly lagged behind. To address this, his parents took him for extra tutoring after class, but there were still no noticeable results.", "Medical research indicates that there are various reasons for the manifestations of ADHD in children. In addition to genetic and physiological factors, excessive pampering is also a cause of ADHD. Children who grow up without any constraints tend to indulge in their natural tendencies, making it increasingly difficult for them to maintain focus over time. As we know, maintaining focus is a result of self-discipline in both thought and physical behavior. The longer one maintains focus, the more fatigue sets in once relaxation occurs. Focus is a habit developed under certain conditions, influenced by both internal and external factors, formed consciously and unconsciously, resulting from both self-discipline and external pressure. In other words, the ability to focus also needs to be cultivated.", "A growing environment like that of Xiao Yu, where parents meticulously provide an \"all green lights\" upbringing, easily leads to a lack of resilience against \"storms.\" In his world of thought, his journey has always been smooth sailing, and the world appears beautiful to him. Once he steps out of this special comfort zone of family, all real-world environments will feel alien to him, leaving him at a loss and struggling to adapt. This is also a significant factor contributing to his hyperactivity at the age of five when he needs to start school. He completely lacks the self-discipline required for learning and the ability to handle the pressure that comes from focused thinking, expressing his discomfort through hyperactive behaviors, which over time has become a chronic issue.", "The result of not being able to \"treat the symptoms\" is that, although his family took him to various doctors, there was no improvement. Instead, as he grew older, his aversion to studying increased, eventually culminating in a complete refusal to go to school during middle school. He clung to the comfort of his home, coming up with various excuses to make his family accept his ideas, while they were extremely anxious yet at a loss for what to do."], "consultation_process": ["The first time I met Xiaoyu was when he came with his parents and an old gentleman who was said to be his maternal grandfather. In this unfamiliar setting, he seemed quite obedient, quietly sitting in the place arranged for him while listening to his parents explain the reasons why he couldn't go to school at that time. (His father had to temporarily set aside his career to take him around seeking help since the child could no longer attend school normally.)", "The reason his parents can accept his decision to drop out of school, as described by his father, is that he feels dizzy as soon as he sees a book. Even if he forces himself to study, he cannot absorb anything. If he listens to the teacher for too long, he develops a severe headache, and in more severe cases, he furrows his brow, rolls his eyes, and shakes his head.", "What does a 15-year-old child do when he drops out of school? When I asked about his current situation, his father mentioned this: Xiaoyu has become obsessed with mountain biking. As long as he is in contact with it, he shows incredible excitement, riding for as long as he wants without getting tired, and he can take apart a relatively complex mountain bike and reassemble it, working all day without complaining of fatigue.", "When I requested to communicate with the child alone, the \"grandfather\" who had been silent all along spoke up, asking to stay and listen. At first, I was puzzled about the relationship between this elderly gentleman and Xiaoyu, considering that he was not a direct relative and that both of Xiaoyu's parents were present; I wondered why they had brought him such a long distance. During the subsequent treatment, the excessive suggestions from this elderly gentleman about my treatment process led to interventions that made me feel compelled to \"be serious\" with him, which resulted in some unpleasantness. Later, I learned from Xiaoyu about the true identity of this \"grandfather.\"", "This old gentleman is not a distant relative, but one of the countless tutors that Xiaoyu has gone through, who volunteered to help Xiaoyu's parents solve their child's problems. After some time, when Xiaoyu's parents felt there was no change, they traveled a long distance to my studio. This old gentleman insisted on getting to the bottom of the matter, so he asked his parents to conceal his identity and come along.", "The old gentleman initially told me that the child had claustrophobia. I asked him how he came to that conclusion, and he confidently replied that he had read many books on psychology and was quite knowledgeable in the field. Moreover, he had been in contact with Xiaoyu for a long time; at first, Xiaoyu wouldn’t speak to anyone, but now he was willing to communicate and even actively cooperated with his parents to seek medical advice, all thanks to his long-standing efforts. Although the information I gathered from my interactions was quite different from his, considering the old gentleman's age and enthusiasm, I maintained a supportive attitude. Unexpectedly, this supportive attitude became an excuse for him to guide and question my treatment plan. He insisted on being present throughout the entire treatment process, which I could no longer tolerate. Leaving aside other factors, from a treatment perspective, having others present is not conducive to therapy. I had to remind him: if you have doubts about me, and if you are confident in resolving the child’s issues, you can fully persuade Xiaoyu's parents to let you take complete responsibility. However, if you want to receive treatment here, please respect my requirements; the treatment must be conducted without anyone else present.", "The fact is that Xiao Yu does not have the phobia as the old man described; the simple issue is a dislike for studying. The so-called anxiety is merely the inability to bear the social and familial pressures stemming from resisting learning. After becoming familiar with him and earning his trust, Xiao Yu gradually opened up to me, revealing aspects that both shocked me and led me into deep reflection and concern: the education of children is a long and arduous journey, and incorrect guidance and improper methods can very likely ruin a child's life, especially in terms of family education.", "After spending some time with Xiaoyu and communicating with him, along with the help of hypnosis, he has relaxed a lot and is very willing to accept my help. His entire growth trajectory and psychological process have gradually become clearer. All his thoughts are very simple, aligning with a child's emotional journey, far from the complex conclusions drawn under the pressure of adulthood.", "In Xiaoyu's memory, his family was very protective of him, and he had little opportunity to interact and play with other children. Before going to kindergarten, he was almost like a flower in a greenhouse, with everyone around him being very accommodating. Once he started kindergarten, he felt a severe sense of discomfort; he couldn't tolerate sitting still and listening to the teacher for long periods. He had thought about resisting, but gradually he realized that not studying properly was something his family would never agree to. They were very strict with him regarding this matter, with no room for compromise. Helplessly, he could only comply with his family's demands, studying day after day at school, but he could never focus on his studies. Outside of school, his parents forced him to attend extra classes, and his academic performance was consistently poor. He often displayed restless and undisciplined behavior and struggled to fit in with his peers, which made him increasingly unhappy and strengthened his desire to avoid school.", "His family was anxious and took Xiao Yu to seek medical help everywhere. He himself was confused and could only let his family arrange everything. During this period, he also took anti-anxiety medication for over a year, and he became quite numb, but his aversion to studying never wavered.", "In the voice of Xiaoyu's family, Xiaoyu's current condition is such that as soon as he sits in the classroom, he feels dizzy; if it doesn't stop, he suffers from severe headaches. This reason has finally allowed his family to accept his decision to take a break from school, but it has not interrupted his hope of returning to campus, leading him into a long and heartbreakingly difficult journey of seeking medical help.", "My communication with Xiaoyu has been smooth, but there is one thing that makes me a bit suspicious. As soon as I mention his studies, he yawns continuously and appears listless. At first, I thought it might be a symptom from medication, but later I found that as long as I don't bring up the topic of studying, he can maintain a lively spirit. After careful observation and testing, I discovered his inner \"calculations.\"", "I asked Xiaoyu, \"Why don't you feel tired when riding or assembling a mountain bike, and why don't you get dizzy or have a headache?\"", "\"Because I like it!\" Xiaoyu answered without hesitation.", "\"You don't want to do things you dislike, so you come up with excuses like headaches and dizziness, and that way your family will agree to let you skip school, right? On one hand, you don't want to go against your family's wishes, but on the other hand, you really don't want to study, so you think that only such excuses will convince your family to allow you to take a break from school.\"", "Perhaps because I hit the nail on the head, Xiaoyu subconsciously lowered his head and murmured, \"Teacher, how did you know?\"", "\"It's easy to judge this: if you can seriously disassemble and reassemble a mountain bike, it shows that you have the ability to focus and can concentrate on it for a long time without any discomfort. Assembling a bike is also a way of learning. Because you are interested in it, you don't feel tired; instead, it brings you joy!\"", "Xiao Yu stopped talking and felt even more embarrassed to look at me.", "\"No child is born loving to learn, just as you may not like reading. Children who enjoy learning do so because the process brings them happiness, such as improved abilities, praise from family, compliments from teachers, and appreciation from classmates, all of which motivate them to learn. More importantly, the pressure from your family to study comes from the fact that everyone needs to acquire certain skills through learning in order to meet the requirements for independent living when they grow up. Hasn't your family ever told you that if you don't study now, you won't be able to do anything in the future? What will you do when you grow up?\" Taking the opportunity while Xiao Yu was listening attentively, I added this promptly.", "\"Everyone at home tells me about the importance of studying, and I know it's necessary, but I just can't focus on it,\" Xiaoyu said helplessly. \"I've already learned how to assemble mountain bikes, so I can support myself in the future.\"", "\"Who is providing you with such an opportunity? Your family doesn't even produce mountain bikes. Products are becoming more and more technologically advanced, and factories are hiring people who are educated. You haven't even finished middle school; do you think there will be an opportunity?\"", "Upon hearing what I said, Xiaoyu fell silent.", "\"In fact, as long as you persist in doing anything, you will find your own joy and preferred way within it.\" For Xiaoyu, there has been too much preaching, which won't have much effect; it must be combined with specific matters to truly touch his heart and feelings. \"Hiding in an air-conditioned room every day in the summer is not good for your health. Tomorrow, I will take you to the natural reservoir to swim.\" I said directly without asking Xiaoyu's opinion.", "Seeing that Xiaoyu was a bit hesitant, he finally nodded in agreement.", "In the midsummer season, the natural reservoir has attracted a lot of popularity. At first, Xiaoyu felt a bit restrained and uncomfortable, but when he saw many younger children joyfully playing in the reservoir, he was completely inspired and quickly blended into their cheerful atmosphere.", "I continually encourage him to increase the distance of his swimming, consciously training him to persevere in a state of fatigue, so that he can feel the joy of persistence far outweighing the physical tiredness.", "I'm sorry, but it seems that there is no text provided for translation. Please provide the Chinese text you would like me to translate.", "Through various forms of training, along with hypnosis therapy during the process, Xiao Yu gradually realized that there are many things that can make him happy and that he is willing to do. The more he puts in, the more he gains, and he can also accept some pressure and obstacles that arise during the process. He has become more proactive. What reassures me even more is that his understanding is changing little by little; he no longer resists things that are difficult for him.", "About a week later, his parents excitedly told me, \"This child has changed. Last night, he actually took the initiative to ask for a study plan and plans to return to school when the term starts.\"", "I can understand the excitement of parents at this moment, but I still have some concerns about whether they can competently guide and assist their child alone, helping him to enter the necessary path of normal growth.", "Fortunately, during this time, his parents have also undergone significant changes, diligently implementing my suggestions and their own expectations, so the old gentleman no longer has doubts about me. All of this is based on the areas they can see or most hope to change. (Sometimes I feel that being a psychologist is really tiring; it not only requires changing the patient themselves but also changing the thoughts of those around them.)", "Because they saw their child changing in the way they hoped, Xiao Yu's parents kept my requests for their attention in mind, fearing that they might not do it well in the future. They repeatedly asked me to provide them with a written form to firmly refer to throughout the process.", "As I watched their happy figures leaving, I let out a long sigh of relief! May everything be well in the world of love!"], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting deeply on the case of Xiaoyu and the broader implications of such scenarios has reinforced my understanding of the critical role family dynamics play in child development. The Chinese proverb, \"It takes ten years to grow trees, but a hundred years to cultivate people,\" aptly underscores the long and intricate journey of nurturing a child. This case has illuminated several nuanced insights into how early familial interactions can profoundly influence a child's psychological and behavioral patterns, shaping their future.\n\nXiaoyu's journey is a testament to the challenges faced by children raised in environments where pampering and overindulgence are prevalent. This case has made me acutely aware of the delicate balance required in parenting; one where love and support must be measured with discipline and opportunities for independence. Overindulgence, as seen in Xiaoyu's upbringing, can create a superficial sense of security and confidence in children. However, this is akin to building a house on a shaky foundation. When children are shielded from adversity, they may lack the resilience needed to face real-world challenges. This creates a fragile self-esteem, easily shattered when they encounter situations beyond their protected environments.\n\nIn Xiaoyu's case, his family's well-intentioned yet misguided approach to parenting led to a lack of self-discipline and focus, manifesting as an aversion to academic pursuits. The symptoms of hyperactivity and anxiety, often mistakenly attributed solely to physiological or genetic causes, can also be significantly influenced by the child's upbringing. Xiaoyu's inability to concentrate and his withdrawal from school were not merely issues of attention deficit but rather symptomatic of deeper, underlying psychological discomfort and misalignment with his environment.\n\nThe therapeutic journey with Xiaoyu highlighted the importance of understanding the child's perspective. His fixation on mountain biking revealed a fundamental truth: motivation and interest are powerful drivers of focus and engagement. This realization was pivotal in redirecting his energy towards productive pursuits. By acknowledging his passions and channeling them into structured activities, Xiaoyu began to experience the satisfaction of achieving goals through perseverance and effort. This shift in perspective was facilitated by hypnotherapy, which allowed him to access and process subconscious beliefs and attitudes, fostering a more adaptive mindset.\n\nMoreover, this case underscored the critical role of the therapist in navigating family dynamics. The presence of the old gentleman, initially perceived as a supportive figure, eventually emerged as a challenge to the therapeutic process. His interventions, though well-intentioned, were indicative of a broader societal tendency to impose preconceived notions on a child's behavior without fully understanding the individual's unique context. This experience reinforced the necessity for therapists to assert the integrity of the therapeutic space, ensuring that external influences do not undermine the process.\n\nThrough working with Xiaoyu, I gained a deeper appreciation for the transformative power of therapy not only on the child but also on the family system. Educating and involving parents in the therapeutic process is crucial. Xiaoyu's parents, initially overwhelmed by their son's struggles, learned to adapt their parenting strategies, becoming active participants in his journey towards resilience and autonomy. This transformation was facilitated by consistent communication and the provision of clear, actionable guidance, emphasizing the importance of a collaborative therapeutic alliance.\n\nThe case also prompted reflection on broader societal issues related to education and parenting. The pressure to conform to academic standards, often at the expense of a child's mental health and well-being, is a pervasive issue. Xiaoyu's initial aversion to studying was not a rejection of learning per se but a response to the overwhelming pressure and lack of alignment with his personal interests and capabilities. This highlights the need for educational systems and parents to recognize and nurture diverse talents and learning styles, fostering environments where children can thrive.\n\nIn conclusion, the case of Xiaoyu serves as a powerful reminder of the profound impact of early familial interactions on a child's development. It emphasizes the necessity for a balanced approach to parenting, where love and discipline coexist harmoniously.

The cases of Zhang, Li, Wang, and Sun illustrate a spectrum of psychological difficulties that are not only common but also deeply impactful on the lives of adolescents. In understanding these issues, we can glean crucial insights into the nature of adolescent development and the role of supportive interventions.\n\nFirstly, the sense of loneliness experienced by students like Zhang is a profound emotional state that stems from a confluence of factors. The shift to a new environment, characterized by unfamiliar peers and teachers, often leaves students feeling isolated. Zhang's case underscores the necessity of understanding how social dynamics within a high school setting can exacerbate feelings of loneliness. Her perception of prejudice from roommates and the absence of close friendships reveal the importance of fostering inclusive social networks and peer support systems in educational institutions. Socialization opportunities through structured activities can be instrumental in mitigating these feelings. As practitioners, we must encourage schools to facilitate environments where students can form meaningful connections. Meanwhile, parents play a critical role by gradually encouraging independence while providing emotional support, ensuring that their children do not feel abandoned during this pivotal transition.\n\nLi's experience of frustration due to academic challenges highlights another dimension of the high school transition. The increased academic demands and a shift from guided learning to self-directed study can be overwhelming for students who were previously high achievers. Li's insistence on transferring schools and the resulting tension with his parents illustrate the potential for academic pressure to affect familial relationships. This case draws attention to the need for educators to smooth the academic transition by aligning middle school and high school curricula and teaching strategies. Furthermore, students should be equipped with metacognitive strategies to enhance their learning processes, empowering them to adapt to new academic expectations. Parents, on their part, should approach academic concerns with empathy, recognizing the psychological impact of academic setbacks and working collaboratively with educators to support their children.\n\nThe case of Wang introduces the complex issue of adolescent indulgence and rebellion. Wang's defiance of parental authority and school rules points to a deeper struggle for autonomy and identity. This behavior often emerges from a combination of developmental factors and family dynamics. Adolescents naturally seek to assert their independence, and when faced with overly strict or permissive parenting, they may react by pushing boundaries. It is crucial for parents to find a balanced approach to discipline, fostering open communication while setting reasonable boundaries. Educators, too, must be adept at channeling students' desires for independence into positive directions, perhaps by engaging them in leadership roles or creative projects that allow for self-expression within a structured framework. Students like Wang need guidance to understand the implications of their actions and develop a respect for communal norms while still feeling a sense of personal freedom.\n\nSun's struggle with an inferiority complex sheds light on the impact of self-perception and societal pressures on adolescent mental health. Her acute self-consciousness about physical appearance and subsequent withdrawal from social interactions reveal the damaging effects of negative self-image. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to developing low self-esteem due to physical changes during puberty and heightened sensitivity to peer perceptions. Sun's case illustrates the importance of fostering a supportive environment where students feel valued for their intrinsic qualities rather than superficial attributes. Educators and parents should work together to promote positive self-concept and resilience, emphasizing strengths and achievements. Therapeutic interventions can also play a role in helping students like Sun reframe their self-perceptions and build self-confidence through gradual exposure to social situations in a controlled and supportive manner.\n\nIn reflecting on these cases, it becomes apparent that the psychological challenges faced by first-year high school students are multifaceted and interrelated. Each case presents unique insights into how these challenges manifest and affect the lives of adolescents. As clinicians, it is imperative to adopt a holistic approach that considers the interplay of individual, familial, and educational factors in addressing these issues. Schools should be seen not just as places of academic learning but as environments that support the overall well-being of students. This involves creating a culture of openness and support where students feel safe to express their concerns and seek help.\n\nMoreover, the role of parents cannot be overstated. As primary caregivers, they are instrumental in shaping their children's attitudes towards challenges and setbacks. Encouraging open dialogue, providing reassurance, and modeling adaptive coping strategies are essential components of effective parental support. Parents should be educated about the developmental needs of adolescents and equipped with strategies to help their children navigate this critical stage.\n\nFrom a clinical perspective, it is also important to recognize the potential for early intervention to prevent the escalation of psychological issues. Regular screening and assessment of students' mental health can help identify those at risk and facilitate timely support. Collaborative efforts between school counselors, teachers, and mental health professionals can ensure a comprehensive support system is in place, addressing both academic and emotional needs.\n\nUltimately, the goal is to empower students to develop resilience and adaptability in the face of challenges. By fostering a supportive and understanding environment, both at home and in school, we can help students build the skills necessary to thrive not only in high school but in their future endeavors. As we reflect on these experiences, it is clear that addressing the psychological needs of first-year high school students is not only beneficial for their academic success but is also crucial for their overall development and well-being.", "causes": "Personal personality factors (early upbringing experience), social factors (interpersonal support and school transition),\nand educational factors", "symptoms": "School boredom in adolescents (loneliness, frustration, low self-esteem, indulgence)", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection;\nMetacognitive psychological intervention techniques: the three parties of home, school and society adopt constructive strategies to educate people collaboratively, for schools,\nextracurricular activities can be set up to enhance emotional\ncommunication between students, for parents, mainly to\nprovide understanding and encouragement for adolescents, for psychological professionals, appropriate assessment,\npsychological education and guidance can be carried out, and the three work together to build a social support system for\nadolescents, improve their resilience and adaptability, and help them make a smooth transition from junior high school to high  school;", "characteristics_of_illness": "Staged disorders in adolescent development", "treatment_effect": "It satisfies adolescents' need for autonomy and belonging,\nreduces the appearance of rebellious behavior, and improves well- being, resilience and adaptability."}
{"id": 13, "case_description": ["A 49-year-old woman has always been puzzled about why her sister is consistently unfriendly towards her. She finds it hard to accept the reasons behind her sister's attitude. Therefore, she used OH cards to reveal the personality differences between herself and her sister, and then explored her childhood experiences through hypnosis. She rediscovered her inner strength and became happier."], "consultation_process": ["Part One: Collecting Information A 49-year-old woman has always struggled to understand why her sister is consistently unfriendly to her. She has worked hard and treated her sister well, providing significant financial support. Over time, her sister's life improved, and she offered her some help in return. However, emotionally, her sister has always been sarcastic and indifferent, even when the woman faced marital issues. It's difficult for her to accept why her sister has such an attitude towards her. She drew cards: Card 1 and Card 2. Card 1 represents herself; she described herself as simple and not good at dressing up, loving to learn, and eager to help others, with straightforward thoughts. Card 2 represents her sister; she is beautiful, attentive to her appearance, and has a good sense of aesthetics. From a positive perspective, her sister seems aloof and tall, truly beautiful, but somewhat closed off from the outside world, preferring to showcase her beauty rather than connect with others. In contrast, although she does not consider herself particularly attractive, she is relatively happy due to her ability to find joy in herself and her curiosity about the world. She feels confused due to the limited harmonious moments they shared throughout their lives, prompting her to explore further. Next, she drew partner cards to examine their relationship, drawing Cards 3 and 4. She said Card 3 resembled her sister, who is beautiful and feminine. Her sister criticizes her, and she feels dumbfounded and somewhat masculine, unsure of how to respond, which leaves her in a bad mood. Whenever her sister gets angry, her words come out like a rapid-fire barrage, but none of the issues get resolved. Card 4, she said, indicates stopping. Stopping means halting the endless arguments and perhaps exploring other solutions.\n\nPart Two: Hypnosis Exploration of Growth Space I guided her to relax and see her growth timeline. Since she had previously done OH card exploration and established a good trust relationship with me, she quickly visualized her timeline. She described it as follows: \"My timeline has the past on the left and the future on the right. Overall, the past is gray, lacking brightness and warmth, while the future is bright, warm, and comfortable like spring sunshine. Both ends of the past and future are trumpet-shaped.\" I encouraged her to walk back along the timeline to her childhood and see what scenes she could find. She described it as misty, like a white fog, unclear. I suggested she stretch the timeline, making it larger to observe closely. Following my instructions, she said, \"I see the white fog disappearing, revealing something like a black mountain.\" I said, \"Use your subconscious to clear them away.\" She employed her subconscious wisdom to do so. I asked her to feel her body and how it felt. She responded, \"The heaviness is much better, and it doesn't feel so cold anymore, but there's still some discomfort.\" I encouraged her to continue exploring and see what else she could find. After a while, her body began to tremble visibly. I didn't ask her anything, waiting for her to speak, trusting in her self-healing ability. After a moment, she calmed down and said, \"I saw when I was two years old, a significant event occurred in my family; my uncle passed away... His sudden death left no one around except my parents, who discovered he had lost his life only after it happened. All the relatives came to blame my parents, thinking they didn't take care of him; he was only 20, and my parents were a few years older. I couldn't see my parents' expressions or feelings. I looked closely at the timeline and found this event transformed into a tree stump, with a large snake coiling around it. The snake looked venomous, its color constantly changing, and it seemed very frightening. This poisonous snake continuously sprayed toxic gas, a white, mist-like poison that was extremely toxic, enveloping the people around it, causing them to collapse. I looked closely and saw it was my parents. Yes, I looked again; it was my parents, already overcome by the toxic gas, their faces stiff. Every time the snake sprayed its venom, I felt intense fear, my body trembling.\" I listened intently and asked, \"What happened next?\" She said, \"I learned about imagery dialogue from you before, so I thought, it’s a snake, a living being, I can't hurt it, especially since I might not be able to. I started a dialogue with it, thanking it for protecting our family in the past. Now that I’ve grown up, I no longer need your protection. Please leave and go back to where you belong.\" The first time I said this, it stopped spraying poison, looking at me with disbelief. Then, I repeated it a second and third time, saying it many times, and finally, the snake slid down from the stump, slithering away back into the mountains. Then, I hurried to help my parents. I found that I could only see my parents and not anyone else. I found it strange that I couldn't see my sister. She had already been born; according to the timeline, she should have been six months old, a little baby, but I couldn't see her. I helped my parents up, but even once they stood, they were stiff, covered in a white powder of toxic gas. Then, I woke up. I was shocked to see the scene from that time and my parents' state, being so struck that they were stiff and incapable of taking care of me at the time when I was two. But where was my sister? Why couldn't I see her? Was she neglected, severely neglected?\" I asked if she wanted to continue processing. She expressed concern that her parents' stiff state had not been resolved yet. I said, \"Alright, let's continue. Relax again and focus on the growth space around age two, and let’s see how the subconscious wisdom processes this.\" She followed my advice and re-entered her growth space around age two. She observed that the timeline at that point was black. I told her she could cut it out, blur it until it turned white, and then choose a happy or neutral segment from nearby to edit, adding color or pleasant music to it, editing it well, and pasting it over the recently cleared white timeline segment, overlapping the two. Then she could feel and observe the changes in the timeline. She said, \"I extracted a segment of my childhood playing in the mud, and after editing, I pasted it on.\" She saw the timeline brighten, becoming lighter, with the blackness disappearing. Then she saw her parents standing near the house, holding her sister and playing with her. Her sister was very small, just a few months old. Their expressions were calm, in a routine state, but with no smiles. When she returned to reality, I encouraged her to continue feeling her body. She said she felt that the inner unease she had always carried was gone, feeling refreshed. She added, \"Is it because of that event that my parents were psychologically overwhelmed and could not pay attention to my sister? Therefore, she was neglected right from birth, leading to her being unfriendly towards me and those around her?\" Her insight was excellent. Because a child is neglected from birth, without the ability to care for herself, she may feel the world is deliberately persecuting her and view it as a hostile place. Moreover, a child just a few months old cannot speak and will subconsciously remember this, leading to feelings of resentment. This is very possible. I agreed with her realization. She said, \"Teacher, thank you. I understand now; I feel so sorry for my sister, encountering such a disaster right from birth. No wonder she has always competed with me, constantly dressing up to attract others' attention. Her academic performance has been unstable, as her focus has been on gaining others' attention. Meanwhile, until I was two, my parents devoted their full attention to me. I was very well-behaved, quiet, loved reading, and didn't care whether others liked me. I was quite self-centered. This may also be why my sister is unfriendly to me; I always have my interests and many things to engage in, genuinely not paying much attention to her. And she yearns so much for others' attention. I feel sorry for her; I no longer think her behavior is that annoying.\" Later, she repeatedly revisited her growth space and discovered that her parents' smiles were increasing. She learned to independently observe her own growth space and gradually reclaimed her energy, becoming increasingly happy."], "experience_and_reflection": "This case presents a poignant exploration of the complex emotional dynamics between two sisters, uncovering deeply rooted family issues through the innovative use of OH cards and hypnosis. It underscores the profound impact of early childhood experiences on adult relationships and emotional well-being. Upon further reflection, several key insights and clinical analyses emerge that deepen our understanding of the therapeutic process and outcomes observed in this case.\n\nThe utilization of OH cards in this case provides a non-threatening, creative means to explore and express subconscious feelings and perceptions that may not be easily articulated through traditional dialogue. The client's depiction of herself as straightforward and eager to help, contrasted with her sister's aloofness and aesthetic focus, highlights the divergent personality traits and coping mechanisms each sibling developed. This dynamic is not uncommon in sibling relationships, where each child's role within the family can be defined by contrasting characteristics. The client's struggle to reconcile her sister's apparent indifference with her own efforts to support and connect with her underscores the emotional dissonance that often arises from unresolved childhood tensions.\n\nHypnosis, employed here as a tool to access the subconscious and revisit past experiences, serves as a critical intervention in this case. The client's visualization of her timeline as gray in the past and bright in the future reflects a common therapeutic motif: the journey from darkness to light, confusion to clarity, and pain to healing. Encouraging the client to engage with her subconscious wisdom allowed her to reinterpret her past, acknowledging the formative impact of early familial trauma on both her and her sister's emotional development.\n\nThe pivotal moment in the hypnosis session, where the client encountered the metaphorical image of a venomous snake coiled around a tree stump, offers a rich symbol for the toxic emotional environment created by her family's unresolved grief. This imagery provides a visual representation of how unprocessed trauma can envelop family members, impacting their ability to nurture and connect with one another. The client's intuitive dialogue with the snake, an embodiment of the family's protective yet ultimately harmful coping mechanism, demonstrates the power of inner dialogue and the capacity for self-directed healing.\n\nThe absence of the client's sister in her early childhood recollections raises significant questions about the sister's emotional neglect and its long-term effects. The client's realization that her sister's unfriendly demeanor may stem from a deep-seated need for attention and validation sheds light on the adaptive behaviors children develop in response to early deprivation. This insight not only fosters empathy but also prompts a reassessment of the sister's actions through a compassionate lens, recognizing them as survival strategies rather than personal affronts.\n\nThis case also highlights the importance of the therapeutic alliance and the role of trust in facilitating deep emotional exploration and healing. The client's ability to engage with her growth timeline and process complex emotions was significantly bolstered by the trusting relationship established with the therapist. This trust mirrors the secure attachment necessary in early development, enabling the client to feel safe enough to confront and reframe painful memories.\n\nThe client's journey towards understanding and reconciliation with her sister is emblematic of the broader therapeutic goal: to transform suffering into insight and foster a more integrated sense of self. By repeatedly revisiting her growth space and observing changes in her parents' expressions, the client not only altered her perception of past events but also reclaimed her agency, discovering a newfound emotional equilibrium.\n\nFrom a clinical perspective, this case underscores the significance of addressing sibling relationships in therapy, particularly when early familial dynamics are fraught with neglect or favoritism. Sibling interactions often serve as the first social laboratory where children learn about competition, cooperation, and conflict resolution. Unresolved tensions can manifest in adult life as persistent relational challenges, necessitating a thorough exploration of childhood experiences to achieve resolution and healing.\n\nMoreover, the therapeutic process in this case illustrates the efficacy of combining expressive and experiential modalities. The integration of OH cards and hypnosis facilitated a holistic exploration of the client's inner world, allowing for the emergence of symbolic representations of complex emotional states. Such modalities can be particularly effective in cases where verbal articulation of emotions is challenging, offering alternative pathways to insight and transformation.\n\nThe client's eventual empathy for her sister, viewing her behavior as a manifestation of unmet needs rather than malice, is a testament to the transformative power of therapy. This shift in perception not only alleviated the client's longstanding confusion but also opened the door to potential reconciliation and a more harmonious relationship with her sister.\n\nIn conclusion, this case serves as a compelling reminder of the intricate interplay between early childhood experiences and adult emotional landscapes. It emphasizes the necessity of addressing familial legacies and unresolved trauma within the therapeutic context, employing creative and experiential techniques to facilitate deep healing. As therapists, we are reminded of the importance of patience, empathy, and the creation of a safe, trusting environment where clients can explore, reframe, and ultimately transcend their past. Through such work, clients can emerge with a greater understanding of themselves and their relationships, leading to more fulfilling and authentic lives.", "causes": "Sister's Early Childhood Experiences (Traumatic Events, Neglect)", "symptoms": "Troubled by her sister's unfriendly attitude towards herself.", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection;\nOH Card Expression Healing Technique: With the help of\ncards, visitors can express their true views on themselves, their sister and their relationship;\nHypnotherapy and timeline techniques: through the\ntimeline, the client is guided to imagine his or her own\nchildhood upbringing, especially the fragments of his sister's appearance, visualizing them and using their inner strength    and subconscious wisdom to provide themselves with new     perspectives on events;\nImagery Dialogue and Symbolic Techniques: Have an\nintuitive conversation with a venomous snake that symbolizes blame and threat, express gratitude and invite it away.", "characteristics_of_illness": "The client is deeply troubled by the unfriendly behavior of  the younger sister, and the relationship with the sibling may be projected and manifested in a similar way in the relationship\nwith peers and colleagues", "treatment_effect": "The relationship of trust was established, and the client's negative emotions and needs surfaced in the process, and the impact of early    childhood experiences on himself and his sister was clarified through    timeline exploration, which enhanced the client's insight and empathy,  gained a new perspective on current relationship issues, and alleviated the resulting psychological distress."}

Among them was a picture of a particularly beautiful girl, which made Xiao Jia feel a bit envious and jealous. After constantly probing and asking, her boyfriend casually told her that the photo was just of a female internet streamer with whom he had no connection.", "So Xiao Jia began her \"investigation\" into the girl, starting by browsing her boyfriend's Weibo. Later, she found the girl's Weibo, and as she kept searching, the jealousy in her heart gradually faded, and she found herself wanting to pay more attention to the girl, wanting to understand her better, wanting to talk to her, wanting to meet her. Gradually, she felt that the girl was as beautiful as a goddess. Later, driven by curiosity, Xiao Jia secretly checked her boyfriend's WeChat Moments, spending the whole night looking through his interactions with the girl. After the investigation, she confirmed that her boyfriend and the girl had never been in a romantic relationship, and she gradually felt more at ease. In fact, she began to develop an interest in getting to know the girl better, frequently checking her Weibo, searching for her account, name, and anything else she could think of on Baidu. Eventually, Xiao Jia found two small accounts related to live streaming.", "During the summer vacation, Xiao Jia basically did nothing but watch live streams in the girl’s room on the platform provided by her boyfriend, or search for information related to her. Watching the live stream was completely different from what Xiao Jia had imagined; the photos made her seem like a goddess, ethereal and beautiful, but in the live stream, she seemed quite vulgar, telling dirty jokes, and her voice wasn't as sweet as Xiao Jia had imagined. Suddenly, Xiao Jia felt like \"my goddess has been sold to a brothel,\" and she wanted to get closer to her, to save her. Then, out of nowhere, she gifted her two hundred yuan and interacted with her, adding her to the fan group. There was also a strange thought that she wanted to get to know her, hoping that something would happen between her and her boyfriend or that there would be some flirtation, which would make Xiao Jia happy. She found it odd that she had such strange thoughts.", "Love is selfish, yet Xiaojia has the absurd idea of sharing her boyfriend with others, which is truly surprising.", "The consultation for this case was divided into two sessions. In the first session, after I learned some information about her, I employed psychoanalytic techniques to ask her to reflect on past events and analyze them one by one. (First of all, it's important to affirm that she is not a lesbian.) During the reflection process, some valuable information and events surfaced. Xiao Jia mentioned that she is a very strong-willed girl who used to be confident, but currently rates her satisfaction with herself as only 5 out of 10. In the past six months, Xiao Jia has interviewed with several live streaming platforms, all of which ended in failure. One recruitment officer even bluntly told her that she was ugly. This sudden blow to her self-esteem made Xiao Jia feel very inferior, and she began to believe she was ugly. The failure to secure a job felt like a setback, leaving her feeling lost about the future and worried that she would not be able to find a job after graduation. This led to her spending the summer at home without motivation; although she knew she should help her parents with some tasks, she just couldn't muster any interest. She also felt guilty towards her parents for using their money to send gifts to a stranger while not earning any money herself. Xiao Jia's desire to get closer to that girl stemmed from her envy of the girl's beauty, as Xiao Jia felt she was not pretty. She hoped that others would see her as beautiful too, and if her boyfriend were to date or have an ambiguous relationship with that pretty girl, she would feel like they were on the same level, that she was just as beautiful as the other girl. Additionally, she hoped to redeem the goddess through her own efforts, returning to a healthy and meaningful life, and securing a \"pure\" job.", "I actively paid attention to Xiaojia's kindness and debated her unreasonable beliefs, helping her clarify her irrational thoughts and adjust her aesthetic and romantic views. Through inspiration, she realized that such thoughts were a desecration of her own love, a dangerous game between the sexes, and a hidden danger to her stable romantic relationship. She recognized that she had exaggerated the imperfections of appearances and had a one-sided and narrow understanding of job hunting. Xiaojia understood that her lack of confidence was the root cause of her psychological issues.", "In the second consultation, I used hypnosis techniques to help Xiao Jia build confidence. During the hypnosis process, in a subconscious state, Xiao Jia reinforced self-affirmation, and after integrating his personality, he felt great and empowered. After replenishing his energy, Xiao Jia felt a surge of strength throughout his body and described it as a wonderful journey, feeling relaxed and happy.", "After the consultation, Xiao Jia thanked me and summarized the gains from the two sessions. Regardless of whether she is beautiful in others' eyes, the most important thing is to accept herself. She realized that the thought of \"hoping her boyfriend has an affair with that girl\" is actually a childish way to seek validation of her appearance from others. While a beautiful appearance does attract attention, through the teacher's analysis, she understood that beauty is not a passport to happiness and success. Beautiful attributes should be used cautiously, and those who are not conventionally beautiful can enhance their abilities through personal development to do more meaningful and beautiful things. Besides, she is quite good-looking! After summarizing, Xiao Jia playfully winked at me, and I smiled and nodded, giving her an approving look."], "experience_and_reflection": "Confidence is always the pillar for us to live better. Our learning, love, work, and life all rely on confidence. Without it, life can become filled with troubles, losing its color and vitality. Reflecting on Xiao Jia's case, her journey toward regaining confidence and clarity in her thoughts highlights the profound impact of self-perception on mental health and interpersonal relationships. Xiao Jia's initial distress stemmed from a complex interplay of self-esteem issues, societal pressures, and irrational beliefs about beauty and validation. Her case underscores the importance of addressing these cognitive distortions to promote healthier psychological functioning.\n\nIn the therapeutic process, Xiao Jia demonstrated remarkable insight into her own irrational beliefs, which served as a pivotal moment in her treatment. Her initial thought—hoping for her boyfriend to have an affair—was an expression of her internal conflict and low self-worth. She sought validation externally, mistakenly believing that her beauty was defined in relation to others, particularly the girl she perceived as a \"goddess.\" This external validation quest is not uncommon among individuals facing self-esteem challenges, where comparison becomes a toxic cycle that undermines self-acceptance.\n\nThrough our sessions, Xiao Jia's journey toward self-awareness and acceptance was facilitated by psychoanalytic techniques and hypnotherapy. The psychoanalytic approach helped unravel her thoughts, allowing her to confront her irrational beliefs and recognize their origins in her recent experiences. Her attempts to join live streaming platforms and the subsequent rejection she faced contributed significantly to her diminished self-esteem. By addressing these events, Xiao Jia could understand her current mindset and behavior, including her fascination with the internet streamer.\n\nThis case illuminates the role of societal standards of beauty and success in shaping individual self-concept. Xiao Jia's experience reflects a broader cultural narrative where beauty is often conflated with self-worth and potential for success. As a clinician, it's vital to challenge these narratives and help clients build a more nuanced understanding of their own value. Xiao Jia's realization that beauty does not guarantee happiness or success was crucial for her recovery. She learned that her self-worth is not contingent upon superficial attributes but rather upon her intrinsic qualities and abilities.\n\nThe use of hypnotherapy in Xiao Jia's treatment was particularly effective in reinforcing self-affirmation and empowering her to rebuild confidence. Hypnosis provided a space for Xiao Jia to explore her subconscious and integrate positive beliefs about herself. This technique facilitated a shift in her self-perception, allowing her to feel empowered and energized. The process of hypnosis can be transformative, offering clients a profound sense of relaxation and insight that supports long-term change.\n\nFurthermore, the therapeutic journey emphasized the importance of interpersonal relationships in fostering self-esteem and emotional well-being. Xiao Jia's interactions with her parents and friends served as a mirror to reflect her true self, beyond the distorted views she held. Her realization that her loved ones perceive her as beautiful reinforced the notion that genuine self-acceptance is rooted in authentic connections rather than external validation. Encouraging clients to nurture these relationships is essential in building a supportive network that sustains self-esteem.\n\nIn retrospect, Xiao Jia's case serves as a reminder of the delicate balance between integration and detachment in interpersonal relationships. While it's crucial to integrate and connect with others, it's equally important to detach from harmful comparisons and societal pressures that erode self-worth. Teaching clients to navigate this balance can empower them to maintain confidence and resilience in the face of challenges.\n\nUltimately, Xiao Jia's progress highlights the transformative power of therapeutic interventions in addressing self-esteem and irrational beliefs. Her journey from anxiety and confusion to confidence and clarity exemplifies the potential for personal growth and healing through psychotherapy. As clinicians, we must continue to support clients in exploring their beliefs, challenging societal narratives, and fostering self-acceptance. Xiao Jia's case is a testament to the enduring impact of therapy in helping individuals rediscover their inner strength and embrace their unique journey.\n\nReflecting on this case, I am reminded of the importance of adaptability in therapeutic practice. Each client presents a unique set of challenges, and it is our role as clinicians to tailor our approaches to meet their needs. Xiao Jia's willingness to engage with different therapeutic techniques and her openness to self-exploration were integral to her progress. Encouraging clients to embrace change and be receptive to new ideas can significantly enhance the therapeutic process.\n\nMoreover, Xiao Jia's case underscores the need for clinicians to remain vigilant about the impact of societal and cultural influences on mental health. The pervasive nature of beauty standards and the pressure to conform can have profound effects on individuals' self-esteem and emotional well-being. As therapists, we must be proactive in addressing these issues, helping clients build resilience and challenge harmful societal narratives.\n\nIn conclusion, Xiao Jia's journey serves as a poignant reminder of the intricate relationship between self-esteem, societal pressures, and mental health. Her experience illustrates the transformative potential of psychotherapy in fostering self-awareness, acceptance, and empowerment. As clinicians, we must continue to support clients in navigating these complexities, promoting healthy self-perception and nurturing authentic relationships. Through this case, I am inspired to deepen my commitment to helping clients discover their inner strength and live with confidence and vitality.", "causes": "Personal personality factors (low self-esteem and self- confidence), social factors (social aesthetic norms and\nfrustration in finding a job)", "symptoms": "Obsessive thoughts trigger anxiety and confusion", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection;\nPsychoanalysis: Exploring the events and causes behind irrational beliefs;\nHypnotherapy: Boosts their self-confidence and sense of worth, implanting positive beliefs in their subconscious mind to empower them", "characteristics_of_illness": "An irrational belief in a desire to seek external recognition", "treatment_effect": "It helps clients to explore and understand the causes of irrational    beliefs, enhance their self-confidence and self-esteem, improve their    self-acceptance, establish more constructive values, and improve their adaptability and resilience in future studies and lives."}
{"id": 15, "case_description": ["The visitor is clear-headed, self-aware, well-dressed, and speaks clearly, but is feeling quite down, avoiding eye contact, and seems gloomy. Their parents brought them to see a counselor after they had taken a year off school due to a dislike for studying, hoping that the counselor can help them return to school. The visitor does not want to go back to school, does not want to see teachers or classmates, and is unwilling to interact with strangers. They feel very unhappy, find life quite boring, and have suicidal thoughts, having searched online for methods of suicide. They have a strong dislike for their parents; the father has a bad temper and often yells at the younger sister, speaking very loudly, while the mother is nagging, which they find very annoying. Since this is a case involving a teenager, family therapy is recommended."], "consultation_process": ["First Consultation Detailed Record: \nConsultant: Did the child come to consult on his own initiative, or did the parents feel the child needed to see a doctor? \nVisitor Father: He asked us to find a psychologist for him. \nVisitor Mother: He often says he feels uncomfortable and irritable at home. Sometimes he stays up late playing games and doesn't get up in the morning for breakfast. Now he is on a break from school, either playing games or sleeping. \nVisitor: I keep saying these things at home, and when I come to the hospital, can we talk about something else? \nConsultant: It seems like your family came here with some issues. Can you talk about what those issues are? \nVisitor: They are driving me crazy. My dad always lectures me on how to be a good person and how to deal with others, but he often loses his temper at home. My mom keeps nagging about meals, telling me to sleep early, and not to be online all the time. My sister is very noisy, always wandering around the house without a moment of quiet. Staying at home is exhausting; I play games but don't enjoy it, and I can't sleep well. Even when I do fall asleep, it feels uneasy, as if someone is calling me. I'm going crazy at home; it's really uncomfortable. \nConsultant: Do your family members' behaviors make you feel miserable? \nVisitor Mother: We just want him to have a more regular life. He often reverses his day and night, playing games crazily at night and sleeping during the day, which is the opposite of our family's routine. When we call him to eat, he gets angry; sometimes he doesn't get up and just hides under the blanket, and other times he gets up and slams doors or bangs on tables. \nVisitor Father: That's why I told you not to call him; he will get up to eat when he's hungry. \nVisitor: Just to eat, they go on and on about it; it's so annoying. I finish my meal, and they're still talking about my eating. \nConsultant: The disagreement between your parents regarding meals makes you feel more uncomfortable than just getting up to eat. \nVisitor: Exactly! They bring up my issues related to meals, my dad says not going to school is my mom's fault, and my health problems are because my mom often helps me take leave. My dad says it's all accumulated over time, leading to me not going to school. My mom says it's because my dad often goes out drinking and doesn't manage me well. They can turn a small issue into a big argument. \nVisitor Father: We are not arguing; we are discussing things, just a bit more emotionally charged. \nVisitor: My dad's voice is super loud; talking to him feels like arguing. \nVisitor Mother: That’s actually arguing. He avoids problems and never admits when he's wrong. Every argument is about who can shout louder; his self-righteousness is very uncomfortable. \nVisitor Father: I am already tired from work, and my boss is annoying. I just want to rest when I get home, but he talks about our son's and daughter's problems, and he can't even manage the household. \nVisitor Mother: That's because you don't take care of the kids. I handle everything, and since my daughter is so young, I need to take care of her too. I am doing it all alone. You go to work and then want to not deal with anything at home. With a salary of three or four thousand a month, you just buy household items and spend the rest on yourself. You don't manage the mortgage, money, or any family issues; it all falls on me. \nVisitor Father: I do take care of the kids; I handle conflicts between the kids and teachers at school, and I make sure my daughter eats. I am involved! \nVisitor Mother: That's called taking care of the kids? Sometimes when I am out and can't come back, I ask him to make some noodles for the kids, and he just orders takeout, which is all junk food. Once, I was chatting with friends, and when he found out I said he occasionally helps with the dishes, he exploded and said I didn't care about his face. Since then, he hasn't washed a dish. He rarely enters the kitchen, showing a strong sense of male superiority. I don't even know how I married such a man; it's unbearable. (The mother started to cry as she spoke.) \nVisitor: My dad also gets into conflicts with teachers at school, either forcing me to apologize to them or once when our class was noisy, and I wanted to listen to the lecture but couldn't. I turned to a classmate behind me and told them to stop talking. The teacher called me up and said if I spoke again, I'd have to speak at the podium. What's wrong with them? I threw my book and ran out of the classroom. When my dad was called to school by the teacher, he forced me to apologize to the teacher. I refused and he dragged me there, and the teacher said my apology attitude was poor. I explained the situation to my dad, and he started arguing with the teacher. \nConsultant: It seems both the mother and son are not very satisfied with the father. Does the father have anything to explain? \nVisitor Father: I know I have a bad temper; I want to change but can't control it. I've improved a lot in recent years. I used to lose my temper easily, but now I can control it. \nVisitor: When I was little, I was very scared of my dad because he was very fierce. When I did well in elementary school and brought home my report card for him to sign, he was in a good mood. But when I did poorly, he would be very angry and shout loudly. \nVisitor Father: Speaking of this, I need to criticize you. This child pretended to be a parent to sign his name, and the teacher found out. I only learned he did poorly on exams after that. Regardless of the grades, this behavior itself is wrong. \nVisitor: My dad hit me because of this, not considering why I signed it myself. The main reason is that when I did poorly, he always looked terrifying. Who would dare ask him to sign? \nConsultant: When you were little, it seems your parents put a lot of emphasis on your grades, which might make you feel they cared more about your grades than about you as a person. \nVisitor: They just care about their face. When I do well, they brag to the neighbors, and when I do poorly, they scold me. Their grades are indeed more important than their own son. \nVisitor Mother: Actually, we just say it casually; we don't care that much about his grades. If someone brings it up, we might say something about our son. After these people leave, our son gets angry at home, telling us not to talk about him in the future. It's more serious now; when people come to the house, he hides and doesn't come out. Occasionally, when he is thirsty and can't hold it anymore, he comes out to drink water but quickly turns back into his room. \nConsultant: The child doesn't want to be a topic of discussion for his parents; I think he hopes his mom and dad can respect and understand him. \nVisitor: They are very self-righteous, treating me as they think is right without considering my feelings. Once, on Mother's Day, I drew a picture for my mom, and she took it and said, \"This is too ugly.\" Since then, I've ignored Mother's Day; I won't do anything foolish again. \nVisitor Mother: Later, I apologized to you, right? After saying that, I realized I was wrong, but it was too late to save it. The child has held onto this for many years. \nVisitor: What's the use of an apology? I think they are very self-righteous; they don't care about me most of the time, and when they do, they just scold me. They are now treating my sister the same way; when they are happy, they play with her for a while, and when they are unhappy, they scold her. My dad often curses, and my little sister has learned to curse too. Once, when I went to pick her up from kindergarten, the teacher said my sister used bad language to curse other kids. \nVisitor Father: It's just a habit; sometimes I can't help but curse. It doesn't mean anything. After the teacher said something, I changed, but it's hard to control once a habit is formed. \nVisitor Mother: I also tell him not to curse at home; outside, he can say whatever he wants, but at home, it's particularly hurtful to family members. I am often scolded by him; when I get angry, I want to fight him, but I know I can't win, so I just let it go. \nVisitor: They have actually fought before, smashing things in the house. It's terrifying, and it feels like home is a hell on earth! I would hide in my room, afraid to come out. At that time, my sister hadn't been born yet. Living in such a family is worse than being an orphan! Being an orphan means no one manages you, and you're freer. \nConsultant: Perhaps you feel your parents' relationship makes you feel there is no home. \nVisitor: I don't care anymore; as long as they don't interfere with me, I'm fine. \nVisitor Mother: He locks his room at home and doesn't let us in. When he plays games, the door is locked, and he won't let us in. Even calling him to eat feels like an interference. Once, his dad called him for dinner, maybe after calling him over ten times without a response, he got angry and kicked the door in. He was very angry and got into a fight with his dad. I couldn't pull them apart; since then, he treats his dad like an enemy, not talking or calling him. The atmosphere at home has become very oppressive. \nVisitor Father: At that time, I was very angry; my son hit me, and I felt like I was losing control, so I hit him back a few times. Afterward, I regretted it and felt very sorry for him. His mom always scolds me for escalating small issues into big conflicts. I don't know how to educate this son anymore; I can't talk, can't scold, can't hit; I feel helpless and just blame myself for having such a son. \nVisitor: I didn't ask you to give birth to me. \nVisitor Mother: They argue at home, one sentence after another, and then they break things. The dishes in the house are often smashed by them. \nConsultant: It seems both the son and father use the same way to handle conflicts and face difficulties: the father curses, and the child curses; the father smashes things, and the child does too; the father gives the silent treatment, and the child does as well. Today's time is up; I want you to think about why you have such similarities, but are so opposed to each other. Shall we continue next week? \nVisitor Mother: Doctor, then we'll see you next week. \n\nSecond Consultation Situation: \nVisitor complains: The relationship with the teachers at school is quite tense. Since childhood, I have been weak and sickly, often asking my mom to help me take leave, and sometimes the teachers get annoying. In the first year of middle school, I had a decent relationship with my classmates, but during a basketball game, I felt I had decent skills. With the teachers' and classmates' recommendations, I formed a team to compete with other classes, but unexpectedly, I performed poorly and didn't score a single point, feeling like I embarrassed the class. After that, I didn't really like socializing and started playing games with the boys in class, gradually reducing contact with the larger group. \n\nThird Consultation Situation: \nVisitor complains: I really dislike strangers visiting our home. Once, a male neighbor came over while my dad wasn't home, and he was chatting with my mom, just bragging about random things. While chatting, he started smoking, and I said, \"If you want to smoke, go outside.\" My mom started scolding me for being rude. I didn't say anything, and that guy left. After he left, my mom kept saying I didn't know how to talk and was rude. I argued back a bit and unexpectedly got slapped by her. I then ran away from home, thinking of sleeping at an ATM, but it was too cold, so I went back home. I didn't want to go back at first but ended up getting found by my dad, who brought me back. Actually, my mom also hates that neighbor; she often says he owes our family money, but she still hit her own son to protect an outsider. It's very hard to understand. \n\nFourth Consultation Situation: \nVisitor complains: I am afraid of socializing with people. Standing with strangers makes me very uncomfortable, especially during group exercises when so many people stand together. I often skip group exercises but frequently get caught by the teacher, who criticizes me and punishes me by making me stand on the playground platform. To avoid group exercises or physical activities, I often ask my mom to help me take leave from school. Occasionally, when I help my family pick up my sister from kindergarten, there are many parents waiting for their children, which makes me feel very uncomfortable, my palms sweat, and I have difficulty breathing. Now, I go later, waiting until others have picked up their kids before going to get my sister. \n\nFifth Consultation Situation: \nVisitor complains: My dad was arrested for fighting outside, and the house was chaotic during that time. My mom complained about my dad's mistakes at home. After my dad returned, I once overheard my mom talking about how she had to give gifts to get connections to help my dad, and those people took advantage of my dad. I was very angry inside, wishing I could beat those people, but I felt powerless. \n\nSixth Consultation Situation: \nVisitor complains: I feel there is no meaning in this family; living is very painful. I've looked up 100 ways to commit suicide online. Jumping off a building is too bloody; cutting my wrist is too painful, and I worry that some methods like drowning won't be fatal. I plan to burn charcoal on my birthday to commit suicide. Living has no meaning, and dying would be a relief. \n\nSeventh Consultation Situation: \nVisitor complains: I noticed my dad often sneaks in to take my medicine, which is kept in the study cabinet. He always goes in quietly. Once, I found out some medicine was missing, and when I asked him, he denied it. If he is sick, he could come to see a doctor like I do, but it's scary that he just takes medicine casually. I feel like he is more ill than I am. I think if he weren't home, the atmosphere would be much better; my sister would dare to speak up. When he is home, we are afraid to play casually for fear of him losing his temper. \n\nEighth Consultation Situation: \nVisitor complains: I like being alone at home; it feels very comfortable. Although my parents have changed a bit after the counseling, it seems like they are pretending, and it feels like they are being very careful around me. Sometimes they accommodate me, which feels strange. I even prefer not to be with my parents; after dinner, I hide in my room and am even more afraid to be with them. \n\nNinth Consultation Situation: \nVisitor complains: Actually, I don't dislike studying. My parents keep saying I hate studying, which is just their self-righteousness. I just have difficulties in studying and find it hard to concentrate; sometimes, I can't continue with my homework halfway through. I will return to school to study; I will go back when the next semester starts. My grades won't be very good, but I will study until graduation. \n\nTenth Consultation Situation: \nVisitor complains: I feel that what I previously said about social anxiety and internet addiction is not my typical problem. To be precise, I'm not a qualified typical patient. When I'm with people I like and get along with, I feel relaxed. My internet addiction is because there’s nothing fun to do at home, so I play games, but it's because my parents keep blaming and criticizing me that I play even more. Now, it’s fine if I don't play."], "experience_and_reflection": "Family therapy is a powerful modality when addressing the complex interplay of individual and familial issues, as illustrated by this case involving a teenager grappling with school refusal, internet addiction, suicidal tendencies, and social anxiety. This case has highlighted several pivotal elements and dynamics inherent in family systems that contribute to the distress experienced by individual members. The approach of family therapy, focusing on the family as a unit rather than isolated individuals, allows for a comprehensive exploration of these dynamics and facilitates meaningful change.\n\nOne of the primary insights from this case is the recognition that many adolescent issues are not solely intrinsic to the individuals themselves but are significantly influenced by the surrounding family environment. The visitor's symptoms, including feelings of gloominess, social withdrawal, and suicidal ideation, appear to be deeply intertwined with the family dynamics characterized by parental discord, miscommunication, and emotional turmoil. This underscores the vital role of family therapy in identifying and addressing the systemic issues that contribute to individual distress.\n\nFamily therapy aims to alleviate physiological or psychological symptoms by transforming the family dynamics that perpetuate these symptoms. In this case, the therapeutic process involved using techniques such as circular questioning and role-playing, which are designed to uncover underlying patterns of interaction and facilitate new ways of relating. Circular questioning, for example, helped to reveal how each family member's actions and reactions were contributing to the escalation of conflicts, while role-playing offered a safe space for the family members to experiment with alternative ways of communicating and responding to each other.\n\nThroughout the consultations, it became evident that the visitor's reluctance to engage socially and his preference for isolation were not merely symptoms of social anxiety but rather responses to the familial environment. The visitor expressed a deep-seated discomfort with the way his family functioned, often feeling that his parents' communication style was more about assertion than genuine dialogue. This perception was reinforced during consultations where both parents, despite their intentions, frequently devolved into heated discussions that the visitor experienced as oppressive and alienating.\n\nThe family's rigid roles and expectations also played a significant part in the visitor's issues. The visitor's father, with his temperamental disposition and authoritarian approach, inadvertently created a climate of fear and resentment, while the mother, overwhelmed by her responsibilities and her husband's lack of support, struggled to maintain harmony. The visitor's role as the eldest child was fraught with pressure to meet parental expectations, particularly in academic performance, which further compounded his stress and feelings of inadequacy.\n\nThe therapeutic task in this case was to assist the family in adjusting to these dynamics and fostering an environment that could support the visitor's growth and development. This involved facilitating discussions that encouraged each family member to reflect on their roles and the impact of their behaviors on the family system. Through these interactions, the family began to recognize the need for mutual respect and understanding, moving away from blame and towards collaborative problem-solving.\n\nOne significant challenge was addressing the pervasive sense of helplessness and hopelessness felt by the visitor, particularly regarding his suicidal thoughts. Family therapy provided a platform for exploring these feelings in a non-judgmental space, allowing the visitor to articulate his pain and frustrations without fear of reprisal. It was crucial to validate these feelings while simultaneously working towards reconstructing the visitor's sense of agency and self-worth. The visitor's plan to return to school, despite his reservations about academic success, was a pivotal moment in the therapy process, signaling a shift from despair to a willingness to engage with life’s challenges.\n\nAs the therapy progressed, the family began to show signs of change. The parents, through facilitated dialogue and reflective exercises, started to acknowledge their patterns of interaction and the impact these had on their children. The father, who initially struggled with emotional regulation, became more conscious of his tone and approach, working towards creating a more supportive atmosphere at home. The mother, who had been caught in a cycle of nagging and complaint, began to express her needs more constructively, opening up space for genuine communication rather than conflict.\n\nThe visitor's relationship with his sister also became a focal point of therapy, highlighting the importance of modeling positive behavior and communication. The visitor's recognition that his sister was beginning to mimic the negative patterns within the family served as a catalyst for change, prompting him to reconsider his own responses and interactions. This realization underscored the role of family members in shaping each other's experiences and the potential for positive change when individuals become aware of these influences.\n\nAnother key aspect of the therapeutic process was addressing the visitor’s internet use, which had become a refuge from the stressors of family life. Initially perceived as an addiction, it became clear that the visitor’s online activities were a symptom of broader issues related to boredom and the need for escape. By exploring alternative interests and encouraging family activities that promoted engagement and interaction, the therapy aimed to reduce reliance on gaming as a coping mechanism and foster healthier outlets for leisure and creativity.\n\nThroughout the consultations, it was important to maintain a balance between addressing immediate issues and working towards long-term goals. The family's gradual progress was marked by incremental changes in communication and interaction patterns, which, although subtle, laid the groundwork for more significant transformations. The therapeutic process emphasized the importance of patience and persistence, recognizing that meaningful change in family dynamics often requires time and sustained effort.\n\nIn reflection, this case has reinforced the multifaceted nature of family therapy, highlighting its capacity to address both individual and systemic issues within the context of family dynamics.

Time is up; let’s end here today."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on this case has offered me profound insights into the intricate dynamics that can underlie a client's reluctance to take responsibility and their subsequent somatic manifestations. Initially, the counseling process seemed straightforward, focusing on exploring the psychological reasons behind the patient's symptoms. However, as the sessions progressed, it became clear that the issues were deeply rooted in the client's sense of self and psychological development.\n\nThis particular client presented with symptoms that were classic manifestations of anxiety, yet they were deeply tied to his avoidance of responsibility. As we delved into the dialogue, it became apparent that his psychological development was arrested at a stage akin to early childhood. This understanding was pivotal, as it informed the approach taken during the sessions.\n\nThe therapeutic technique employed, psychoanalysis, served as an effective tool in unveiling the underlying motivations for the client's dependency and fear of responsibility. Psychoanalysis allowed the client to project his internal conflicts outward, where they could be examined and addressed. As a clinician, my role was to act as a mirror, reflecting these conflicts back to the client without becoming embroiled in them myself. This stance was crucial in maintaining a therapeutic boundary that empowered the client to confront his own issues rather than relying on the therapist to solve them.\n\nThe client's insistence on finding a method to eliminate symptoms without medication was a clear indication of his desire to shift dependency—from medication to the therapist. This transference is not uncommon in psychotherapy, where clients may seek to replace one form of dependency with another rather than addressing the root cause of their distress. The challenge was to help the client recognize this pattern and encourage him to take ownership of his growth process.\n\nThroughout the sessions, it became evident that the client's symptoms served a dual purpose. On one hand, they provided an excuse to avoid responsibility at work, a setting where he felt most vulnerable and fearful. On the other hand, these symptoms allowed him to maintain a dependent position within his family, where he felt safe and secure. This duality highlighted a significant psychological conflict: the desire for growth versus the fear of losing the security that dependency provided.\n\nThe concept of psychological age became a focal point in the counseling sessions. By identifying his mental age as that of a toddler, the client was able to understand his own reluctance to face adult responsibilities. This realization was both enlightening and daunting for him. It forced him to confront the fact that his symptoms were not merely physical but were intricately linked to his emotional development and self-perception.\n\nA critical aspect of the therapeutic process was addressing the client's belief in the efficacy of past therapeutic interventions, such as hypnosis and desensitization therapies. The failure of these methods, as perceived by the client, was attributed to his lack of true engagement and commitment to change. This realization was crucial, as it shifted the focus from external methods to internal motivation. The therapy aimed to empower the client to recognize that lasting change would only occur if he truly desired it and was willing to invest the necessary effort.\n\nThe sessions often touched on the client's fear of being alone, which was a significant barrier to his personal growth. This fear was a manifestation of his dependency and reluctance to separate from familiar support systems. The therapy sought to help him understand that being alone does not equate to being unsupported. Rather, it is an opportunity for self-discovery and empowerment.\n\nOne of the most challenging aspects of the therapy was helping the client realize that growth is a gradual process, one that cannot happen overnight. His initial desire to transform instantly from a childlike state to a responsible adult was unrealistic and indicative of his need for immediate solutions. This expectation needed to be recalibrated to one of gradual, consistent effort and patience.\n\nA turning point in the therapy was the discussion around keeping a diary. The client's resistance to this task was symbolic of his reluctance to engage in self-reflection and take proactive steps towards change. By challenging his beliefs about the usefulness of the diary, the therapy aimed to encourage him to take small, manageable steps towards self-awareness and growth. The diary was not just a tool for recording daily events but a means of fostering a deeper understanding of his own thoughts and emotions.\n\nThe role of the therapist as a witness rather than a guide or savior was a crucial theme throughout the sessions. This approach emphasized the client's autonomy and responsibility for his own growth. The therapeutic environment was structured to support this realization, providing a space where the client could explore his fears and aspirations without judgment or pressure.\n\nIn reflecting on this case, I have come to appreciate the delicate balance between providing support and encouraging independence in therapy. The goal is not to remove all obstacles for the client but to empower them to navigate these challenges with confidence and resilience. This case reinforced the importance of fostering a therapeutic relationship that is both supportive and challenging, one that encourages clients to confront their fears and take ownership of their growth journey.\n\nThe client’s journey was a testament to the power of self-awareness and the courage required to confront deeply ingrained patterns of behavior. While the path to growth was fraught with challenges, each session provided an opportunity for the client to inch closer to his goal of becoming a responsible, independent adult.\n\nIn conclusion, this case has enriched my understanding of the complexities involved in treating clients with somatic symptoms linked to psychological dynamics. It has underscored the importance of addressing the root causes of dependency and fear of responsibility, and the necessity of fostering genuine motivation for change within the client. As a therapist, my role is to facilitate this process, providing guidance and support while encouraging the client to take ownership of their growth. This experience has been invaluable, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have accompanied the client on this transformative journey.", "causes": "Personal factors (stagnation of psychological and\npersonality development, unresolved psychological conflicts)", "symptoms": "anxiety, somatization (paroxysmal palpitations and chest\ntightness), regression", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection;\nPsychoanalysis: Exploring the deep reasons behind the problem.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Clients have tried hypnosis and desensitization therapy and found it ineffective", "treatment_effect": "The client realizes that the fundamental solution to the elimination of symptoms is his own endogenous motivation, rather than just\nevading responsibility and falling into a circle."}
{"id": 17, "case_description": ["The client is currently facing a significant choice between marriage and work. In terms of marriage, he is preparing to divorce his wife of nearly ten years, which may leave him empty-handed, and their daughter will likely be awarded to his wife. Regarding work, he is planning to leave his job of over three years to become an executive at another company, which would come with a higher salary. However, he feels very hesitant at the moment because he believes he is in love with his girlfriend, with whom he has been together for six months, but she seems to have recently betrayed him by falling in love with another married man. She does not provide the loyalty he needs. He thinks that if he is going to divorce for her, she should at least be loyal to him, be willing to endure hardships together, and allow him to take care of his own child. But currently, his girlfriend is not ready for any of that, which makes him very distressed. In fact, his current marriage is already his second one. Looking back at his first marriage, both he and his first wife were from the same hometown and were very much in love. Later, the company sent him abroad for work, and he took his family with him. Unexpectedly, after going abroad, he became so busy with work that he neglected to care for his wife's emotional needs. As a result, his wife fell in love with a foreigner. He felt he should have given his wife more space to make her own decisions. He took a step back in the relationship and forgot to communicate more effectively, which led to the divorce. His second wife was also the secretary at his company. This wife was from Beijing and had a strong sense of superiority in life, leading to communication barriers between them. After that, he had two affairs with the company secretary. Now, his current girlfriend originally admired and appreciated him, but when he wanted to divorce for her, she ended up cheating. He hopes to achieve personal growth through counseling and learn how to communicate better."], "consultation_process": ["Sitting across from Mr. Su, I can sense some influences from his family of origin. Sometimes, he appears anxious and tends to judge situations primarily from his own perspective. His parents have lived apart for many years, lacking communication, yet they manage to coexist harmoniously. However, after living together in their old age, they have had some arguments, which has taught him a communication style of avoidance and postponement of issues, rather than addressing and discussing them in a timely manner. Instead, he waits for problems to escalate, leading to larger issues and ultimately marital failure. In his childhood, his mother was busy with farming, and his relationships were not very stable or secure. Faced with a father working far away and a mother preoccupied with household chores and farming, he experienced a degree of estrangement and silence, making it difficult for him to express and address problems in intimate relationships. As a child, his sister would take care of him, and the unstable attachment with his mother contributed to his two failed marriages, both of which involved communication issues with his wives. He struggles to handle differing perspectives between genders in marriage, particularly the emotional fluctuations stemming from small changes in his wife's feelings. His first wife still loved him; however, she struggled to adapt while living abroad, which caused some physical and mental discomfort. He was busy with work and found it hard to communicate, leading her to seek emotional support elsewhere, which eventually developed into an affair. Thus, Mr. Su's approach to handling relationships likely contributed to his emotional problems. I used introspective integration therapy to help him reflect on his current feelings, particularly concerning the long-term emotional issues he has felt in his relationships with women. He told the counselor that his primary emotions are avoidance and postponement. When conflicts arise with his girlfriend or wife, he tends to avoid and postpone rather than resolve them immediately. He believes that if both parties take some time to reflect, based on the premise of love, they will be understanding and supportive of each other. He views problems as minor issues in the grand scheme of life, akin to small waves in a vast ocean, and believes that after some time, when emotions settle, the issues will resolve themselves. However, after a few weeks of postponement, when he tries to address the problems, he finds that his wife feels he lacks sincerity and is deeply disappointed, leading to potential conflicts. This cycle continues, accumulating unresolved issues that eventually lead to serious consequences. His current problem stems from his avoidance of issues, which has led to his current affair. However, this affair has not helped him escape his troubled marriage; rather, it has added another layer of conflict. Affairs carry risks and require ongoing adjustments, much like romantic relationships. If he struggles to resolve his emotional issues, he will likely face the same difficulties in an affair, potentially getting stuck in similar patterns. He later compared his wife and his mistress, noting that his wife is more independent, hardworking, and strong-willed. In contrast, his mistress, who was spoiled by her parents, is somewhat delicate and might find it challenging to embrace the simpler, more natural life he desires. Furthermore, his preferred parenting style leans toward a more natural and eco-friendly approach, which his mistress may not necessarily agree with. Through counseling, he expressed a desire to reconcile with his wife and mend their relationship. At this point, I conducted communication training as part of the introspective integration therapy. I guided him to understand that women experience more emotional expression when facing issues, particularly needing to release their feelings. If their problems are not addressed promptly through communication and listening, their stress accumulates and eventually erupts, causing harm to themselves and others. The counselor helped him focus on problem-solving from a woman’s perspective. For example, he learned to listen to women, support them in expressing their emotions, and use appropriate body language. Instead of immediately proposing solutions, he was encouraged to praise his partner’s efforts and recognize her strengths, guiding her to find her own solutions to problems using her own abilities. Mr. Su gradually learned the techniques of cross-gender communication and was determined to have a conversation with his wife. This time, he effectively communicated with her, primarily regarding parenting issues. His wife allowed him to take their child abroad for a vacation during the summer to practice his parenting philosophy, and he felt he finally had some authority in the family. Through counseling and self-reflection, he realized his love for his wife had increased to a 7 or 8, while his feelings for his mistress were only at 5 or 6. He said the affair lacked loyalty and independence, and it was challenging for his mistress to share the hardships he faced. He decided to truly end the affair. When speaking of his wife, he focused more on her positive traits; she is very independent, resilient, and capable of enduring hardships alongside him. She comes from an intellectual family, loves reading, and is knowledgeable, fitting his standards for a partner. Currently, he plans to take their daughter to Australia for a vacation, aiming to be a good father and compensate for the lost paternal love. The counselor guided him through an introspective hypnosis session. During the hypnosis, he entered his subconscious and saw a house where his wife was inside, looking out the window and appearing somewhat lonely. She glanced at him but continued to be alone. When their daughter returned, they both comforted her to sleep. Recently, he has been taking steps to reconcile with his wife. She has forgiven him and noticed his efforts to return to the family, especially his trip with their daughter, which has brought her comfort. They have also reached a degree of reconciliation and mutual understanding regarding their parenting approach."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on Mr. Su's journey through therapy, several profound insights emerge that extend beyond the initial observations. His case presents a complex interplay of personal history, relational dynamics, and emotional growth, which, upon deeper examination, reveal significant aspects of human behavior and interpersonal relationships that are often overlooked. This expansion of Mr. Su’s case reflection seeks to delve into these intricacies, highlighting the therapeutic journey and the pivotal role of introspective integrative therapy in facilitating meaningful change.\n\nTo begin, Mr. Su's upbringing played a pivotal role in shaping his communication style and relational patterns. The avoidance and postponement of issues, learned from observing his parents’ interactions, significantly impacted his adult relationships. His parents' harmonious yet emotionally distant coexistence provided a model that he unconsciously replicated in his marriages. This avoidance strategy, while initially seeming protective, ultimately led to the accumulation of unresolved issues, creating a cycle of emotional withdrawal and relational breakdown. Therapy aimed to dismantle this pattern by encouraging Mr. Su to engage actively with his emotions and those of his partners, promoting a shift from avoidance to engagement.\n\nA critical aspect of the therapeutic process was addressing Mr. Su's perception of love and loyalty, which had been skewed by his experiences. His belief that love could withstand the absence of communication and emotional exchange was challenged. Through introspective integration therapy, Mr. Su explored the meaning of loyalty, realizing that it is not merely about fidelity but involves active participation and support in a relationship. This redefinition helped him understand the importance of mutual emotional investment and the necessity of transparent communication in sustaining a loving relationship.\n\nThe Mars-Venus Gender Therapy provided a framework for Mr. Su to comprehend the differences in emotional expression between genders, which he had previously misunderstood as incompatibility. Women, he learned, often seek emotional validation and support through verbal and non-verbal communication, a need that he had overlooked due to his focus on pragmatic solutions. By adopting a more empathetic approach, Mr. Su began to recognize the importance of listening and validating his wife's experiences, fostering a sense of partnership rather than opposition. This shift was instrumental in bridging the communication gap that had contributed to his marital discord.\n\nMr. Su's introspective journey also involved a reevaluation of his priorities and values. Initially driven by external validations, such as career advancement and societal perceptions, therapy encouraged him to introspectively assess his true desires and needs. The affair, initially perceived as an escape from marital dissatisfaction, became a mirror reflecting his deeper emotional voids. By understanding the transient nature of such escapism, Mr. Su was able to refocus on nurturing his existing familial relationships, which offered a more authentic and sustainable source of emotional fulfillment.\n\nThe introspective hypnosis session served as a transformative tool, allowing Mr. Su to access his subconscious fears and desires. The visualization of his wife’s loneliness and their shared moments of comfort with their daughter revealed the underlying yearning for familial connection and stability. This session highlighted the emotional disconnect that had pervaded his marriage, prompting Mr. Su to take tangible steps toward reconciliation and healing. His realization that his emotional investment in his wife was significantly stronger than with his mistress underscored the importance of resolving deep-seated emotional conflicts rather than seeking external validation.\n\nA noteworthy aspect of Mr. Su's therapeutic progress was his newfound understanding of masculinity and authority within the context of his marriage. His previous attempts to assert his opinions were often met with resistance, leading to feelings of suppression and inadequacy. Through therapy, he learned that true masculinity involves vulnerability and the ability to express emotions constructively. By embracing a more collaborative approach to parenting, he was able to reclaim his authority in a manner that was both respectful and empowering. This recalibration of his self-perception contributed to a more balanced and equitable relationship with his wife, fostering mutual respect and understanding.\n\nFurthermore, the process of emotional repair and relationship rebuilding necessitated Mr. Su's willingness to confront his past mistakes and learn from them. His reflection on the affair revealed the detrimental impact of seeking immediate gratification over long-term relational growth. The affair, initially seen as a means to regain lost affection, ultimately highlighted the importance of loyalty, commitment, and shared values. This realization motivated Mr. Su to invest in his marriage, recognizing his wife's independence and resilience as qualities that complemented his own aspirations for a fulfilling partnership.\n\nThe therapeutic journey underscored the significance of aligning personal values with relational goals. Mr. Su's desire for a more natural and eco-friendly lifestyle, which conflicted with his mistress's preferences, mirrored the larger theme of congruence between personal and relational values. Through therapy, he learned that authentic relationships are built on shared values and mutual respect, rather than mere attraction or admiration. This insight empowered him to pursue a life that resonated with his core values, fostering a sense of fulfillment and harmony.\n\nIn summary, Mr. Su's case illustrates the profound impact of introspective integrative therapy in facilitating emotional growth and relational healing. The therapeutic process enabled him to confront deep-seated patterns, redefine his understanding of love and loyalty, and embrace a more empathetic and communicative approach to relationships. By aligning his personal values with his relational goals, Mr. Su was able to reclaim his sense of self and rebuild his marriage on a foundation of mutual respect and shared aspirations. His journey serves as a testament to the transformative power of therapy in fostering self-awareness, emotional resilience, and relational harmony.", "causes": "Poor communication patterns and behaviours brought about by early life circumstances (parental alienation,\navoidance, and procrastination).", "symptoms": "Feeling lost and troubled by the marital relationship", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection;\nIntrospective Hypnotherapy: Reflection on self-worth and the value that comes from different relationships;\nPsychoanalysis: Exploring the influence of the family of origin;\nMars-Venus Gender Therapy: Understanding the\nDifferences in Emotional Expression Between the Sexes.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Multiple relationship histories", "treatment_effect": "Realizing that their subconscious true desire is family harmony\nrather than approval from an external lover, and the importance of\ncommunication and emotional engagement in a business relationship, the client promotes emotional distancing and relationship\ndevelopment, improves empathy and communication skills, and\nclarifies the importance of self-values aligned with relationship values."}
{"id": 18, "case_description": ["Due to the betrayal of friends, the abandonment by family, and the departure of her boyfriend, at one o'clock in the morning on the 17th of August during the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday, a heart that had been sealed for twenty-five years and was filled with loneliness and despair was ready to stop beating at any moment. In the situation where all crisis intervention hotlines she knew could not be reached, she finally found a help hotline online. With a heart full of despair, she connected to the online psychological emergency hotline (4008789610), which is the service hotline of Yidianling Psychological Service Platform, with the corporate vision of ensuring the mental health of people around the world."], "consultation_process": ["At this critical moment, the on-duty customer service director Fang Zhenwei, who possesses a high level of professional sensitivity and experience, quickly assessed the situation through brief communication and accurate judgment. He identified that although the seeker was initially looking to choose a low-cost general counselor, a careful analysis and assessment revealed that the seeker urgently needed suicide crisis intervention rather than ordinary psychological counseling, and required immediate communication with a senior counselor with rich intervention experience. By precisely matching the seeker's needs and screening the expert's qualifications, Fang Zhenwei urgently contacted senior medical and psychological expert Feng Xinghui. After a brief discussion about the seeker's situation, they conducted an emergency two-hour suicide crisis intervention, which yielded significant results. \n\nAfter my brief introduction, the client incredulously asked, \"What kind of platform is this? Are you a legitimate psychological counselor? What kind of psychological expert are you? What are your fees? Are they expensive? I only want a regular expert for 120 yuan, and I don't know what other processes I need to go through.\" From this series of questions, it was evident that the client was not only extremely insecure but had also lost trust. \n\nAfter this series of inquiries, I answered each one: \"I am Feng Xinghui, a national second-level psychological counselor, national first-level psychological supervisor, and senior hypnotherapist, especially recommended by Director Fang just now. Although I was just awakened from sleep, rest assured I will use my professional abilities and utmost effort to help you. I am both a professor at a hospital and a legitimate and experienced psychological expert. The in-person consultation fee is 1500 yuan, and the online consultation is 600 yuan. Regarding the price, please don’t worry; how much I charge is no longer important. What matters is being able to help you abandon thoughts and actions of self-harm, to live well, to be a little happier, and a little more joyful. That is more important than anything else. Whatever you think is better is fine with me. As for the procedures and processes, those are no longer important. We are currently using the 120 green emergency life fast track online. After the consultation, we can complete the paperwork later; these are not issues at all.\" \n\nThough it was just a brief introduction and warm exchange, it gradually calmed the client's anxious and distrustful heart. The tense moment began. She said, \"I really feel that life has no meaning; I want to commit suicide.\" Although I felt a bit nervous, I quickly calmed my inner self to respond steadily, for if I were to approach this with anxiety and trepidation, how could I help and influence the client to relax and change? I often empathized, quietly accompanied and focused, fully understood and accepted with care, and sincerely loved and nurtured. \n\nI gradually asked the client: \"How long have you had these suicidal thoughts? Have you attempted suicide? Does anyone know about your situation?\" She replied, \"I've had these thoughts for over a year, and I've attempted suicide several times. This time, I've really made up my mind to leave.\" I said, \"Oh! I can feel the immense pain in your heart and completely understand your current feelings! Since that’s the case, could you please talk about what kind of troubles and issues have made you so desperate that you are determined to leave?\" \n\nShe thought for a moment and began to recount slowly: \"I never received love from my parents since I was little. In their eyes, I am just a disappointing bad child. Since I became sensible, my parents have never stopped fighting and quarreling, and they always say they have not divorced because of me, even until now. They bought a house, and my mother worries that if she puts her name on it, I won't recognize them and won't support them, which would disappoint her. They have already divorced. Originally, the house was awarded to my father, but I was kicked out when he got a new woman. One time, I returned from Beijing specifically for a friend's birthday, and I was deceived by what I thought was my only good friend who said she had something to do. In the end, I waited for four hours only to see her return after dining out with other friends. You have no idea how awkward and sad that made me. This feeling of being deceived is unbearable. These all seem trivial, but even more so, I found a boyfriend. Although I felt there was a significant gap in education and culture between us, I truly loved him and relied on him. I thought he was my only hope and lifeline. Later, he also discovered many of my shortcomings and the burden of my father (who is disabled due to a stroke and cannot take care of himself). I didn't want to burden him, so I often stubbornly told him to leave. When he actually left, I felt that my only hope had been shattered. What meaning does living have anymore? It would be better to die and end it all.\" \n\nI replied, \"I really can’t believe it, nor can I imagine what force has supported you to come this far! Such multiple heavy blows are truly suffocating. I’m not sure I could face or accept it better than you! She said, 'Thank you, teacher, for understanding me so well!' I said, 'However, life is very long. Everyone's life may be like this, filled with ups and downs, successes and failures, flowers and applause, as well as thorns and hardships. Your current pain is just a point in your life. Although your parents have hurt you countless times, tiger poison does not eat its children; they do love you. They made you their only and closest person and vented their conflicts, contradictions, and suffering onto you, making you their punching bag, which is hard for you to accept. Their motives are good, but their methods are wrong, which has led you to harbor deep resentment towards them. After all, family ties are hard to sever. Your parents have passed on the most precious thing, DNA, to you, and no matter how wrong they are, they will always be your relatives. I know you are a very filial daughter; treat them well, support them, do your best, and just try to live without regrets.' \n\nShe said, 'Hmm, I understand what you mean, teacher!' I continued, 'Your friend’s betrayal and deception are her own issues; whatever she did is her own business. As long as we are not ashamed of ourselves, there is no need to live under someone else's disdain, punishing yourself for others' mistakes. Changing others is not our responsibility; even her parents cannot change her, let alone you, right? As long as you do well, it's not a big deal. There’s no need to pay too much attention to others' opinions.' She said, 'Oh, I understand now, thank you!' I said, 'As for your boyfriend, being together is a blessing earned over a thousand years. If there is truly no fate, then perhaps separation is a form of relief. If it’s not yours, you can’t keep it, and there’s no need to force it; let nature take its course, okay? Perhaps that’s the wisest choice. Trust your instincts; if you really love him, communicate well and explain why you refuse him. I believe that sincere effort will yield sincere returns.

Although I feel very tired myself, being able to save a family on the brink of collapse and a precious young life on this special Mid-Autumn night makes me, as a psychological counselor on the platform, feel like I am playing the pipa under the bitter orange tree, truly seeking joy amidst suffering. This intervention was not just an encounter between a counselor and a client but a profound human connection that underscored the resilience and potential for recovery in the human spirit. As I reflect on this experience, I am struck by several key insights that deepen my understanding of crisis intervention and the therapeutic process.\n\nInitially, the client's profound sense of despair and hopelessness was palpable. Her story was a tapestry of pain woven with threads of betrayal, abandonment, and a deep-seated feeling of being unloved and unwanted. Her life narrative, as she shared it, was marked by significant relational trauma, with each relationship that should have provided support instead contributing to her sense of isolation and worthlessness. The challenge in such cases is to hold space for this immense pain while gently guiding the client towards a glimmer of hope, a reason to continue. This balance is delicate; it requires a nuanced understanding of the client's emotional landscape and the ability to empathize deeply while maintaining a steady therapeutic presence.\n\nThe intervention unfolded as a dance of empathy and cognitive restructuring. My primary goal was to establish a connection grounded in trust, which was initially fraught due to her skepticism and financial concerns. In crisis intervention, especially with clients who have lost trust in others, the counselor's authenticity and warmth are pivotal. By transparently addressing her concerns about legitimacy and fees, I aimed to dismantle the barriers of mistrust, allowing her to open up about her suicidal ideations and the events leading up to that night.\n\nAs she recounted her history of familial neglect, betrayal by friends, and the loss of her boyfriend, it was crucial to validate her experiences without reinforcing her victim narrative. This validation involved acknowledging the legitimacy of her pain and the real impact of these experiences on her psyche. However, it was equally important to gently challenge her cognitive distortions, such as the belief that her life held no value or that her only lifeline had been severed. Through empathetic listening and cognitive reframing, I sought to help her recognize that while these experiences were undeniably painful, they did not define her entire existence nor dictate her future.\n\nAn integral part of the process was exploring her underlying beliefs about self-worth and love. Her narrative revealed a deep-seated belief that she was unworthy of love and destined to be abandoned, a theme common in individuals with attachment injuries. Addressing this required careful, compassionate inquiry into her self-concept and the origins of these beliefs. By exploring the disconnect between her perceived value and her intrinsic worth, I aimed to help her start the journey of self-compassion and self-acceptance.\n\nMoreover, the session underscored the importance of cultural competence in therapy. In her context, familial ties and societal expectations played a significant role in shaping her experiences and self-perception. Understanding the cultural nuances of filial piety and family dynamics was essential in framing my interventions in a way that resonated with her worldview. Encouraging her to view her parents' actions through a lens of compassion, without invalidating her pain, was a delicate task. It involved recognizing the complexity of her emotions towards her family and guiding her towards a perspective that allowed for both acknowledgment of hurt and a path towards forgiveness and healing.\n\nThe conversation about her friend and boyfriend further highlighted the need for a nuanced approach to relational dynamics. By distinguishing between her actions and others', I encouraged her to reclaim agency in her life narrative. This involved helping her see that while she could not control others' actions, she could choose how to respond to them, thus empowering her to break free from the cycle of victimhood.\n\nReflecting on this case, I am reminded of the transformative power of narrative therapy elements. By helping the client re-author her story, I aimed to shift her perspective from one of hopelessness to one of potential and resilience. This process involved recognizing the strength she exhibited in surviving thus far and reinforcing the idea that her life was a story still unfolding, with opportunities for change and growth.\n\nThe session's conclusion, marked by her expression of gratitude and newfound hope, was a testament to the effectiveness of a compassionate, holistic approach to crisis intervention. It reinforced my belief in the therapeutic alliance as a powerful vehicle for change, especially in moments of crisis. The ability to instill hope and foster resilience, even in the darkest of times, is a profound privilege and responsibility of the therapeutic profession.\n\nAs I reflect further, I am also cognizant of the systemic factors at play. The accessibility of mental health services, the stigma surrounding mental health, and the societal pressures that contribute to feelings of inadequacy are all critical elements that need addressing beyond the individual therapeutic encounter. This case highlights the importance of advocacy and systemic change in creating a more supportive environment for individuals struggling with mental health issues.\n\nWhile I have only done a little of what I should have done, I feel very happy and joyful, and even more, I feel immense pride and honor. Of course, this achievement is not just mine; it is also the result of the silent dedication of every staff member of the Yidianling psychological platform, who worked tirelessly under the leadership of Mr. Xu.

Yidianling is a platform that regards ensuring everyone’s mental health and happiness as its mission and responsibility. Let us cheer for every psychological expert and staff member of Yidianling!\n\nUltimately, this experience has reinforced my commitment to the field of psychotherapy and crisis intervention. It has deepened my understanding of the complexities of human emotion and the profound impact of empathetic, culturally informed therapeutic intervention. As I continue in this work, I carry with me the lessons learned from this encounter, ever mindful of the delicate balance between acknowledging pain and fostering hope, between empathizing with suffering and empowering change.

{"id": 19, "case_description": ["Husband A Cheng (pseudonym), 40 years old, is a teacher at a vocational college. He appears energetic but speaks little and often seems contemplative during consultations. His wife Xiao Fang (pseudonym), 39 years old, works in administration at another university, is relatively talkative, and looks somewhat haggard. Due to marital discord, they have reached the brink of divorce and are concerned about its impact on their child's (11-year-old boy) healthy development, prompting them to seek counseling. Xiao Fang's complaints about her husband include: 1. He is not ambitious and spends all his time at home playing games and reading novels; 2. He is too passive and does not take the initiative to care for family matters, which makes me very tired; 3. He procrastinates, always delaying the tasks I assign; 4. He does not spend time with the child. A Cheng also expressed his grievances, stating that he feels he has no status at home and lacks the voice he should have."], "consultation_process": ["In the consultation, it was discovered that A Cheng always felt that his needs, feelings, and so on were not important. He believed he should show more masculinity and generally suppressed negative feelings. However, when he faced denial or correction, he actually felt uncomfortable internally but did not express it. When asked to give his opinion, he displayed indecision and caution. When he spoke in areas where he excelled, he sometimes exaggerated or boasted. On a conscious level, he wanted to prove his worth through actions rather than words, while on a subconscious level, he felt that others considered him worthless. In reality, he was repeatedly proven to be without value. On another dimension, Xiao Fang's self-worth was different; she often felt her work was worthless and lamented that she had no notable achievements. However, when she found hopeful things, she would excitedly prepare seriously. She felt very disappointed when seeing her husband and child on their phones and iPads, but felt very satisfied when they were studying. She was very happy when her child achieved success and also felt happy when her husband did, but unconsciously tried to prove that he was not that great. She was quite concerned about her feelings, especially the negative ones, which were deeply imprinted in her memory. At home, Xiao Fang was the main decision-maker and would seek help from her mother for difficult issues. She found it hard to accept differing opinions or suggestions from others, especially from her husband, and even subtle comments about her shortcomings from A Cheng were difficult to accept. On a subconscious level, she felt she had to be very (most) valuable, yet often self-blamed for feeling worthless, hoping to cultivate her child's achievements to prove herself and wishing her husband’s achievements would validate her judgment, while fearing her husband's value might surpass her own. The self-worth of A Cheng and Xiao Fang manifested as a clear opposition and unity. A Cheng sought someone to prove his worthlessness; his previous girlfriends were his \"fans,\" but he gave up until Xiao Fang appeared, torturing him and continuously proving he was worthless. Conversely, Xiao Fang needed to prove that she was the most valuable one. Although she had had boyfriends with better overall conditions than A Cheng, she chose to marry him when he was at a low point in his life. What’s the strange repetition between the couple really about? Let’s first look at A Cheng’s situation. A Cheng was born into a poor rural family. His ancestors were wealthy farmers who became rich through hard work, but later lost their property during land reform. A Cheng’s father inherited only a water bucket and a carrying pole. A Cheng’s grandfather passed away when A Cheng’s father was 12, and A Cheng’s grandmother, unable to raise her and her two children, remarried. At 12, A Cheng’s father had to abandon his education, filled with anger, to work and support himself and his younger sister. A Cheng’s father was confident and had read books, overcoming various difficulties to support himself and his sister (A Cheng’s aunt). During this process, he was often bullied due to their vulnerability, but his explosive personality and willingness to fight protected them as they grew up. At that time, social status was important, and he was matched with A Cheng’s mother, who had a good family background. A Cheng’s mother had not been educated, was gentle and kind, and took care of her family, which frustrated A Cheng’s father (the absolute authority at home) and often led to arguments. Whenever they had intense quarrels, the children were terrified. A Cheng’s father was very strict with the children, and they all feared him. A Cheng lacked a sense of security from a young age. Several memories stood out vividly for A Cheng. 1. A Cheng was the fifth child and the youngest (with two older brothers and two older sisters). Due to the family's poverty, A Cheng's mother lacked nutrition and could not breastfeed after giving birth, so he drank his aunt's milk as a child. Whenever adults joked about this, little A Cheng felt extremely ashamed. 2. One day after school, his father, who had never taken him out to play, suddenly said he would take A Cheng out. They rode a bicycle, with A Cheng perched on the triangle frame, and little A Cheng anxiously asked, “Where are we going?” His father replied, “Just for fun,” while little A Cheng felt terrified inside, worrying that his father might abandon him. 3. Due to the family's difficulties, A Cheng grew up wearing his brothers' old clothes and was even teased by neighbors for wearing his sister's skirt. During the first-grade Children's Day celebration, the school required all students to wear new clothes with a white top and blue bottom for the parade. Since everyone’s economic situation was not good, the teacher started urging the children over a month in advance to talk to their families about their “festive attire.” A Cheng’s mother had to painfully lie to him daily, saying “We’ve bought the fabric” or “It’s being made,” until the day of the event when she dressed him in a white shirt with green patterns, insisting “This is white clothing; you just don’t understand!” A Cheng’s siblings went along with this grand deception. Little A Cheng skeptically wore this “white” shirt to school, and by the time he arrived, all his classmates were already lined up in colorful outfits, waving various flags. Little A Cheng timidly reported to the teacher, who was taken aback by his shirt and loudly scolded him in front of everyone, “What are you wearing? Go back home!” At that moment, little A Cheng felt extremely ashamed and scared, wishing he could just disappear. 4. A Cheng wet the bed easily and continued to do so until the second grade. A neighbor nicknamed him “Pump Pump,” and he was often mocked by adults and children alike. Little A Cheng usually just blushed and pretended he didn’t hear. 5. As a child, A Cheng struggled academically, and his neighbor cousin, who was in the same class, often bragged about her better grades. A Cheng's father would scold him for being useless, saying, “You’re really hopeless!” and even locked A Cheng in a room to supervise him while studying. Little A Cheng wanted to study but didn’t know where to start. He would lie on his bed, bored, and when his father saw him playing from outside the window, his disappointment in A Cheng only grew. 6. Little A Cheng sometimes wanted to join adult discussions and contribute, but his father and brothers would often say, “Adults are talking; kids should not interrupt, go away!” 7. During winter break in fifth grade, A Cheng happily returned home with his backpack, only to find his parents arguing loudly again, with his father’s voice booming and his mother cornered. A Cheng felt very angry, thinking how could his father bully his mother like that? Feeling that he was grown up and should do something, young A Cheng stood at the door, fists clenched, eyes wide with fury, glaring at his father, only to be met with a dismissive glance from his father, who said, “What? Grown up now?” leaving A Cheng feeling extremely scared. After hearing A Cheng’s childhood experiences, the counselor took a deep breath and began to understand A Cheng’s behavior in his marital relationship. Through further consultation, A Cheng gradually became aware of the issues related to his self-worth that manifested in his marriage and began to understand the origins of these issues. Xiao Fang also gained more understanding of him. A Cheng was born into a poor family that was often bullied. His father's explosive anger and the constant arguments between his parents, along with insufficient breastfeeding, made him lack security from a young age. Wearing his siblings’ clothes and drinking his aunt’s milk led him to doubt whether he was “bad,” resulting in feelings of worthlessness, which contributed to A Cheng placing great importance on intimate relationships as they repeated the patterns of attachment. The incident of being taken out by his father after school, while intended as a good gesture, was perceived through his lens of self-doubt as a sign that his father might abandon him, creating a strong sense of fear—an extremely significant matter for a child! His frequent bedwetting may also relate to testing his parents' love, wondering if being “bad” meant his parents would not love him. At the same time, this method of testing often resulted in more feelings of shame. The incident on Children's Day regarding clothing was especially damaging for him, as not only did the teacher’s public reprimand severely hurt his dignity and sense of self-worth, but the deception by his mother and siblings further crushed his already fragile self-esteem! Given that boys develop later than girls physically and mentally, combined with A Cheng’s constant focus on his self-worth issues, he could not concentrate on his studies, leading to poor academic performance. Academic success is often the most important indicator for adults to evaluate children, thus reinforcing his sense of being “useless.” Little A Cheng essentially accepted that he was a person lacking value, but internally, there must have been struggles, prompting him to constantly seek to prove his worth. His desire to participate in adult discussions and contribute was, in essence, a way to prove himself. The confrontation with his father, however, led to intense fear and ended in retreat. As a result, he often displayed behavior in front of his parents that suggested, “I’m not grown up yet,” or “I’m not capable.” Although his father and siblings would criticize him for being useless, which made him sad, at least he didn’t have to face the fear of his father’s questioning. Consequently, in real life and in his marital relationship, he exhibited such strange repetitions: wanting to prove his value, yet consistently being told by his wife that he was worthless, thus easily leading to the outcome that his wife felt he was indeed worthless, creating a vicious cycle. We finally understand A Cheng’s situation; is Xiao Fang’s situation the same or the opposite? Let’s first look at Xiao Fang’s background. Xiao Fang’s father lost his father at the age of five, and in that era, a five-year-old was much more naive than today’s children. She had five to six older siblings (not very clear), and one who died young, making Xiao Fang’s father the youngest. Xiao Fang’s grandmother was broad-minded, living to her eighties, but uneducated and sometimes rough. While working in the fields, she would place Xiao Fang’s father on the ridges to sleep, often forgetting about him until the evening. Xiao Fang's father grew up under a careless mother in a very difficult living situation. With her father gone, the oldest brother took on a paternal role, and Xiao Fang’s uncle cared for Xiao Fang’s father to some extent, arranging for him to work in a state-owned enterprise when he was nine, which was quite difficult to achieve. An older sister also cared for him somewhat. However, starting at age nine, Xiao Fang’s father had to pick stones to support himself. As he grew older, he worked as a mechanical technician, becoming skilled despite lacking formal education. Xiao Fang's father was introverted, sensitive, and timid, lacking capability in both life and work. He was slow to think and possibly had low intelligence, showing signs of depression. When he argued with Xiao Fang's mother and reached a certain point of being criticized, he would sometimes cry on the ground like a child. Xiao Fang’s mother was the daughter of her grandmother and her third husband. She had a daughter from her first marriage, who was Xiao Fang’s aunt. It is said that Xiao Fang’s grandmother fled from her previous marriage and married Xiao Fang’s grandfather, who, although poor, was hardworking and kind to her. Their financial situation gradually improved after marriage. Xiao Fang’s grandmother was smart and capable, managing the household rationally but was also somewhat sensitive. Xiao Fang's mother was exceptionally intelligent and performed well academically, garnering admiration both at home and school. In a family that faced financial struggles, she always dressed beautifully and brightly. She was outgoing, confident, independent, rational, and could manage the household but was also sensitive. When Xiao Fang’s mother was in the second year of junior high, she fell seriously ill (gallstones, which were difficult to treat in the era) and had to take a year off school. When she returned, the Cultural Revolution began, and she could no longer attend school, with only three options available: support the frontier, support agriculture, or marry. Xiao Fang’s mother chose to marry, hastily selecting a husband with good credentials (a worker) who was also a state grain supplier—Xiao Fang’s father. After marriage, they built a house together with just a brick and a load of earth, without any financial support or help from others. Their siblings were preoccupied with their own lives, and Xiao Fang’s grandmother had little guidance for them, which left Xiao Fang's mother feeling quite resentful. As time went on, it is easy to imagine the challenges faced by two individuals from such different economic backgrounds and family dynamics—an introverted person paired with an extroverted one, a timid individual with a confident counterpart, someone lacking in ability with a capable partner, a poorly educated person with a high-achiever, and low intelligence alongside high intelligence—combined with both being sensitive. Xiao Fang's parents often had intense arguments, especially since her father spent years with his work friends and developed a gambling habit. Despite this, they had three children together, with Xiao Fang being the youngest, along with an older brother and sister. Her brother was smart and studious, always achieving the best grades and receiving admiration at home and school, while her sister was outgoing but academically weaker, yet quite industrious and helpful to their mother. Around the age of 40, Xiao Fang’s father suffered an injury at work and was completely on sick leave. The family's survival then relied heavily on Xiao Fang’s mother, who initially made clothes for others. After her husband fell ill, she worked hard to support the family, sewing clothes in her spare time while also collaborating with others to run a factory, often traveling nationwide for business. This was no easy feat! As a result, the family's financial situation improved rapidly. During arguments, Xiao Fang’s parents frequently mentioned divorce, causing significant fear among the children. Although Xiao Fang’s brother was afraid, he would try to mediate and comfort his two younger sisters during their parents’ quarrels. When their parents argued, Xiao Fang and her sister feared that if their mother took their brother with her, it would be hard for them to survive with their father. Growing up in such an environment, Xiao Fang became introverted, timid, self-deprecating, and obedient. She maintained above-average grades, but her mother constantly emphasized Xiao Fang’s academic success, which added pressure. Witnessing daily conflicts between her parents made Xiao Fang feel very self-conscious and fearful. When strangers visited, she would quickly retreat to her room. During the college entrance examination, Xiao Fang performed well but, due to her low self-esteem, hesitated to apply to better schools (which needed to be done before the exam). Her mother was hardworking but dominant at home, often criticizing her father. Xiao Fang felt conflicted; she empathized with her mother’s struggles but also resented her, feeling both repulsed by and reliant on her. Her mother was the family’s emotional and financial backbone, and Xiao Fang recognized how difficult her mother's life was, deserving admiration. At the same time, she worried about her mother’s health (in fact, Xiao Fang’s mother had a relatively weak constitution) and feared she might fall ill. Whenever Xiao Fang saw her mother exhausted and lying in bed, she felt both concern and fear. Her mother represented the first feminine figure in her mind. As an adult, Xiao Fang mirrored her mother’s image: men are useless, and women are the backbone, though it is not easy. If someone could help, that would be ideal. However, unlike her mother, who had a good upbringing and became a source of positive energy, Xiao Fang lacked such positive resources. The same went for her father; she felt pity and helplessness, unable to find security in him, who seemed “useless,” particularly since her father appeared mentally unstable, making her feel inferior. Although she found her father unsatisfactory, he was still her father, and her mother’s constant criticisms left Xiao Fang feeling helpless as a daughter. Naturally, this made it unlikely for her to develop natural affection for her father. Her father became the first male figure in her life, casting a deep impression: useless and untrustworthy. Her father’s brother to some extent filled the father role, but he was still her brother, and competition among siblings existed, especially during their parents’ arguments. Their deepest concern was that the capable mother would only take the excellent brother. If she could take two, Xiao Fang believed she should be the next, as she performed better than her sister. Thus, Xiao Fang grew up to be very obedient and diligent in her studies, hoping to be as outstanding as her brother. Subconsciously, she believed that being the best was the safest option, yet felt a deep sense of powerlessness; with her brother’s excellent performance, how could she surpass him? Her brother treated her well, making it impossible to think about exceeding him, so this thought had to be suppressed into her subconscious. This understanding helps explain why Xiao Fang is so strong-willed yet sensitive, unable to accept even minor corrective suggestions, wanting to prove that she is the most valuable one, while simultaneously often feeling helpless, with a sense of lacking value. Now that we have analyzed both A Cheng’s and Xiao Fang’s situations, what kind of sparks emerge when they come together, evolving into a discordant marital relationship that affects their child's healthy growth? In fact, Xiao Fang’s outward behavior aligns perfectly with A Cheng’s deep-seated belief that women need protection and are weak, and she does not express the admiration and respect that his previous girlfriends had for him. This familiar feeling is both painful and pleasurable for him. When Xiao Fang first met A Cheng, his awkward situation and still-poor family background made her feel secure, as if their union meant A Cheng was turning to her for refuge. Moreover, A Cheng’s outward confidence and masculinity were precisely what Xiao Fang desired. Thus, they overcame Xiao Fang's mother’s objections and other difficulties to successfully come together. A Cheng placed great importance on their marital relationship, even feeling it was more important than his career, and cared for Xiao Fang greatly. Initially, Xiao Fang felt good about this, especially when she sensed her own bouts of depression (the counselor assessed her with a depression self-rating scale, scoring 63, but with no suicidal thoughts). A Cheng was particularly gentle and cautious when Xiao Fang was struggling, so when they first entered the counseling room, he was afraid to express his dissatisfaction with her. However, after their marriage, A Cheng’s kindness gradually became habitual, and underlying this “goodness” was an implication: women are weak and need care. While this underlying meaning might be acceptable to many women, Xiao Fang perceived it as a threat (even if she could not clearly articulate this): he thinks I am weak and worthless. What does lack of value mean to her subconsciously? Abandonment! Furthermore, for Xiao Fang, her mother was busy with work and life and had little time to care for her, while her brother received more attention and appreciation than Xiao Fang and her sister. Xiao Fang felt that a good relationship was one where she continuously received attention and appreciation, which validated her worth. As a result, Xiao Fang became increasingly dissatisfied with A Cheng’s kindness. Given Xiao Fang's upbringing, we can easily understand this need. However, this exceeded A Cheng's capacity. For a young man, aside from marriage, he also had his own work and life, making it impossible for A Cheng to meet Xiao Fang’s expectations for “goodness.” Moreover, he had never experienced continuous attention and appreciation himself. Due to his upbringing, A Cheng, although he did not like it, still carried some traits of a traditional male. For sensitive Xiao Fang, this was intolerable. In her mind, she believed, \"With your poor conditions, accepting you is already a favor; you’re the one seeking my support, yet you act so self-important!\" However, A Cheng never saw himself as seeking Xiao Fang’s support; he believed his poor financial situation at the time of their marriage was merely due to a bad investment, resulting in no savings. He thought his income was comparable to hers, and while Xiao Fang’s family environment was somewhat better, it had nothing to do with their relationship; they did not need financial assistance from her family. Their perspectives on money were quite different. Both families had been relatively poor during their childhoods. A Cheng had made money in previous investments, though not much, but later lost everything due to failed investments. After marriage, their income as university teachers was sufficient but not abundant, and A Cheng was more focused on a loving marital relationship, as he realized making money in academic positions was not feasible. In contrast, Xiao Fang’s parents had worked tirelessly to build their lives from scratch, especially her mother, who was the main economic support (Xiao Fang’s father did receive a small salary while on sick leave) and occasionally used this to criticize Xiao Fang’s father. Xiao Fang believed that being able to earn money signified capability, value, and authority. In her reality, she often measured herself against colleagues and friends with better financial situations, feeling poor and lacking in worth, dignity, and security. Consequently, financial issues became a frequent source of conflict between them. Xiao Fang felt little respect for her father. In her mind, he was useless, and while her mother’s constant criticism was not ideal, she believed the intense arguments stemmed from her father’s refusal to listen to her mother and his tendency to argue back. Thus, she harbored a strong desire for her father to heed her mother and not counter her. In their actual married life, A Cheng lacked notable achievements at work and did not seem very motivated, paralleling her father in Xiao Fang’s subconscious. This projection led her to view A Cheng as similarly worthless. When A Cheng sensed this, he felt uncomfortable, but since he had long accepted his lack of value, he did not react strongly. Moreover, as a man, he did not want to constantly argue with his wife. Xiao Fang’s perception of A Cheng’s lack of objection reinforced her feeling of “worthlessness.” Although A Cheng’s demeanor reflected discomfort, Xiao Fang interpreted it as, “You want to argue again!” thus increasing her dissatisfaction with him. Xiao Fang felt immense sympathy for her mother, recognizing how challenging her life was. She wished someone could have helped her mother, especially hoping her father would step up and demonstrate his worth, but that was impossible. After marriage, Xiao Fang felt her security (that she wouldn’t be abandoned) was met, so she began to desire assistance in her career advancement and financial situation, especially expecting her husband to take on this basic responsibility. However, A Cheng was just an ordinary teacher and could not help her advance; in fact, he secretly hoped she would not become a “strong woman” and felt “helpless” regarding finances. This only further reinforced Xiao Fang's evaluation of A Cheng as “incompetent and worthless,” leading to her disrespect for him. A Cheng, feeling disrespected, felt both uncomfortable and somewhat secure (being incompetent meant he wouldn’t have to worry about being targeted by his father). Xiao Fang’s mother had borne the burden of supporting a family from poverty to basic survival and then to a better life, which was no easy feat. However, as a woman, she also had vulnerabilities, and this anxiety manifested as control over her husband and children. This controlling behavior, rather than being straightforwardly controlling, also represented a form of counter-attachment. Xiao Fang unconsciously adopted this method of dealing with anxiety, exerting control over her husband and children. This control, especially over her son, contained a sense of counter-attachment. Consequently, their marital relationship deteriorated, leading to the peculiar scenarios described earlier. Regarding their children, although A Cheng and Xiao Fang’s relationship was strained, A Cheng’s forbearance meant that intense arguments were infrequent. In their children's eyes, A Cheng never received respect, which naturally hindered their development, causing them to seek affirmation from the authoritative figure at home. Even though Xiao Fang was often controlling, she treated her children very well. As a boy, identifying with his mother made him likely to develop feminine tendencies. Additionally, due to A Cheng's lack of authority at home, he could not assert his paternal rights to separate the overly close mother-son bond, allowing excessive indulgence in their attachment and his control. Even at eleven, the boy had not established boundaries with his mother, leading to a lack of personal responsibility. Thus, until the third or fourth grade, the child was relatively obedient to his mother and performed well academically. However, as he grew older, he became more susceptible to distractions like games, and when faced with academic difficulties, his motivation waned. After understanding the behaviors and interactions in their marital relationship and the underlying issues with their children, the counselor employed gestalt therapy to help them address their unfinished childhood business. By the 19th session, both spouses left the counseling room feeling relieved and hopeful."], "experience_and_reflection": "Through this case, I gained profound insights into the intricate dynamics of marital relationships and the profound impact of childhood experiences on adult life. A Cheng and Xiao Fang's journey vividly illustrates how early life events can silently shape our deepest selves, influencing our perceptions, behaviors, and interactions within intimate relationships. Reflecting on this case has enriched my understanding of the delicate balance between self-worth and relational dynamics.\n\nOne of the key lessons from this case is the subtle yet pervasive influence of childhood experiences on adult life. A Cheng's early experiences of shame, insecurity, and perceived worthlessness were deeply imprinted in his psyche. His father's explosive anger and the lack of a nurturing environment contributed to his internalized belief of being inadequate. This deeply rooted sense of inadequacy manifested in his marital relationship with Xiao Fang, where he constantly sought validation yet feared it simultaneously. The incongruence between his conscious desire to prove his worth and his subconscious belief in his worthlessness created a paradox that played out in his marriage.\n\nSimilarly, Xiao Fang's upbringing, marked by the duality of her parents' roles, instilled in her a complex understanding of self-worth and security. Her mother's dominance and her father's perceived inadequacy left her oscillating between feeling invaluable and worthless. This internal conflict was mirrored in her relationship with A Cheng, where her need for control and validation clashed with her fear of abandonment. Her interactions with A Cheng were colored by these deep-seated fears, leading to a cycle of dissatisfaction and discontent.\n\nThe interplay of A Cheng and Xiao Fang's unresolved childhood issues created a vicious cycle in their marriage. A Cheng's passive behavior and Xiao Fang's need for validation and control perpetuated a dynamic where neither felt truly valued or understood. This cycle not only affected their relationship but also had significant implications for their child, highlighting the transgenerational transmission of unresolved issues.\n\nThe case underscores the importance of addressing unfinished childhood business to prevent its detrimental impact on adult relationships. It became evident that A Cheng and Xiao Fang were, in many ways, attempting to resolve their childhood incompleteness through each other. Yet, without awareness and healing, these attempts were futile, akin to \"carving a boat to seek a sword.\" This metaphor aptly describes the futility of trying to find solutions to deep-seated issues through external means without addressing the internal wounds.\n\nMoreover, the case demonstrates the necessity of personal healing for breaking the familial cycle of repeating past tragedies. Without addressing their individual issues, A Cheng and Xiao Fang risked perpetuating these dynamics in their child's life. Their son's emerging behavioral patterns and academic struggles were a reflection of the unresolved issues between his parents. Recognizing this pattern was crucial for both parents to take proactive steps in altering their relational dynamics and providing a healthier environment for their child.\n\nIn exploring the nuances of their relationship, I observed that marital relationships often serve as a mirror reflecting our deepest fears and desires. For A Cheng, the lack of respect and validation echoed his childhood experiences of inadequacy. For Xiao Fang, the fear of abandonment and need for control mirrored her childhood insecurities. Their marriage, initially a union of complementary needs, evolved into a battleground for unresolved issues, highlighting the fragile nature of marital bonds when personal healing is absent.\n\nThis case also reinforced the value of conjoint marital counseling. Having both partners present allowed for a deeper exploration of their dynamics and provided a platform for mutual understanding and empathy. Through the counseling process, A Cheng and Xiao Fang gradually recognized the origins of their issues and began to develop a more compassionate understanding of each other's struggles. This mutual recognition was a pivotal step in their journey towards healing and rebuilding their relationship.\n\nFinancial issues emerged as a significant source of conflict, reflecting deeper issues of self-worth and validation. Xiao Fang's perception of financial success as a marker of value and authority clashed with A Cheng's contentment with their economic status. This disparity in their financial perspectives was not merely a practical issue but a manifestation of their underlying self-worth struggles. Addressing these differences required a shift in focus from external markers of success to internal validation and fulfillment.\n\nThe role of gender dynamics in their relationship also provided valuable insights. A Cheng's traditional male traits and Xiao Fang's strong-willed nature created a dynamic where gender expectations and roles were both challenged and reinforced. Understanding these dynamics was crucial in helping them navigate their relationship and redefine their roles in a way that honored both their individual and collective needs.\n\nReflecting on this case has deepened my appreciation for the complexity of human relationships and the intricate web of factors that influence them. It has reinforced the importance of viewing marital issues through a multifaceted lens, considering the interplay of individual histories, relational dynamics, and broader societal influences. This holistic perspective is essential for effective intervention and lasting change.\n\nThe case also highlighted the transformative power of empathy and understanding in healing relational wounds. As A Cheng and Xiao Fang began to understand each other's backgrounds and struggles, they developed a newfound empathy that paved the way for healing. This empathy was not merely a cognitive understanding but a deep emotional resonance that allowed them to connect on a more profound level.\n\nIn terms of clinical practice, this case emphasized the importance of creating a safe and supportive therapeutic environment where clients can explore their vulnerabilities without fear of judgment. Facilitating this process requires sensitivity, patience, and a deep understanding of the human psyche. As clinicians, our role is to guide clients in uncovering their hidden wounds and empower them to embark on their healing journey.\n\nThe journey of A Cheng and Xiao Fang also serves as a reminder of the resilience of the human spirit. Despite the challenges they faced, both individually and as a couple, they demonstrated a remarkable capacity for growth and transformation. Their willingness to confront their issues and work towards healing is a testament to the potential for change that exists within all of us.\n\nIn conclusion, this case has been a rich source of learning and reflection. It has deepened my understanding of the complexities of self-worth, relational dynamics, and the enduring impact of childhood experiences. It has reinforced the importance of addressing unfinished business to prevent the perpetuation of familial cycles and highlighted the transformative power of empathy and understanding in healing relational wounds. As a clinician, I am grateful for the opportunity to witness and facilitate this process of healing and growth, and I am committed to applying these insights to support other clients on their journeys towards wholeness and fulfillment.", "causes": "The early upbringing environment and life events create a\nsuperficial but actual conflict between the two parties", "symptoms": "Feeling lost and troubled by the marital relationship", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection;\nJoint Marriage Counselling: To provide a platform for\ncommunication, communication and mutual understanding;\nPsychoanalysis: Exploring the influence of the family of origin;\nSchema Therapy: Understanding the impact of poor schemas formed in childhood on the present moment.", "characteristics_of_illness": "The deep inner needs of the two due to their childhood\nexperiences match their superficial values", "treatment_effect": "The two sides understand and recognize each other, and feel relieved and hopeful."}

The case of Xiao Liu, a high school sophomore experiencing heightened anxiety due to unsatisfactory exam results, serves as a poignant reminder of the pressures faced by adolescents in contemporary educational settings. As I reflect upon this case and the therapeutic interventions employed, several key insights and considerations emerge.\n\nFrom the onset, it was evident that Xiao Liu's anxiety was not an isolated incident but rather a manifestation of the broader educational and societal expectations that many students face. The pressure to perform well in exams is deeply ingrained in the educational culture, particularly in regions where academic success is closely tied to future opportunities. In Xiao Liu's case, the anxiety was compounded by the timing of the exams, which fell during a period when students are also making crucial decisions about their academic and career paths. This context underscores the importance of providing a supportive environment that not only addresses the immediate symptoms of anxiety but also fosters long-term resilience and coping strategies.\n\nThe systematic desensitization method, tailored to Xiao Liu's unique personality traits and the nature of her issues, proved to be an effective intervention. This technique, which involves gradually exposing the individual to anxiety-inducing stimuli while simultaneously employing relaxation techniques, helped Xiao Liu confront her fears in a controlled and supportive setting. Throughout the consultations, it was imperative to ensure that Xiao Liu felt comfortable and understood, as a strong therapeutic alliance is a cornerstone of effective counseling. This case reinforced the importance of establishing trust and rapport early in the therapeutic process, allowing the client to feel safe in exploring their vulnerabilities.\n\nDuring the initial consultation phase, the focus was on gathering comprehensive information about Xiao Liu's background, her experiences, and her perceptions of her anxiety. This diagnostic assessment was crucial in tailoring the intervention to her specific needs. It became apparent that Xiao Liu's anxiety was not only related to the fear of failure but also tied to a deeper sense of self-worth and identity. The feedback from psychological testing and the in-depth conversations provided valuable insights into her cognitive and emotional processes, which informed the development of a personalized consultation plan.\n\nAs the sessions progressed, Xiao Liu was introduced to relaxation techniques that served as foundational tools for managing her anxiety. These techniques, which included guided imagery and progressive muscle relaxation, were instrumental in helping her attain a state of calmness. The incorporation of these strategies into her daily routine marked a significant shift in her ability to self-regulate her emotions. Furthermore, the process of constructing anxiety levels allowed Xiao Liu to gain a clearer understanding of the triggers and intensity of her anxiety, empowering her to approach these situations with greater awareness and control.\n\nThe implementation of systematic desensitization therapy in the third consultation was a pivotal moment in Xiao Liu's journey. By starting with scenarios that elicited the least anxiety and gradually progressing to more challenging situations, Xiao Liu was able to build confidence in her ability to face her fears. This structured approach not only reduced her anxiety but also provided her with a framework for addressing future stressors. The use of natural and familiar scenarios during the simulations facilitated a smoother transition from the therapeutic setting to real-life applications, enhancing the generalizability of the skills learned.\n\nFeedback from Xiao Liu's roommates further corroborated the positive changes observed during the counseling sessions. Their observations of her becoming more cheerful, focused, and engaged in class, as well as developing better relationships with peers, highlighted the broader impact of the therapy beyond the immediate context of exam anxiety. These changes in social interactions are indicative of an improved self-image and greater confidence, which are essential components of overall psychological well-being.\n\nObjective measures, such as the SCL-90 test and self-assessment scales (SAS and SDS), provided quantitative evidence of Xiao Liu's progress. The reduction in scores across these assessments reflected a significant alleviation of anxiety symptoms, confirming the effectiveness of the counseling intervention. However, it is important to acknowledge that while these scores provide valuable data, they do not capture the entirety of Xiao Liu's experience. The subjective narratives and personal growth reported by Xiao Liu are equally crucial in understanding the full scope of her transformation.\n\nThe conclusion of the counseling process marked a significant milestone in Xiao Liu's development. Through a comprehensive review of the sessions, we were able to reflect on the journey and consolidate the gains made. Encouraging Xiao Liu to articulate her experiences and feelings fostered a positive and optimistic attitude towards future exams, reinforcing the importance of maintaining an open dialogue about emotions and coping strategies.\n\nDespite the success of the intervention, the case also highlighted areas for improvement in clinical practice. The absence of follow-up sessions to monitor Xiao Liu's long-term progress and support her continued growth was a notable limitation. In future cases, implementing a structured follow-up plan could provide additional opportunities for reinforcing therapeutic gains and addressing any emerging challenges. Furthermore, enhancing guidance on self-growth and emotional regulation could empower clients to independently navigate future stressors and reduce reliance on external support.\n\nReflecting on Xiao Liu's case has deepened my understanding of the complex interplay between academic pressures, self-perception, and anxiety. It has reinforced the necessity of adopting a holistic approach that addresses not only the symptoms but also the underlying factors contributing to anxiety. This case serves as a reminder of the resilience and potential for growth inherent in every individual, and the transformative power of empathetic and targeted therapeutic interventions.\n\nIn conclusion, the case of Xiao Liu underscores the critical role of counseling in supporting high school students as they navigate the challenges of academic life. By fostering a supportive and understanding environment, clinicians can help students like Xiao Liu develop the skills and confidence needed to face exams and other life challenges with resilience and hope. The insights gained from this case will inform my future practice, guiding me in providing effective and compassionate care to those experiencing similar struggles.", "causes": "Personal personality factors (low self-worth) and social factors (approaching exams, social expectations, academic pressure)", "symptoms": "Exam anxiety", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection;\npsychological assessment and planning;\nSystematic desensitization therapy: intention-guided,\nprogressive muscle relaxation, experience the exam scene step by step and consciously and actively relax the body and mind.", "characteristics_of_illness": "The problem is prevalent due to social norms and family expectations", "treatment_effect": "Negative emotions are released and alleviated, students can look at exams more objectively, master relaxation skills, enhance mental     toughness, improve study efficiency, and improve sleep quality."}

After 20 sessions, her interpersonal communication significantly improved."], "consultation_process": ["Five years ago, she had a conflict with a classmate. In order to protect herself, she turned into a hedgehog. Unexpectedly, the spines hurt others and also pierced through herself. In the prime of her youth, which should have been filled with friends, she found herself utterly alone, silently enduring everything. Five years later, can she shed her spines and walk together with her companions once again? —Prologue\n\n\"Why, why do this to me?\" She asked herself as she covered her face and wept. Tears that had been held back for five years slipped quietly through her fingers, and the pain that had been suppressed for so long finally surged forth in that moment. Her name is Zhang Yan, a freshman at Zhenhai High School, class of 2006. \n\nFive years ago, during a break, 12-year-old Zhang Yan, as cheerful as usual, walked into the classroom, only to be suddenly pushed hard from behind by a boy from her class whom she had never interacted with and could only recognize by name. Zhang Yan was confused and simply shot him a glare, saying nothing. The next day, however, that boy began to insult her, calling her a \"little slut\" in front of many classmates. At that moment, Zhang Yan's mind went blank, as if the world had frozen, and her thoughts came to a standstill. She repeatedly questioned herself about what she had done wrong but could not come up with an answer. To Zhang Yan, such a name must indicate a serious offense for which she was being punished. But what had she done to offend him? What grievances could there be between them? Zhang Yan racked her brain and couldn't figure out what had warranted such retribution, which only deepened her feelings of shame, injustice, anger, and pain. \n\nIn her extreme pain, she chose to suppress herself, hoping that time would heal her wounds and that forgetting would lessen her suffering, but she had never succeeded in these five years. Forcibly forgetting was like pressing a lid on steam, causing it to burst forth instead. In the aftermath, that scene and that voice repeatedly invaded Zhang Yan's dreams, intruding into her mind every time she fell silent, allowing her to experience the same intense pain over and over again. Each time, she would choose to escape. Although every memory was as vivid as when the incident occurred, Zhang Yan could never fully recall the entire event. It seemed as if the incident had torn a white sheet of paper into fragments, and Zhang Yan could not piece them back together, indicating that five years later, she still had not healed from her wounds and thus could not completely escape the shadow of the event. \n\nBefore, Zhang Yan was a confident and cheerful girl. She was intelligent and consistently ranked among the top in her class, winning the favor of her teachers, especially her homeroom teacher, who often held heart-to-heart talks with her in front of the entire class. In the years since the incident, with changes in personnel, we can no longer find the individuals involved back then to ask about the truth of the situation. However, we can speculate that it might have just been a boy's prank, perhaps malicious slander born out of jealousy... Regardless, for five years, she should have been able to move on with the care and support of friends and family. Did Zhang Yan's teachers, parents, and friends know about what had happened? \n\nZhang Yan's father was an ordinary metrologist, and her mother worked in a supermarket. Their family's financial situation was not good, so her mother often did handicrafts in her spare time to supplement the household income. Even so, they were never stingy with their daughter’s expenses, especially her educational costs. Zhang Yan got her own computer in fifth grade, had internet access in sixth grade, and when she wanted an MP3 player in eighth grade, her father took her to buy one right after the high school entrance exam. She had a weak stomach, and the doctor advised her to eat small meals more frequently; every day before school, her parents would prepare snacks like cookies for her. After elementary school, her parents ordered her milk every day without fail. In these small details, Zhang Yan felt her parents' selfless love. However, this love also had a heavy side. Her parents had high expectations for her. For example, when Zhang Yan scored 98 or 99 on exams, her father would ask, \"Why couldn't you get that one or two points?\" When she brought home a perfect score, he merely glanced at it and said, \"Just luck.\" After finishing second in a 100-meter race in elementary school, her father was not pleased and remarked, \"You're so clumsy; you shouldn't have participated in the sports meet.\" Her mother, on the other hand, enjoyed comparing her child's grades with those of her friends' children. Sometimes, Zhang Yan felt like a tool for her parents to show off. But she also felt guilty about this thought, knowing her parents had a hard time. \n\nCompared to their concerns about her grades and life, Zhang Yan felt that her own feelings were always overlooked. Shortly after the incident, she tried to talk to her parents about it at the dinner table. However, her father gave no response, merely casting a bland glance at her, as if to say, \"That's impossible.\" Zhang Yan said, \"After that, I gave up on opening up to acquaintances. My already wounded heart couldn't take another break.\" So she learned to confide in herself, but no matter how hard she tried, she remained unable to escape the shadow of that year. Thus, for five years, Zhang Yan continued to experience this nightmare. And the spines grew in her repeated experiences. \n\nZhang Yan began to doubt the people around her. In her reflections, she wrote, \"After that incident, my social index plummeted to zero.\" Before that, Zhang Yan had been a lively girl, but afterward, she became silent and withdrawn. She feared making friends, worried that \"friends\" might one day turn around and hurt her. To protect herself, Zhang Yan grew spines, and one by one, her classmates began to distance themselves from her, until she was left completely alone. Two years later, by the time she graduated elementary school, she had completely turned into a hedgehog. She said, \"Since then, everything about me has changed; I have become someone I don't even recognize.\" She described herself as a hedgehog that would prick anyone who came near and, like a hedgehog, was cold-blooded. She was sharp-tongued and unyielding, looking down on others with her academic advantages. Whenever there was an opportunity to discuss with classmates, she would insist that she was the only one with the correct answer. She no longer invested her true feelings. \n\nUpon entering middle school, Zhang Yan found herself in an almost entirely new environment (only one of her former elementary school classmates was in her class), and her lonely heart began to call out for friendship again. Due to her excellent academic performance, she was chosen as the vice-class monitor at the start of school. However, after a while, the homeroom teacher noticed that the students had the most complaints about her in their weekly reflections. Classmates reported that she was arrogant and self-centered, not enthusiastic about class affairs or proactive. It turned out that her silence and reserve had long been ingrained in her, and how could she possibly remove her spines all at once? Her old habits resurfaced. In response to strong feedback from her classmates, the homeroom teacher removed her from her class officer position and implemented a \"cold treatment\" strategy to encourage her to reflect on her problems. At the end of the first semester of eighth grade, the homeroom teacher finally had a long talk with her, guiding her on how to interact with others. Zhang Yan's situation improved after this heartfelt discussion. Because of her excellent academic performance, she was appointed as the class's academic committee member in the second year of middle school. This time, she managed class affairs well but still couldn't shake her old habit of being \"overbearing.\" \n\nAfter three years, Zhang Yan still had no friends. She placed her hopes on high school. After entering high school, Zhang Yan got along well with her deskmate at first, and they communicated well. However, after half a month, they had a small conflict—one that might have been easily resolvable in others' eyes but turned into a war between them. Just because her deskmate expressed her displeasure with indifference, Zhang Yan once again revealed her spines. Two days later, they reconciled, but Zhang Yan said she would probably always remember this incident. Indeed, over the past five years, Zhang Yan had developed a unique ability: any small hint of discontent on someone else's face could stir up a tempest within her, leading to conflict. When arguments broke out, Zhang Yan showed no mercy. \n\nEven more unexpectedly, various anecdotes from her middle school days were brought into her new class, causing her to be distanced by her classmates once again. Although she had not yet interacted with many classmates, she had already sensed their indifference and rejection. Within half a month, Zhang Yan withdrew again, becoming silent, introverted, and of course, still capable of pricking others. The spines of a hedgehog are born for self-protection, shields against danger. So to remove the spines, she must feel safety, warmth, and love. She must have not felt heartfelt love for a long time. The trembling heart made her resist coldness and danger with all its might, yet she forgot to feel love, and perhaps that love was too scarce, insufficient to warm her entire heart. \n\nWhen she grasped onto my lifeline, I accepted her. I quietly listened to her story, felt her emotions at the time, and helped her vent the pent-up pain. Thus, the scene at the beginning of this article unfolded. Zhang Yan said that every time she felt sad and wanted to cry, she worried that others would see her and ignore her, so she held back her tears. But this time she cried, and it lasted a long time. Tears have warmth; they are bought with love. However, merely experiencing my concern was not enough to dissolve the ice wall built by her heartache. She needed more warmth from others to melt a heart that had long been frozen. \n\nBecause of her elementary school experience, she unknowingly raised a protective net in front of her heart—thinking of everything in the worst way to avoid too much heartache and disappointment. Over time, this became a habit. This habit made her unsure of how to face others' affection when it came. Occasionally, some girls would extend a friendly hand to her, but she, already on high alert, didn't know how to respond. She feared that this friendly face might suddenly change the next day, and that would hurt her even more. I encouraged her, saying it was just a matter of choice. When you choose to embrace, you might gain a friendship. If they changed, then they were never really your friends, and you had nothing to lose. The key was the courage in her heart. I asked her if she wanted to change, and she nodded. \n\nSo I asked her if she wanted to learn to \"embrace\" (friendship), and she hesitantly asked if she could choose, picking those she liked. Because she feared being too sensitive and turning back into a hedgehog over the slightest issue, I nodded in agreement. There were several girls at the back of the class who greeted her warmly every time they saw her, but she didn't know how to respond. So I first taught Zhang Yan how to respond to greetings. I instructed her to lift her eyelids (Zhang Yan was afraid to look others in the eye, so her eyelids tended to droop) and smile, simply saying \"Hi.\" \"Is it that simple?\" \"Yes, it's that simple.\" This was also to stimulate her confidence, so I chose a straightforward approach. Zhang Yan did very well and discovered that her smile was beautiful. Of course, teaching her this was because love needs to be reciprocated. Without that, Zhang Yan might really never see anyone \"reaching out\" to her again. \n\nWhen Zhang Yan did this, she realized that wanting to smile was not difficult; she hadn't smiled at anyone in a long time. But with those friendly classmates, she found that she could smile naturally without forcing herself. Next, I told her that if she could sensitively perceive the needs of her classmates and strive to meet those needs, it would be easier to leave a good impression on others. So at the sports meet, Zhang Yan signed up for the 800-meter run, even though her health wasn't great; this solved a significant problem for the class monitor. At the end of the long run, two girls were there to support her (Zhang Yan was worried that no one would come to help her because she didn't have many friends), and she felt very warm. Upon returning to the classroom, Zhang Yan felt less repressed. Her spines began to gradually recede. \n\nThen, I told her to seize the opportunity to showcase herself, \"Give those who don’t know you yet a chance to understand you, and then you will have the opportunity to change the impression you leave on others.\" Hearing this, Zhang Yan hesitated, worried that if she didn't do well, she might invite ridicule. But with my encouragement, she decided to give it a try. Later, Zhang Yan was invited to participate in a singing competition at the broadcasting station. The literature committee member said it would be a shame not to use her beautiful voice. She was afraid and hesitant but didn't let her habitual negative thoughts defeat her, saying, \"If you can accompany me, I will go.\" That girl agreed, and Zhang Yan was very happy. In that competition, Zhang Yan received the third-highest number of votes (out of six participants). Since this was the result of votes from the entire school after listening to the broadcast, it greatly boosted her confidence. \n\nNext, we should be grateful for the many collective activities organized by the school. On the evening of December 8, there was a collective dance competition for the first-year students, requiring 20 participants from each class. When the announcement was made, Zhang Yan thought she had no chance because she was under 160 cm tall, but unexpectedly, after some twists and turns, she was invited to join the team. While practicing with everyone, Zhang Yan smiled happily, her face radiant. As the instructor (a classmate) helped her adjust her posture step by step, Zhang Yan was very cooperative. At this moment, who would have thought of her previous \"overbearing and unyielding\" demeanor? Her spines had completely receded because there was no danger, only warmth, and the spines had lost their purpose. In that competition, Zhang Yan's class won second place. \n\nWhen Zhang Yan next visited my office, she was no longer filled with past resentment but instead smiled while sharing the stories of the week (we had agreed to meet once a week for guidance), and she could finally look me in the eye; those eyes were bright. The next question from Zhang Yan was, \"Now that I know how to respond to others, how do I 'reach out' to others?\" It seemed she had developed the desire and idea to initiate interactions with others. This change was so precious and delightful! I affirmed her progress and told her that when she had heard enough cheers and applause and gained enough confidence, she would naturally know how to \"reach out.\" \n\nAfter that, Zhang Yan progressed at an almost unimaginable speed, talking less about her troubles and worries in socializing and starting to discuss studies, movies, literature... As the topics widened, I knew it was time to end our sessions. Due to the increasing academic pressure, Zhang Yan agreed to conclude our meetings but hoped to consult the school psychologist in the future (which is certainly valid, as the school psychologist will always provide support when needed). That evening, as the sun had not yet set, during the most beautiful moment of the sunset, Zhang Yan left. \n\nNow, Zhang Yan is a freshman at Zhejiang Normal University, and she aspires to be a teacher. She will use her knowledge and spirit to inspire more people, bringing warmth and hope to others. I remember that Christmas, she gave me a gift—a set of message bottles. Inside the smallest bottle, there was a tiny piece of paper that read: \"You are like this message bottle, carrying my hopes and dreams in the real world. Thank you, teacher!\""], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on Zhang Yan's journey is a poignant reminder of the transformative power of psychotherapy when it is met with the client's readiness and determination to change. Zhang Yan's case highlights the intricate interplay between internal struggles and external validation, a dynamic that played a crucial role in her recovery from social anxiety disorder.\n\nThe initial catalyst for Zhang Yan's social anxiety was an unfortunate incident in her fifth-grade classroom. The abrupt humiliation she experienced, coupled with a lack of immediate emotional support, triggered a profound internal conflict. This event acted as a seed, embedding itself deeply within her psyche, and over the years, it grew into a pervasive fear of social interactions. Her experience underscores the critical importance of addressing emotional traumas as they arise, rather than allowing them to fester unattended.\n\nZhang Yan's story also illustrates the significant impact of family dynamics on a young person's emotional development. Despite her parents' material support and high expectations for her academic success, there was a noticeable absence of emotional attunement. Zhang Yan's parents, perhaps inadvertently, prioritized her achievements over her emotional wellbeing, failing to provide the empathy and understanding she desperately needed. This gap in emotional connection left Zhang Yan feeling isolated and misunderstood, reinforcing her belief that she needed to rely solely on herself for emotional support.\n\nIn our therapeutic sessions, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) served as a fundamental tool for helping Zhang Yan reconstruct her cognitive framework around interpersonal interactions. Through CBT, we explored the automatic thoughts and deep-seated beliefs that had taken root since her traumatic experience. Zhang Yan learned to identify these cognitive distortions and replace them with more balanced and realistic appraisals. This cognitive restructuring was a painstaking process, requiring her to confront long-held fears and misconceptions about herself and others.\n\nOne of the most powerful moments in our sessions was when Zhang Yan allowed herself to cry openly for the first time in years. Her tears were a testament to the pent-up pain and vulnerability she had kept hidden for so long. In that moment, Zhang Yan began to dismantle the protective barriers she had built around her heart. It was a cathartic release that marked the beginning of her emotional thawing. This experience reinforced the therapeutic principle that emotional expression, when met with empathy and understanding, can be profoundly healing.\n\nThe therapeutic journey also involved practical steps to enhance Zhang Yan's social skills. We practiced simple yet effective strategies, such as making eye contact, smiling, and responding to greetings. These seemingly small actions were monumental for Zhang Yan, as they represented a shift from avoidance to engagement. As she began to implement these skills, Zhang Yan discovered that her fears were often unfounded and that many of her classmates were receptive to her overtures. This realization was pivotal, as it challenged her belief that she was destined to be rejected.\n\nZhang Yan's participation in school activities further facilitated her social reintegration. Engaging in collective endeavors, such as the singing competition and the dance team, provided her with opportunities to connect with peers in a shared context. These experiences not only boosted her confidence but also allowed her to experience the warmth of camaraderie and support. They were crucial in dismantling the hedgehog spines she had developed as a defense mechanism. The success she achieved in these activities validated her efforts and reinforced the positive changes she was making.\n\nAs I reflect on Zhang Yan's progress, I am reminded of the importance of creating a therapeutic environment that fosters trust and safety. Zhang Yan's initial hesitation to trust others, including myself, was a testament to the deep-seated fear she harbored. Building a therapeutic alliance based on genuine care and empathy was essential in helping her feel secure enough to explore her vulnerabilities. It was through this relationship that Zhang Yan found the courage to confront her fears and begin the process of healing.\n\nZhang Yan's story also serves as a powerful reminder of the impact that seemingly small gestures of kindness can have. The warmth and encouragement she received from her classmates played a significant role in her recovery. It highlights the importance of fostering a supportive and inclusive community, where individuals feel valued and understood. As clinicians, educators, and peers, we have a responsibility to create environments that nurture emotional resilience and encourage open communication.\n\nThe journey of healing is rarely linear, and Zhang Yan's path was no exception. There were setbacks and moments of doubt, yet each step forward was a testament to her resilience and determination. Her ability to transform her fear into courage and her isolation into connection is a testament to the human capacity for growth and change.\n\nAs I think about Zhang Yan's future, I am filled with hope and admiration. Her aspiration to become a teacher speaks volumes about her desire to use her experiences to inspire and support others. It is a powerful reminder that our struggles can become our strengths, and our vulnerabilities can become our greatest sources of empathy and connection.\n\nIn closing, Zhang Yan's case has left an indelible mark on my practice as a clinician. It has reinforced the importance of listening deeply, providing unwavering support, and nurturing the seeds of hope and change in those we serve. Her journey is a testament to the transformative power of love, understanding, and the human spirit. As I continue my work, I carry with me the lessons learned from Zhang Yan's story, and the profound understanding that healing is not only possible but can lead to a brighter and more connected future.", "causes": "Early traumatic events and social factors (inadequate parental psychological support)", "symptoms": "Social anxiety", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection;\nCognitive-behavioral therapy: cognitive adjustment and social skills imparting.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Personality changes caused by verbal abuse and lack of\nimmediate emotional support in primary school", "treatment_effect": "Negative emotions are released and alleviated, students can look at exams more objectively, master relaxation skills, enhance mental     toughness, improve study efficiency, and improve sleep quality."}
{"id": 22, "case_description": ["The seeker, a 23-year-old female company employee, had a disagreement with her fiancé regarding the issue of giving gifts to relatives and friends before their engagement. The fiancé proposed to break up, while she wanted to mend the relationship but was rejected by him. Feeling down and crying, she took leave from work and has been unable to work for over a month. She visited a psychiatrist, who prescribed antidepressants, but after taking them, her condition did not improve and instead worsened. Her family believes it is a psychological issue and advised her to seek counseling. After making an appointment with me, she came accompanied by her father. The father privately informed me that they do not agree with the marriage either; it was the daughter who insisted on it. Now that the fiancé has regrets and the relationship cannot be repaired, the daughter is struggling to cope with this situation."], "consultation_process": ["First consultation: I introduced myself simply to the seeker, sincerely and warmly empathizing with her to gain her trust and establish a good counseling relationship. After that, she opened her heart and began to share her troubles. Her boyfriend was a classmate from high school, in the same grade but different classes. Back then, she developed a crush on him because he was handsome. Later, she found out he was dating her close friend, who was in the same class as her. Although she felt a bit disappointed, she still wished them well. Eventually, for some unknown reason, they broke up. After that, all three of them got accepted into different universities, and she had no contact with him during that time. After graduating from college and shortly after finding a job, one day her boyfriend suddenly appeared in front of her, which made her ecstatic since he was the person she had secretly liked for many years. Thus, they began dating. He would pick her up and drop her off from work every day, buy her breakfast, and whenever he got his salary, he would buy her things she liked. Over two years, she felt warm and sweet; although they sometimes argued, they quickly made up. The girl came from a well-off family, while the boy's family was less fortunate—his father had passed away early, and his mother was bedridden, cared for by his three older sisters. After they started dating, the seeker occasionally helped take care of him on her days off, and he was very grateful. Recently, the boy's company took on a big project far away, and he had to work there for a while, possibly one or two years. They discussed informing both families and setting a wedding date. The seeker’s parents were not pleased with the boy’s family background, but for their daughter’s sake, they reluctantly agreed to the marriage. They discussed that since the boy had no money, he borrowed 30,000 yuan from a friend to give to the seeker as a meeting gift. She accepted it in front of him, pretending to be gracious, and planned to secretly pay him back later. They chose a decent restaurant to treat relatives and friends, but they disagreed on how to return gifts to the relatives. The seeker insisted on giving two packs of cigarettes to each family, reasoning that this was the norm when relatives' children got engaged, while the boy only agreed to return two boxes of cigarettes. After several negotiations without compromise, they had a big fight. In a fit of rage, the seeker slapped the boy, and they both suggested breaking up. Later, the seeker regretted it and wanted to win him back. She chased after the train he took to work in another city, but he ignored her and made her get off halfway. Now, he doesn’t answer her calls, WeChat messages, or emails. The seeker felt guilty, remorseful, and disappointed; she had been in pain for over a month and sought help to find a way to repair their relationship. After listening to her story, I expressed understanding of her pain, supported her idea of mending their relationship, and her emotions slightly improved.\n\nSecond consultation: The seeker told me that during this period, she wrote three letters to her boyfriend. The first was a letter recalling their sweet moments together, hoping it would make him feel nostalgic and change his mind; the second was an apology letter admitting her mistake for slapping him and vowing to change; she no longer cared about the cigarette issue and agreed to do as he suggested; the third was a letter envisioning their beautiful future together, to give him hope for their relationship. Unfortunately, none of them received a reply. The seeker also texted her boyfriend's mentor, asking him to persuade him, but the mentor said the boy did not want to continue. She also visited the boy's second sister, who usually managed the household, but they had a disagreement and ended up arguing. The sister scolded the seeker for being shameless, to which the seeker cried and responded that they had been in a relationship for over two years without ever having sexual relations, so how could she be shameless? The sister retorted that the seeker had spent a lot of the boy’s money. The seeker ran home in tears. I patiently listened to her. It was evident that although her efforts were ineffective, they helped alleviate her emotions, and she was no longer in such pain, actively thinking of ways to solve the problem.\n\nThird consultation: The seeker told me she wanted to go far away to find him, firstly to repay him for the money he had spent on her over the past two years, and secondly to discuss things face-to-face again. Although her father disagreed, she was determined. So, before she left, I designed a psychological play to rehearse what to say and how to act when they met, writing down the lines. Her aunt accompanied her on the trip. The seeker bought many of the boy's favorite foods, hurriedly bought a plane ticket, and together with her aunt, flew off to find him. According to her, the situation was similar to our rehearsal. At the construction site entrance, she met the boy, who was with his mentor. He first asked how she got there, and upon learning she flew, he remarked on their lavishness. After receiving the money, he still seemed very resolute, showing no willingness to reconcile. The seeker was very disappointed and had no intention of staying even for a moment. She bought a train ticket, which included a standing ticket, and took over thirty hours to return.\n\nFourth consultation: The seeker reported to me about the meeting, and at that moment, I confirmed the information her father had given me; it was clear that the relationship could not be repaired, and accepting the breakup became the focus of our next consultation. My first angle of discussion was their differing values. While their relationship had been warm and sweet, when it came to marriage and involving two families, the clash of values caused conflicts. The boy was frugal, while the girl was compromising and accommodating, leading to a change in their interaction patterns, which was my second angle of discussion. Analyzing these two aspects began to shift the seeker’s mindset; the “perfect him” she had in her heart gradually transformed, and she started to doubt her impression of him, recognizing his flaws.\n\nFifth consultation: The seeker recounted that during this period, an important event occurred. One evening, she felt extremely painful and nearly unbearable. Reflecting on the entire situation, she believed her boyfriend's breakup was related to her parents' earlier opposition. She thought that if her parents hadn't objected, he might not have broken up with her. Unable to control herself, she had a big fight with her parents, who were hesitant to say anything since they could see she was upset. After the uproar, she stormed out and did not return home that night, staying in a hotel. At that moment, a sense of nameless loneliness washed over her, and she thought of her boyfriend. Holding onto a final shred of hope, she texted him: if he didn't come back to see her, she would commit suicide. Still, there was no reply. Desperate, she picked up a small knife and made a shallow cut on her arm; the pain was unbearable, but she stopped. The wound was not deep, and there was little bleeding. In a panic, she hurriedly called her aunt. Her family rushed over and quickly took her to the hospital, taking turns to look after her. Two days later, she was discharged. I took this opportunity to help her analyze her boyfriend's character flaws: he was too indifferent. Even in her life-threatening moment of contemplating suicide for him, he remained unmoved. Did he truly love her? Did he still have feelings for her? With such traits as indifference, decisiveness, stinginess, and stubbornness, did she really like him? Considering her emotions were still quite low, I employed acceptance and commitment therapy, teaching her how to coexist with her emotions. After the session, she signed a no-suicide agreement, and I informed her father to ensure family members accompanied her 24 hours a day to avoid triggering her and prevent another suicide attempt.\n\nSixth consultation: The seeker began to accept the reality of the breakup and to face her boyfriend more realistically. I started to help her analyze why this situation arose. First, their living environments were different: her family was relatively affluent, while the boy's father had passed away early, and his family was poor, relying on his sisters for support. Such differing environments led to a clash of values, which in turn caused conflict. Their personalities were mismatched; the seeker was outgoing and generous, while the boy was stubborn and indifferent. In terms of their interaction pattern, it was important to discuss issues; if one felt they were right, they had to stand firm instead of continually accommodating the other. If they entered marriage carrying these issues, it would lead to problems.\n\nSeventh consultation: The seeker’s cognition and emotions gradually improved, and she reconnected with her high school best friend. Out of embarrassment over dating her boyfriend, she had avoided contacting her friend, especially since they had previously dated. The friend informed her that after breaking up with her, the boy dated someone else but ended it when they were about to discuss marriage. After spending more than two months at home, she wanted to return to work. I suggested that once she returned to work, chatting with colleagues and friends would help change her mood.\n\nEighth consultation: The seeker started working again, and her mood gradually improved. She discussed what kind of partner she should look for next. I conducted a “relationship type test” for her. The seeker’s relationship type was a writer with spiritual qualities—empathetic, a good listener, and fond of reading and writing. Based on her expectations for an ideal partner, his general personality traits would be: determined, persistent, stubborn, competitive, and driven; his potential communication style might be directive or commanding; his positive traits would include focus on achieving goals and willingness to take responsibility; possible issues might involve underestimating authority and rules. The seeker expressed gratitude, thanking me for accompanying her over the past month and appreciating the personal growth she experienced during the counseling process."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on this case, I find myself drawn to the intricate interplay of emotions, values, and interpersonal dynamics that defined the seeker’s journey. This case, though seemingly centered on a romantic breakup, delves deeply into the broader psychological implications of attachment, identity, and growth. In the initial stages of our consultation, it was clear that the seeker was engulfed by emotional turmoil. Her inability to accept the breakup was not just about losing a partner; it was about confronting a fundamental dissonance between her expectations and reality. This dissonance was primarily rooted in differing value systems, an aspect I recognized but knew required careful handling to bring to her conscious awareness.\n\nFrom the outset, I adopted a strategy of empathetic engagement, recognizing the importance of creating a safe space for her to express her feelings. This approach was not just about offering comfort but also about building a therapeutic alliance that would enable her to explore painful emotions without fear of judgment. It was crucial for her to feel validated in her distress, as invalidating these emotions could have closed off communication and deepened her sense of isolation. By supporting her initial desire to mend the relationship, I positioned myself not as an adversary to her wishes but as a companion on her journey toward self-discovery and healing.\n\nAs the consultations progressed, I noted the evolution of the dynamics between her and her former partner. Her narrative painted a picture of a relationship where she was often accommodating, while he remained steadfast in his ways. This imbalance was not just a personal quirk but a manifestation of their deeply ingrained value systems. She came from a background of relative affluence and openness, which fostered her generous and outgoing nature. In contrast, his upbringing in a less fortunate environment may have shaped his frugality and stubbornness. Understanding these backgrounds was essential in dissecting the conflict, allowing the seeker to see that their disagreements were not merely personal failings but reflections of their life experiences.\n\nThe third consultation introduced the concept of psychodrama, a technique designed to mentally prepare the seeker for potential outcomes. This rehearsal was not just about scripting her words but about empowering her to face the emotional reality of her situation. It was an exercise in confronting her fears and hopes, enabling her to navigate the potential pain of rejection with greater resilience. This approach, while supportive, also subtly guided her toward accepting that reconciliation might not be possible, a realization that needed to come from within rather than from external persuasion.\n\nThe pivotal moment arrived during the fifth consultation when the seeker’s desperation led her to contemplate suicide. This was a critical juncture, both in her personal journey and in our therapeutic relationship. Her act of self-harm, though not severely injurious, was a cry for help, a manifestation of her inner turmoil and perceived loss of control. It was imperative to address this crisis with immediacy and sensitivity. The no-suicide agreement served as a tangible commitment to her safety, reinforcing the notion that her life held intrinsic value beyond her relationship status. This intervention was coupled with a shift in our discussions, focusing more on her boyfriend’s character traits and questioning whether these aligned with her long-term happiness.\n\nThrough these discussions, she began to dismantle the idealized image of her boyfriend, confronting the reality of his indifference and stubbornness. This was a transformative moment, as it allowed her to recalibrate her understanding of love and partnership. She started to see that a fulfilling relationship required mutual respect and adaptability, qualities that seemed absent in her previous relationship. This cognitive shift was crucial in alleviating her depressive symptoms, as it redirected her focus from what she had lost to what she had learned.\n\nBy the sixth consultation, our focus shifted to analyzing the reasons for the breakup more deeply. This involved a comprehensive examination of their personalities, values, and interaction patterns. It was important for the seeker to understand that their differences were not just obstacles but also opportunities for learning and growth. She needed to see that her outgoing and empathetic nature was not a liability but a strength that could flourish in the right relational context. This understanding helped her redefine her self-worth independent of her past relationship, setting the stage for personal growth.\n\nAs the seeker reconnected with her high school friend, she started to reintegrate into her social world, shedding the isolation that had characterized the earlier stages of her breakup. This reconnection was not just about socializing but about reclaiming her identity and agency. Her decision to return to work signaled a readiness to reengage with life, a positive indicator of her emotional recovery. This transition marked a turning point where the focus of our consultations shifted from processing the past to envisioning the future.\n\nThe introduction of the “relationship type test” in the eighth consultation was a strategic move to help her conceptualize the kind of partner that would complement her personality. By exploring the traits she valued, we created a framework for her to assess future relationships more critically. This exercise was not about prescribing a partner but about empowering her to make informed choices, reinforcing her agency in shaping her romantic future.\n\nReflecting on this case, I am reminded of the complexity of human relationships and the profound impact they have on our psychological well-being. The seeker’s journey was not just about overcoming a breakup; it was about redefining her identity and values in the context of love and partnership. As a clinician, I learned the importance of balancing empathy with guidance, allowing the seeker to find her path while providing the support needed to navigate emotional turbulence. This case reaffirmed my belief in the resilience of the human spirit and the transformative power of psychotherapy in facilitating personal growth and healing.", "causes": "Social factors (breakdown of intimacy)", "symptoms": "Self-injury, depression", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection;\nHumanistic therapy: listening, empathy, value exploration, etc.;\nSitcom therapy: rehearsing the conversation with your broken boyfriend in advance; Acceptance & Commitment Therapy: Living with emotions and exploring partner types.", "characteristics_of_illness": "There are big differences in the family conditions and\nvalues of the two sides", "treatment_effect": "Gradually accept the fact of the breakup, understand the root\ncause of the conflict between the two parties, focus on the present,\nand make initial exploration and basic preparations for the next life and intimate relationship."}

Consultation objective: How to solve my long-term depression and insomnia issues?", "IV. Consultation Process: This is the client's first consultation. The client first discusses her issue of insomnia. She then starts talking about her romantic relationship and marriage. Her marriage was arranged by her parents, which she was not very willing to accept. In fact, she was not really attracted to her husband, even though he graduated from a key university and works in the provincial capital. However, her husband is relatively short, only 1.7 meters tall, while she is quite outstanding in terms of both figure and appearance. At that time, her husband was quite eager to marry her. The client says that she married to please her parents, thinking that if it didn't work out, they could just get divorced. However, she got pregnant shortly after getting married!

After getting pregnant, she didn't dare to express her cravings due to pregnancy symptoms. Her husband is not around, coming back once every half month or month. She feels very lonely and needs care and concern. However, she doesn't receive it; even when her husband comes home, she feels he doesn't care about her. The visitor mentioned that she developed insomnia after giving birth. For three days and nights after giving birth, she couldn't close her eyes and felt scared. Sleeping alone makes her feel frightened (where does this feeling of fear come from?). After giving birth, her husband stayed at home for a month, but after the baby was a month old, he went back to work. Her insomnia became more severe. In fact, she was suffering from depression at that time, but she didn't realize it. Every day at 1 PM, she would regularly experience headaches and nausea. Her husband is the youngest, and after they got married, they lived with her in-laws, along with his two brothers and sisters-in-law and other family members, which became overwhelming for her. However, out of concern for her image, she felt embarrassed to speak up. With her husband not around, she had no emotional support and focused all her attention on the child. (However, during the interview, the visitor rarely talked about her child; only at the end did she relay her daughter's assessment of her mother's issues: her mother's illness is due to a lack of love!) The inner pain she feels is something she never dares to share with outsiders due to her concern for her image, fearing it would reach her in-laws' ears. Others might think she is quite happy.", "In fact, the visitor is very afraid to go home because her father-in-law always has a serious expression and is very stern. Perhaps it is this personality that makes the visitor feel very oppressed at home. In 2004, she finally bought a house in the provincial capital, and the family was reunited. That year was the most comfortable year for the visitor, but the following year, her in-laws moved in to live with them. Both her father-in-law and mother-in-law are over seventy years old, and her father-in-law is in poor health, suffering from stomach cancer. They require care for their daily living, which makes the visitor feel constantly irritable and emotionally blocked. The visitor describes her husband as a soft-hearted person. She complains that he is an irresponsible man with no ambition, who does not take initiative to solve problems and instead relies on others, which makes her very disappointed. He is unable to handle any matters well. (This is what the visitor later realized as \"generalizing from the specific and jumping to conclusions\"!)

Reading has made her realize that depression stems from flawed thinking patterns, and therefore, it cannot be cured just by taking medication. She often deals with problems using a negative thought process, which exacerbates her depressive feelings. She has been trying the methods in the book; when a thought arises, she attempts to reflect by questioning herself, and as a result, her mood has improved! Moreover, she tends to generalize when evaluating her husband. For instance, when her husband accompanies her to the hospital and gets lost, she dismisses him as completely incompetent and inadequate, making the error of \"hasty generalization and jumping to conclusions.\" However, when her daughter makes the same mistake as her husband, she does not blame her daughter in the same way she blames her husband.", "5. Personal Analysis: The visitor's thought pattern is characterized by worrying and anxiety about everything, which is also reflected in her approach to parenting. It is precisely because \"she focuses all her attention on the child\" that issues related to raising the child cause her particular worry and anxiety. This may be the reason she has been suffering from insomnia since giving birth!"], "experience_and_reflection": "The consultation with the client illuminated several complex and interwoven issues, primarily revolving around depression, anxiety, and the impact of entrenched thinking patterns on her mental health. This case reflects a profound intersection between personal history, familial relationships, and cognitive patterns, which appear to perpetuate the client's emotional distress. In this reflection, I will delve deeper into the intricate layers of the client's experiences and the insights gained from our session, offering a comprehensive analysis of the therapeutic journey thus far.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of the client's narrative is the profound sense of isolation and lack of emotional support, which seems to underpin much of her depressive and anxious symptomatology. The client's marriage, arranged by her parents, set the stage for a relationship characterized by emotional disconnection. Despite her husband's educational background and stable job, the client never felt a genuine attraction or emotional bond with him. This initial lack of emotional attachment appears to have been compounded by the physical distance due to her husband's job, which left her feeling lonely and unsupported during crucial moments, such as her pregnancy and early motherhood.\n\nThe client's insomnia, which began after childbirth, could be seen as a somatic expression of her deep-seated anxiety and fear. Her description of being unable to close her eyes for three days and nights post-delivery suggests an acute stress response, likely exacerbated by her husband's absence and the overwhelming presence of her in-laws. Living with a large extended family, including her stern father-in-law, only intensified her feelings of oppression and helplessness. Her inability to voice her discomfort due to concerns about her image highlights a recurrent theme of self-imposed silence and suppression of emotions, further contributing to her mental health struggles.\n\nThe client's revelation about her extramarital affair adds another layer of complexity to her emotional landscape. The affair, which provided temporary solace and a sense of being cared for, ultimately led to increased anxiety when the relationship with her cousin became strained. This situation mirrors her earlier experiences of emotional neglect, reinforcing the pattern of seeking external validation to fill the void left by her husband's perceived indifference. Her guilt and self-blame for her cousin's subsequent personal troubles illustrate a tendency towards self-directed negative thinking, a hallmark of her depressive cognition.\n\nReading \"The New Emotional Therapy\" by David Burns has been a pivotal turning point for the client, offering her a new perspective on her depression and anxiety. The book's emphasis on cognitive restructuring aligns well with the collaborative-oriented dialogue therapy approach, which aims to deconstruct maladaptive thought patterns. The client's newfound awareness of her tendency towards negative thinking and hasty generalizations, particularly in her evaluation of her husband, marks a significant step towards cognitive change. She recognizes that her perception of her husband as wholly inadequate stems from a cognitive distortion, and she is beginning to challenge these automatic thoughts.\n\nOur consultation also highlighted the client's pervasive worry and anxiety, especially concerning her role as a mother. Her intense focus on her child, while providing a sense of purpose, has also been a source of immense stress. The responsibility of child-rearing, compounded by her husband's lack of involvement, has led her to develop rigid expectations of how care should be administered. Her frustration with her husband's perceived incompetence in handling the child reflects her broader struggle with relinquishing control and accepting differing parenting styles.\n\nThe client's recent commitment to introspection and self-help strategies suggests a burgeoning resilience and willingness to change. Her efforts to document changes in her thinking and the impact of reading Burns' book indicate a proactive approach to her mental health. This self-reflection is crucial in the therapeutic process, as it empowers the client to recognize the link between her thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, fostering a sense of agency and hope for recovery.\n\nIn reflecting on the consultation process, it is evident that establishing a trusting therapeutic relationship was paramount. The client's openness in sharing sensitive information, such as her affair and family dynamics, signifies a foundational level of trust and safety within the therapeutic space. This trust is essential for facilitating deeper exploration of her cognitive and emotional patterns, enabling her to gradually reconstruct her narrative in a more adaptive and compassionate manner.\n\nThe client's case underscores the importance of addressing cognitive distortions and fostering emotional awareness in the treatment of depression and anxiety.

Through the method of introspective mindset healing, we aim to foster a deep understanding and reconciliation in these relationships, which often act as hidden yet potent stressors in the lives of young couples. Upon further reflection and clinical analysis, several key dimensions of this introspective journey have emerged, enhancing our understanding of how these familial bonds can transform from sources of tension to wells of support and affection.\n\nOne of the foundational insights is the transformative power of introspection in discovering and rekindling the often-overlooked love that underpins these relationships. Many young adults, particularly those who grew up as only children, have been raised in environments where they are the focal point of familial attention and resources. This upbringing can inadvertently cultivate a self-centric worldview, which clashes with the complex family dynamics post-marriage. Prior to marriage, there might be an unconscious expectation that the mother-in-law will exhibit the same unconditional love and indulgence as their own mothers. However, the reality is often starkly different, leading to feelings of alienation and resentment. Through focused introspection, individuals can reexamine and reconstruct their narratives, bringing to light the instances of genuine care and support offered by their mothers-in-law that have been overshadowed by negative emotions. This process not only highlights the love that exists but also shifts the locus of conflict from the external to the internal. By acknowledging the roots of their own dissatisfaction, individuals can begin to dissolve long-held grievances, enabling a shift towards empathy and gratitude. Such a realization acts as a catalyst for inner growth, fostering traits of tolerance, humility, and acceptance.\n\nMoreover, introspection provides a valuable lens through which individuals can critique their own behavior and attitudes. The generational gap, exacerbated by cultural and informational disparities, often creates a communication chasm between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law. Younger generations, with their exposure to diverse ideas and technologies, may view their elders as outdated, challenging their authority and wisdom. This disparity, combined with a heightened sense of entitlement to express their opinions, can lead to friction when their voices are not heard or validated. Through deliberate self-reflection, participants can critically assess their interactions and recognize patterns of stubbornness or insensitivity that may contribute to these conflicts. This newfound self-awareness can induce feelings of remorse and motivate a more considerate approach, paving the way for a more harmonious relationship. Understanding the genuine intentions behind their mother-in-law’s actions can transform perceptions of criticism into opportunities for personal growth and mutual respect.\n\nThe process of self-reflection also illuminates the internalized pressures of modern education, which often instills a relentless pursuit of success and a fear of failure. These ingrained beliefs can create resistance when confronted with differing opinions or practices from their mothers-in-law, often perceived as antiquated or restrictive. By reflecting on these interactions, individuals can appreciate the value of the wisdom and traditions their mothers-in-law bring, recognizing them not as barriers but as enriching perspectives that complement their own. Acknowledging the diligent efforts and sacrifices made by their mothers-in-law, especially during pivotal life moments like childbirth, can awaken a profound sense of responsibility and appreciation, bridging the gap between different life experiences and values. This awareness fosters a climate of mutual respect and understanding, where both parties can learn and grow together.\n\nAnother critical aspect of introspection is its capacity to elevate and enlighten the soul, transcending the immediate familial context to touch upon broader themes of human connection and love. The relationship between a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law is unique, blending elements of familial affection with friendship. By delving deep into the dynamics of giving and receiving within this relationship, individuals can gain insights into the fundamental essence of love. This awareness helps dismantle subconscious barriers of rejection and defensiveness, encouraging open-hearted communication and cooperation. As individuals embrace the reality of being both givers and receivers of love, they cultivate an environment where mutual respect and warmth can flourish, transforming potential sources of conflict into opportunities for genuine connection and shared joy.\n\nThese insights underscore the efficacy of introspection in addressing the intricate dynamics of mother-in-law and daughter-in-law relationships. By unearthing the latent love and understanding within these bonds, introspection not only resolves interpersonal conflicts but also contributes to the broader goal of family harmony. As demonstrated in this study, the changes induced by introspection are gradual, requiring sustained effort and reflection. Extending the follow-up period and including other closely related individuals in this process can further amplify its benefits, offering a comprehensive approach to fostering familial peace and understanding. This journey of introspection not only heals personal relationships but also enriches the participants’ overall emotional landscape, equipping them with the tools to navigate the complexities of human interactions with grace and empathy.\n\nIn conclusion, the introspective approach to resolving mother-in-law and daughter-in-law conflicts reveals profound truths about love, identity, and human connection. As individuals embark on this journey of self-discovery and healing, they unlock the potential for deep personal growth and relational transformation. Through the lens of introspection, we come to understand that the true power of healing lies not in altering others, but in changing our own perceptions and responses. This realization, coupled with the courage to face and embrace our vulnerabilities, paves the way for a future where familial relationships are defined by empathy, understanding, and love.", "causes": "Social factors (mother-in-law and daughter-in-law have a discordant relationship)", "symptoms": "Interpersonal distress", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection;\nHumanistic therapy: listening, empathy, etc.;\nIntrospective Therapy: Thinking about what you and others are giving and gaining within a set time.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Conflicts caused by the \"generation gap\".", "treatment_effect": "Re-examining the impact of the contributions of elders and the  limitations of the times has strengthened gratitude and forgiveness, and improved communication."}

Initially, Xiaoxi's presentation in the counseling room indicated a heightened sensitivity to her environment, characterized by her observant nature and initial nervousness. This sensitivity seemed to mirror her broader life experiences, where her introverted personality often led to a heightened awareness of her surroundings and an acute responsiveness to external pressures, such as academic expectations and familial hopes.\n\nFrom the onset, Xiaoxi's case was marked by her persistent exam anxiety, a condition exacerbated by past academic disappointments, particularly her college entrance examination experience. This past failure, though eventually overcome, left a lingering imprint on her psyche, manifesting as a fear of inadequacy and failure. Her academic diligence and the expectations placed upon her by herself and her environment contributed to a perfectionistic mindset, making her particularly vulnerable to the pressures of upcoming graduate exams. This was a critical factor in her anxiety, as the anticipation of similar stakes triggered a resurgence of past fears.\n\nIn our counseling sessions, it became evident that Xiaoxi's anxiety was not rooted in a lack of ability but rather in her cognitive appraisal of her circumstances. Her narrative revealed a pattern of self-doubt and an internal dialogue filled with critical self-assessment, which amplified her stress responses. The consultation process aimed to address these cognitive distortions by utilizing systematic desensitization, a behavioral therapy that not only targeted her exam-related anxiety but also sought to reshape her self-perception.\n\nSystematic desensitization provided a structured framework for Xiaoxi to confront her fears incrementally. This method involved imagining anxiety-provoking scenarios in a controlled manner while maintaining a state of relaxation, thereby gradually reducing her anxiety response. The counseling sessions were carefully paced, ensuring that Xiaoxi could visualize each scenario without overwhelming anxiety, a process which required her to harness relaxation techniques effectively. The progression through these scenarios was pivotal in altering her conditioned responses to exam-related stimuli.\n\nThe counseling process also emphasized the importance of relaxation training. Teaching Xiaoxi self-relaxation techniques was not merely about managing immediate anxiety but also about empowering her with a lifelong skill. As Xiaoxi became adept at inducing a state of calm, she reported improvements in sleep quality and overall well-being, suggesting that relaxation had become a valuable tool in her daily life.\n\nA significant turning point in the therapy was the exploration of Xiaoxi's self-concept and her reflections on others' evaluations of her academic performance. By discussing how she perceived herself through the lens of external feedback, we uncovered a core issue: her self-worth was heavily contingent on academic success. This realization was crucial, as it allowed Xiaoxi to begin the process of redefining her self-worth independent of external achievements. Through guided self-reflection, Xiaoxi started to recognize her intrinsic value, an insight that was instrumental in alleviating her anxiety.\n\nAs the sessions progressed, Xiaoxi's demeanor transformed. The initial sessions, characterized by a cautious and subdued presence, gave way to a more confident and optimistic outlook. By the conclusion of the counseling, Xiaoxi's disposition was noticeably brighter; she was smiling more, exhibiting a newfound self-assurance that was evident to both herself and those around her. This transformation was not just superficial but indicative of deeper psychological shifts.\n\nFollow-up visits confirmed the sustained impact of the counseling. Xiaoxi's sleep patterns had normalized, a tangible indicator of reduced anxiety. Her perception of the upcoming graduate exams shifted from one of dread to a manageable challenge. This shift was accompanied by a broader re-evaluation of her self and her capabilities, allowing her to approach her goals with renewed vigor.\n\nFurthermore, Xiaoxi's improved mental state was corroborated by feedback from her teachers and classmates, who observed her increased engagement and positivity. This external validation reinforced the internal changes Xiaoxi was experiencing, creating a positive feedback loop that bolstered her confidence.\n\nReflecting on Xiaoxi's journey, it is clear that her case underscores the complex interplay between cognitive, emotional, and behavioral factors in the manifestation of anxiety. Her story illustrates the profound impact of cognitive restructuring and behavioral interventions in alleviating psychological distress. It also highlights the importance of self-awareness and self-acceptance in fostering resilience against future challenges.\n\nXiaoxi's case reaffirms the therapeutic value of creating a safe and supportive environment where clients can explore and redefine their narratives. It reminds us of the power of empathy and patience in facilitating meaningful change. As a clinician, witnessing Xiaoxi's transformation was a testament to the effectiveness of a tailored therapeutic approach that respects the individuality of each client's journey.\n\nIn conclusion, Xiaoxi's counseling experience not only addressed her immediate exam anxiety but also equipped her with the tools and insights necessary for long-term psychological well-being. Her journey from anxiety to self-assuredness exemplifies the potential for growth inherent in the therapeutic process, offering hope and inspiration for both clients and clinicians alike.", "causes": "Major life events (failure in the college entrance\nexamination) and social factors (stress in the graduate school entrance examination)", "symptoms": "Exam anxiety", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection;\nHumanistic therapy: listening, empathy, etc.;\nCognitive-behavioral therapy: reconstructing academically- based self-perception;\nSystematic desensitization therapy: Relaxation from low to high sensitivity environments.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Universal", "treatment_effect": "I have established a good counseling relationship, become more confident and optimistic, improve self-awareness, improve sleep\nquality, and master relaxation skills."}

More information is revealed through children's candid expressions, emotions, and behavioral changes; unfortunately, parents often overlook these cues. Below, we provide two common examples of family dialogue scenarios."], "consultation_process": ["[Scene One]", "The child came home, and the mother asked, \"How was your day?\"", "The child hesitated and replied, \"It's okay.\"", "Father immediately interjected, \"What do you mean by 'not bad'?\"", "The child squeezed out a little smile and said, \"I wasn't criticized by the teacher.\"", "The mother pressed, \"Is it okay as long as you haven't been criticized?\" The child was speechless.", "Mother said again, \"When will you get a compliment so we can be happy?\"", "The child murmured, \"Okay.\"", "The father continued, \"Don't brush off your mother; she has worried enough about you.\" The child's face was expressionless.", "Father intensified his tone: \"Do you know what you need to do to earn praise?\"", "The child replied anxiously, \"I don't know.\"", "The father said seriously, \"First, study well, work hard and make progress, and listen to your teachers...\" The child remained stuck in a state of distress, waiting for the conversation to end.", "Finally, Mother said, \"Wash your hands and come eat!\"", "The child's face immediately relaxed, and he said loudly, \"Okay.\" Then he hurriedly fled.", "In such communication, the content, intention, and direction of the interaction are determined by the parents, while the child passively responds.

You are really too lazy!\"", "The daughter said to her mother, \"Okay, I'll go mop the floor.\" This expresses a sense of obedience, even a deliberate attempt to please, but it hides a defense mechanism inside, fearing further communication with her mother.", "When the daughter was mopping the floor, the mother shouted loudly, \"Look at the floor you mopped! It’s worse than not mopping at all. After raising you for so long, you can't even mop the floor!\"", "The father saw his wife scolding their daughter as he entered the door, saying to her, \"You are really too lazy.

When I was your age, I was already independent.\"", "The father turned to his wife again and said, \"It's all your fault for spoiling our daughter, and you don't care how tired I am... You stay at home every day, and I expect you to take good care of the child, but look at what has happened...\"", "Mother said angrily, \"You only know how to criticize me. What about you? I can't see you for days on end, and you don't care about anything at home.\"", "The father was also angry and said to his daughter, \"We work hard every day to earn money for you, can't you help your parents ease their worries and focus on studying? Just look at your grades, who do they reflect well on?\"", "Mother said beside, \"We ask you to do some work for the sake of loving and raising you, and you still feel wronged.\"", "The daughter is forced to be in a position where she feels helpless and caught in a dilemma, as either choice leads to a loss; whether she changes or not, there is no way out. If she doesn’t mop the floor, she has to continue enduring her mother’s accusations and complaints; if she does mop the floor, she still has to bear new accusations and complaints from her mother, and either way, she is unhappy. The contradictory messages from her mother actually weaken the motivation for the children to grow. The feeling in the child’s heart is: \"No matter what, I can't escape my mother's dissatisfaction with me.\""], "experience_and_reflection": "Through the examination of the two segments of family communication detailed in this case, we can deepen our understanding of the complex interplay of family dynamics and its impact on adolescent psychological growth. This expanded reflection aims to further explore and articulate the nuanced psychological processes at play, providing a richer clinical analysis that incorporates both the original insights and additional considerations from a seasoned clinician's perspective.\n\nFirstly, it's crucial to delve deeper into the concept of hostile relationships within the family unit. In the examples provided, the mother's dual role as both initiator and resolver of family tensions highlights a common dynamic where one parent, often the mother, becomes the emotional epicenter. This pattern can lead to a triangulation effect, where the child becomes a conduit for unresolved parental tensions. Such dynamics can foster an environment of pseudo-unity between parents when confronting the child, creating a facade of cohesion that is ultimately detrimental. The child, in this scenario, may internalize a sense of being an object of control rather than a valued member of the family. This objectification can erode trust and contribute to a profound sense of insecurity, as children learn to anticipate criticism rather than support from their family members. Over time, this insecurity can manifest in difficulties in forming trusting relationships outside the family, as the child may subconsciously expect similar patterns of control and judgment in broader social interactions.\n\nSecondly, the issue of lack of intimacy in parent-child communication warrants further exploration. The original reflection noted the emotionally distant nature of such interactions, but it's important to recognize how this distance is often compounded by cultural narratives and societal expectations. In many cultures, including those heavily influenced by Confucian values like the one described, there is an implicit expectation that children should respect and obey their elders without question. This cultural backdrop can inadvertently stifle open communication, as children learn that expressing dissent or emotion might be interpreted as disrespectful. Consequently, parents may believe they are fulfilling their roles by imparting wisdom or guidance, yet fail to engage with their children on a meaningful emotional level. This disconnect can prevent children from developing a secure sense of self, as they are not afforded the space to explore their emotions and thoughts freely within the family context. Additionally, this lack of emotional engagement can deprive children of the opportunity to build resilience, as they may struggle to identify and articulate their own needs and feelings when faced with challenges.\n\nThirdly, we must consider the formation of psychological symptoms in the context of these family interactions. The emphasis on academic performance as a primary measure of a child's worth can be particularly damaging, leading to a narrow definition of success that overlooks the importance of emotional and psychological well-being. In families where academic achievement is prioritized above all else, children may develop a fragile sense of self-esteem that is contingent on external validation. This can create a precarious foundation for self-worth, as children may come to view love and acceptance as conditional upon their performance. The pressure to meet these expectations can lead to heightened anxiety, perfectionism, and a fear of failure, which may manifest as avoidance behaviors or even burnout. Furthermore, when academic performance falters, children may experience a profound sense of failure, exacerbating feelings of inadequacy and potentially leading to depressive symptoms. It is essential for parents to recognize the multifaceted nature of success and to support their children in developing a balanced sense of self-worth that encompasses both achievements and personal growth.\n\nMoreover, the concept of dissatisfaction with children being vented through \"education\" deserves further elaboration. In many cases, what is presented as guidance or concern is, in reality, a projection of parental dissatisfaction or unmet needs. Parents may mask their frustrations with their own lives under the guise of educational efforts, inadvertently placing undue pressure on their children to fulfill roles or achieve goals that the parents themselves did not. This dynamic can create a paradoxical situation for children, where they receive conflicting messages of care and criticism, leading to confusion and frustration. Over time, children may develop maladaptive coping mechanisms to navigate these contradictory demands, such as people-pleasing behaviors or emotional withdrawal. These coping strategies, while serving an immediate protective function, can hinder the child's ability to develop a healthy sense of identity and self-efficacy. It is vital for parents to engage in self-reflection and consider how their own experiences and expectations may influence their interactions with their children, fostering an environment that prioritizes open dialogue and mutual understanding.\n\nFifth, the formation of family cyclical conflicts can be better understood by examining the systemic nature of these interactions. Each family member's behavior is both a response to and a catalyst for the actions of others, creating a feedback loop that can perpetuate negative patterns. For instance, the father's criticism of the mother can exacerbate her stress and frustration, leading her to be more critical of the child, which in turn reinforces the father's belief that the mother is not handling the situation effectively. This cycle can become entrenched, as each family member assumes a fixed role within the dynamic, making it difficult to break free from the established pattern. Addressing these cyclical conflicts requires a systemic approach that acknowledges the interdependence of family members and encourages collaborative problem-solving. By shifting the focus from individual blame to collective responsibility, families can begin to identify and address the underlying issues that contribute to these patterns, fostering a more harmonious and supportive environment.\n\nFinally, the sculpting effect of language is a powerful concept that highlights the profound impact of parental communication on a child's self-perception. Language is not merely a tool for conveying information; it is a medium through which children construct their understanding of themselves and the world around them. When parents consistently use negative language to evaluate their children, they risk instilling a self-defeating narrative that can shape the child's identity and behavior. Conversely, positive and affirming language can nurture a child's confidence and resilience, encouraging them to embrace challenges and view setbacks as opportunities for growth. It is crucial for parents to be mindful of the language they use and to strive for a balanced approach that acknowledges both the child's strengths and areas for improvement. By fostering a supportive and affirming communication style, parents can help their children develop a healthy sense of self that is characterized by self-compassion, adaptability, and a willingness to learn from experience.\n\nIn conclusion, the expanded reflection on this case underscores the importance of fostering healthy family dynamics and communication patterns to support the psychological growth of adolescents. By addressing the systemic and cultural factors that influence family interactions, parents can create an environment that nurtures their children's emotional and psychological well-being.

Sometimes they have disagreements, but when the girl’s sister is around, they can get along harmoniously. At times, the visitor can guess the items in the room based on its arrangement, and she was even able to guess a classmate's mother’s license plate number, which was confirmed to be correct. The visitor believes that the girl inside her has granted her a special ability to see things that others cannot. In the past six months, these two girls have left her body, and a man has appeared who frequently commands her to do bad things and cause destruction. He often thinks about destroying the Earth and creating a new one. Once, while the visitor was showering, the man inside her ordered her to take out her heart. She felt fear and only purchased a knife online, which is now kept at home, and this has been verified. Another time, the visitor intentionally broke a glass cup and showed the shards to a girl sitting next to her, fully aware that she would harm herself by cutting her wrist. The visitor believes she is good at pretending and feels happy inside when she sees others get hurt. During times of emotional instability, she has also cut her wrist with a blade multiple times, feeling a sense of comfort and pressure release when she sees the blood flow.

She said that the doctors there did not listen to her express her inner pain in detail. Although she received the medication and could take it at home, this child felt that coming to the hospital was not easy, as her mother worked away from home for a long time, and she usually lived with her grandmother. Therefore, the child wanted to find a psychologist for counseling to share her suppressed distress. In this situation, the child came to my office, and we began the counseling process. Through our first communication, I learned that the child grew up in a family lacking parental love, where her parents had emotional conflicts and often quarreled. Her mother has a quick temper and underlying anxiety, indicative of a basal ganglia neurodevelopmental issue. Conflicts also arise between the mother and the child during their interactions. Growing up in such a family environment has left the child with internal conflicts and unstable emotions; she sometimes exhibits impulsive behaviors, leading to self-harm, which are factors contributing to the formation of borderline personality traits. Due to her parents working away, the child lives with her grandmother. She has high academic expectations for herself, experiences significant pressure from her studies, and struggles with interpersonal relationships. This accumulated pressure over time has not been effectively released, resulting in hallucinations and delusions, where she feels as if someone is talking to her or harming her, leading to anxiety and fear. Ultimately, she mustered the courage to seek help. The issues faced by this child reflect the importance of parental love, the family environment, the interaction patterns between parents, and genetic factors as the main causes of her problems. For the child to grow up healthy both physically and mentally, parents need to engage with her correctly."], "experience_and_reflection": "Through the consultation of this case, I have gained profound insights into the intricate interplay between familial dynamics, psychological development, and individual pathology. This particular case has underscored the critical role parents play in shaping the mental and emotional well-being of their children. It has illuminated the complex ways in which a child's issues often mirror the unresolved conflicts and behavioral patterns of their parents.\n\nIn reflecting on the young visitor's journey, I am reminded of the profound influence of parental engagement and modeling on adolescent development. The family environment acts as a crucible where the child's identity and self-concept are forged. In this case, the persistent discord between the parents, characterized by frequent arguments and a lack of emotional intimacy, has undeniably shaped the child's perception of relationships and self-worth. This discord has not only led to a fraught parent-child relationship but has also contributed to the formation of borderline personality traits and the manifestation of schizophrenic symptoms.\n\nThe mother’s quick temper and underlying anxiety, potentially indicative of basal ganglia neurodevelopmental issues, have created a volatile home environment. The visitor's defensive reactions during maternal interactions highlight the deep-seated emotional wounds inflicted by such an environment. The child’s impulsive behaviors, including self-harm, appear to be attempts to exert control over an uncontrollable emotional landscape. These behaviors are symptomatic of a broader struggle with identity and belonging, exacerbated by the lack of secure parental attachment and the emotional burden of the parents’ marital discord.\n\nThe child's hallucinations and delusions can be seen as manifestations of an internalized chaos, reflecting her subconscious attempts to navigate the fragmented familial reality. Her belief in possessing special abilities and the emergence of commanding figures in her psyche are indicative of her search for agency and significance in a world where she feels unseen and unheard. The symbolic narrative of destruction and self-harm underscores her internal conflict and the desperate need for emotional release.\n\nAs the clinician involved in this case, I must acknowledge the importance of a holistic therapeutic approach that addresses both the individual's psychological needs and the broader familial context. The intervention plan, which combines biological, psychological, and social strategies, aims to foster a comprehensive healing process. Exercise and medication offer physiological support, mitigating anxiety and stabilizing mood fluctuations. Cognitive therapy and mindfulness-based stress reduction empower the child to reinterpret her experiences and develop healthier coping mechanisms. Integrating psychoanalysis and family therapy seeks to mend the fractured familial bonds and establish a nurturing environment conducive to the child’s growth.\n\nIn facilitating this process, the cooperation of the parents is paramount. Their willingness to engage in therapeutic interventions and adapt their interaction patterns has been instrumental in the child's recovery. The improvements in the familial atmosphere and the restoration of the parent-child relationship are testaments to the transformative power of targeted interventions. The child's return to school and her improved social interactions signify a positive trajectory in her psychological development.\n\nReflecting further, this case serves as a poignant reminder of the systemic nature of psychological disorders. It emphasizes the necessity for clinicians to consider the broader socio-cultural and familial influences that shape individual pathology. The child’s experience is not an isolated phenomenon but a reflection of the cumulative effects of her environment. This perspective necessitates a shift in therapeutic focus from solely treating symptoms to addressing underlying relational dynamics and societal pressures.\n\nMoreover, this case highlights the importance of early intervention and preventive measures. Identifying at-risk individuals and providing timely support can mitigate the progression of mental health issues. Schools, healthcare providers, and communities must collaborate to create supportive networks that foster resilience and well-being among adolescents. Educating parents about the impact of their behaviors and emotional states on their children is crucial in cultivating nurturing environments.\n\nThe role of genetics in mental health cannot be overlooked, although this case presents no direct familial history of schizophrenia. Genetic predispositions interact with environmental factors, shaping individual vulnerability to psychological disorders. Understanding these interactions can inform personalized treatment plans and enhance the efficacy of interventions.\n\nIn conclusion, this case has enriched my understanding of the multifaceted nature of psychological disorders and the indispensable role of family dynamics in shaping mental health outcomes. It has reinforced the importance of a comprehensive, integrative approach to treatment, one that addresses both individual symptoms and familial interactions. The journey of this young visitor underscores the resilience of the human spirit and the capacity for transformation through empathy, understanding, and collaborative healing efforts.

They first introduced him to a girl from their hometown, who had come to Beijing with her parents who collected waste. Although she had not attended school for long, she had not experienced much hardship either; she was quiet, gentle, and very much appreciated by his mother. The younger brother's initial obedience was finally provoked, and a few days before the wedding, he ran to his girlfriend's hometown, wanting to elope with the heartbroken girl. The girl, whose heart was already broken, knew of his arrival but called out a tall, handsome boy from the house, saying that he was her new boyfriend whom she had just met, and they were already planning to get married.

My sister quietly shed tears beside them. This family turned out to be a one-man show performed by Mom."], "experience_and_reflection": "The case of the younger brother presents a compelling narrative of how family dynamics can profoundly affect an individual's mental health and self-perception. This young man, polite and delicate, yet emotionally constrained, is the embodiment of a complex web of familial expectations, disappointments, and unresolved emotional conflicts. As I reflect on this case, it becomes increasingly apparent that the role he plays in his family is not merely that of a \"patient\" but of a scapegoat, burdened by the unresolved aspirations and failures of his family members.\n\nFrom the outset, the family dynamics were characterized by an overbearing maternal influence, a passive paternal presence, and a sister caught in the crossfire of loyalty and her own aspirations. The parents, particularly the mother, appear to project their unfulfilled desires onto their son, seeing him as a vessel through which their dreams could be realized. Their insistence on controlling his life choices, from his romantic relationships to his career path, reflects a deep-seated need to retain control and fulfill their own narrative of success and family honor. This control, however, comes at the expense of the younger brother's autonomy and mental well-being.\n\nThe younger brother's initial compliance with his parents' wishes can be seen as a manifestation of deep-rooted filial piety, a cultural value that emphasizes respect and obedience to one's parents. However, this compliance gradually eroded his sense of self, leading to a profound internal conflict. His abrupt move to Beijing, leaving behind a promising career and a loving relationship, marked the beginning of his emotional decline. The forced marriage, arranged by his mother, further compounded his feelings of entrapment and helplessness. His attempted elopement with his former girlfriend was not just an act of defiance but a desperate bid for personal freedom and happiness.\n\nIn psychoanalytic terms, the younger brother's behavior can be understood through the lens of the Oedipal complex, where the unresolved parental control and emotional enmeshment stifle his individuation process. His retreat into silence and disengagement from life is a defense mechanism, a way to cope with the overwhelming expectations and disappointments he faces. His lack of enthusiasm for work and family life is not a sign of laziness or irresponsibility but a symptom of a deeper psychological malaise, a form of learned helplessness where he feels powerless to change his circumstances.\n\nThe role of the sister in this family dynamic is equally significant. She is torn between her allegiance to her parental family and her responsibilities towards her own family. Her financial support for her brother's failed business venture is indicative of her internalized guilt and responsibility for his well-being. Yet, her tears during our session suggest a burgeoning awareness of the need to redefine her role within the family. Encouraging her to see her brother as an adult, capable of making his own choices, is a crucial step towards breaking the cycle of dependency and enabling her brother to reclaim his autonomy.\n\nThe mother's role as the central figure in this family drama cannot be overstated. Her inability to recognize her son's individuality and her propensity to blame him for the family's misfortunes reflect her own unresolved psychological issues. Her emotional volatility, alternating between anger and despair, underscores her difficulty in accepting responsibility for her actions and their impact on her children. The younger brother, cast as the \"designated patient,\" bears the brunt of her emotional burden, becoming the scapegoat for the family's failures and an outlet for her frustrations.\n\nIn our sessions, I aimed to create a space where the younger brother could express his emotions without fear of judgment or reprisal. Acknowledging his efforts and struggles within the family was an essential step in validating his experiences and affirming his sense of self. The tears he shed during our conversation were not merely an expression of sadness but a cathartic release of years of repressed emotions. They marked the beginning of a journey towards healing and self-discovery, a tentative step towards reclaiming his narrative.\n\nAddressing the mother's behavior was equally crucial. By confronting her with the reality of her actions and their consequences, I sought to shift her perspective and encourage her to take responsibility for her role in her son's plight. This confrontation was not intended to blame but to facilitate a deeper understanding of her motivations and the need for change. It is only through this process of introspection and acceptance that she can begin to support her son in a more constructive and nurturing manner.\n\nThe father's role, though seemingly minor, is also worth exploring. His passive demeanor and occasional outbursts in dialect suggest a resignation to the family dynamics, perhaps rooted in cultural and generational norms. Encouraging him to engage more actively in family discussions and decisions could help balance the familial power dynamics and provide his son with a more supportive paternal presence.\n\nAs I reflect on this case, the notion of \"home\" emerges as a central theme. For the sister, redefining \"home\" as a place of personal growth and autonomy is pivotal in her journey towards independence. For the younger brother, home is both a physical space and an emotional state, a place where he can find acceptance and support for his true self. Helping him to establish boundaries and assert his needs within the family is essential for his emotional well-being and recovery.\n\nThis case highlights the intricate interplay of familial roles and expectations, cultural values, and individual aspirations. It underscores the importance of addressing these dynamics in psychotherapy to foster healing and personal growth. The journey for this family is far from over, but with continued support and introspection, there is hope for transformation and reconciliation. For the younger brother, the path to reclaiming his identity and agency is challenging but attainable. It requires courage, self-awareness, and a willingness to confront painful truths, both for himself and his family.\n\nIn conclusion, this case serves as a poignant reminder of the profound impact of family dynamics on mental health and the therapeutic potential of psychoanalysis in unraveling these complex relationships. As clinicians, our role is to facilitate this process of exploration and healing, empowering individuals to forge new paths and redefine their narratives in pursuit of a more fulfilling and authentic life.", "causes": "Parenting environment (strong mother, absent father), life events (breakup), and social factors (entrepreneurial failure)", "symptoms": "Depression, self-isolation", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection;\npsychoanalysis", "characteristics_of_illness": "Families come before the person concerned for help and guidance", "treatment_effect": "A good relationship was established, the impact of the family\nenvironment on the client was explored and perceived, and the change was paved for change, and the negative emotions that the client had     suppressed for many years were relieved, and his inner thoughts were  expressed."}

However, after a while, I started to miss home, and I wanted to go back home, and when I got back home, I didn't want to go to school anymore.\"", "I asked Xiaojing, \"What does it feel like to miss home?\"", "Xiaojing said, \"I feel very empty and insecure, and then I start having trouble sleeping at night. But once I get home, I feel secure and very tired; I sleep very soundly at home.\"", "When the conversation reached this point, I understood the reason why Xiaojing didn't leave home.", "I pointed to the consultation system on the wall and said to Xiao Jing, \"Xiao Jing, I will keep everything you say here confidential, including from your parents.\" Xiao Jing nodded seriously. I then said, \"Xiao Jing, please ask your parents to come over so we can sit down and talk.\" Xiao Jing lowered her head and said softly, \"I don't want to talk to them.\" Since that's the case, I asked Xiao Jing to take her brother to wait in the next room while I invited her parents into the consultation room.", "I asked Xiaojing's parents, \"What do you think is the reason Xiaojing is unwilling to go to school?\"", "Dad said, \"It's all spoiled by her. When he was in elementary school, the school was so close to home, and we even brought him food. Now that he's so big, he still needs to be picked up and dropped off for school. This child just lacks independence.\" Mom didn't say anything.", "I asked again, \"How did you handle the fact that the child changed schools several times?\"", "The two people suddenly fell silent, and after a long wait, the mother finally said, \"I know that both of us have the wrong attitude towards the child. We often scold her and sometimes even hit her.\"", "\"Then how would you curse her?\"", "\"I've said that it's embarrassing to stay at home all day; I'm too ashamed to go out. Everyone else is doing well in school, but look at you! Sometimes I even say it would be better if you just died! That being said, other people's children go to school smoothly and don't spend a penny extra. We've already spent over ten thousand just to transfer our child to another school. Farming in the countryside isn't easy, and this child is so unmotivated and frustrating. We don't mind spending money; we just want you to do well in school! You're so young, and we can't even trust you to go out and work. This child is truly worrisome; there's no one in the village like her.\" Clearly, Xiaojing's parents are filled with grievances and anger. All I did was listen to their complaints. I affirmed Xiaojing's parents for their persistence and love as parents. As rural parents with limited income and knowledge, they still came to the counseling room. Regardless of their attitudes or actions, their initial intention must have been out of love for their child. But what message are they conveying to the child through their actions?", "I used a role-reversal technique to make Xiaojing's parents close their eyes, guiding them to experience what it feels like to be Xiaojing, who frequently transfers schools but cannot leave home. Then I took on the role of the domineering mother: I suddenly raised my voice by 18 degrees and said sternly, \"Xiaojing, I really don't want to see you. Other kids are doing well in school, but you’re making a fool of yourself at home. I’m even embarrassed to go out now; just looking at you annoys me...\" At this moment, tears began to flow from the mother’s eyes, and I knew she had entered her role. I then added fuel to the fire: \"Why are you still not dead?\" The mother’s tears flowed like a burst dam, and the father suddenly panicked: \"Well, actually...\" I quickly used my eyes to stop him from speaking.", "I asked my mom, \"What are your feelings?\"", "\"I feel particularly wronged, particularly angry, and particularly resentful.\" The fact that Mom used the word \"particularly\" three times shows how deeply she feels.", "When mom calms down, I said to Xiao Jing's parents, \"You must love your child, even more than other parents do.\" They nodded repeatedly, but when you treat your child like that, what does the child receive? Mom said, \"I think it's resentment! And disdain!\"", "During the second consultation, Xiaojing came with her parents, while her younger brother stayed at home. I used Satir's techniques to sculpt their family triangle, allowing each of them to express their love and appreciation for one another. Watching the three of them happily holding hands together, I felt an overwhelming sense of emotion: when parents understand their children, and children empathize with their parents, love will flow in this home again.", "I hope that after Xiao Jing receives more love from her parents, the child who is reluctant to leave home will be able to confidently step out the door and earnestly engage in the exciting and joyful learning life at school."], "experience_and_reflection": "As I reflect upon Xiaojing's case, I am drawn to the profound complexity inherent in the relationship between a child and their parents. The image of a mother striking her child on the street, with the child clinging to her leg despite the abuse, vividly encapsulates the duality of human attachment and the emotional turmoil experienced by Xiaojing. This poignant scene serves as a metaphor for the pervasive desire for acceptance and love, even when faced with rejection and harshness. It highlights the paradox of attachment, where the child, despite suffering, seeks solace in the very source of their distress. Xiaojing's experience is emblematic of the intricate dance between dependency and autonomy, a dynamic that plays out in countless families struggling with similar issues.\n\nChildren like Xiaojing may exhibit an outward reluctance to attend school, but this behavior is often symptomatic of deeper underlying issues. In Xiaojing's case, her fear of school is intricately intertwined with feelings of loneliness and insecurity. Her longing for home is not merely a geographical preference but rather a quest for emotional sanctuary. This yearning is exacerbated by the perceived favoritism shown towards her younger brother, which deepens her feelings of isolation and inadequacy. Xiaojing's situation underscores the importance of understanding the emotional landscape of a child who appears reluctant to engage in the world outside their home. It is a landscape often marked by fear, insecurity, and a desire for validation that goes unmet.\n\nIn exploring Xiaojing's case, I am reminded of the critical role that parents play in shaping their child's self-perception and emotional health. The harsh words and actions of Xiaojing's parents, though perhaps rooted in frustration and a desire for her success, convey a message of rejection and disdain rather than support and encouragement. This unintended communication can significantly impact a child's ability to thrive academically and socially. The irony lies in the parents' intentions; despite their expressions of love and concern, their actions inadvertently foster the very environment of anxiety and retreat they wish to eradicate.\n\nThe therapeutic journey with Xiaojing and her family revealed the power of empathy and understanding in transforming relationships. The role-reversal technique used with her parents was a pivotal moment in the therapeutic process, allowing them to viscerally experience the emotional impact of their words and actions. This exercise highlighted the importance of emotional intelligence and empathy in parenting. By stepping into Xiaojing's shoes, her parents could begin to comprehend the depth of her emotional pain and the longing for acceptance and love.\n\nThe subsequent sessions, utilizing Satir's techniques, focused on rebuilding familial connections through expressions of appreciation and love. This process of sculpting the family dynamics was transformative, enabling each member to recognize the shared love that existed beneath layers of misunderstanding and resentment. Watching the family hold hands, visibly moved by the newfound understanding, was a testament to the healing power of empathy and communication. It reinforced the idea that when parents truly understand their children, and children empathize with their parents, the home becomes a place where love flows freely and problems diminish.\n\nReflecting on Xiaojing's case has deepened my understanding of the intricate web of familial relationships and the significant impact these relationships have on a child's development. It has reinforced the necessity of creating an environment where emotional safety is prioritized, where children feel secure in expressing their fears and aspirations without judgment or reproach. The case underscores the importance of addressing not just the symptoms of reluctance, such as school avoidance, but the root causes of emotional distress that drive these behaviors.\n\nMoreover, this reflection prompts me to consider the broader societal implications of Xiaojing's experience. In many ways, her reluctance to attend school is indicative of a larger issue within our educational and familial systems. It raises questions about how schools and families can better support children who struggle with emotional and social challenges. It suggests a need for increased awareness and training for parents and educators alike, focusing on fostering environments that prioritize emotional well-being alongside academic achievement.\n\nAs a clinician, this case has been a reminder of the transformative potential of therapy, not only in resolving specific behavioral issues but in fostering holistic growth and understanding within families. It has emphasized the importance of patience, empathy, and active listening in the therapeutic process. By providing a safe space for Xiaojing to express her fears and desires, and facilitating her parents' journey toward greater empathy, we were able to create a path toward healing and growth.\n\nIn closing, Xiaojing's case serves as a poignant reminder of the complexities inherent in parent-child relationships. It highlights the necessity for clinicians to delve deeply into the emotional narratives that shape a child's experience, recognizing the profound impact of familial interactions on their development. Through empathy, understanding, and communication, we can help families navigate these complexities, fostering environments where children like Xiaojing can confidently step out into the world, secure in the knowledge that they are loved and supported.", "causes": "Parenting environment and social factors (interpersonal adjustment difficulties)", "symptoms": "weariness", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection;\nFamily Therapy and Role Reversal Techniques: Asking family members what they think and feel, and inviting the  mother to experience the daughter role;\nSATIR Technique: Rebuild family bonds by expressing appreciation and love.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Although they have been treated badly by their parents,\nthey still use their home as an emotional refuge", "treatment_effect": "A good counseling relationship was established, and parents were guided to discover the impact of their bad behavior on their daughters and make timely adjustments, positive emotions such as love and\nappreciation were re-established among family members."}

As a result, the child ran away from school and called me saying he didn't want to go to school anymore; he wants to go out to work. I don't know how to communicate with him. Part of me thinks maybe he should go work and experience some hardships to realize the importance of studying. However, I'm also afraid that if he goes out to work and mixes with the wrong crowd, he might get influenced negatively and want to avoid studying even more. If he doesn't study, he won't have any skills. What will he do in the future?", "Counselor: I sense that you are very anxious right now. What impact has this situation had on you?", "Visitor: I can't sleep at night now, just thinking about what to do and how to talk to my child. I'm particularly anxious that if the child doesn't change, they won't be able to continue attending school.", "Counselor: I would like to know how your relationship with the child is.", "Visitor: The child has a more outgoing personality and tells me everything. Our relationship is very good. His relationship with his dad is also okay, but he is a bit afraid of being criticized by his dad.", "Counselor: This is the third time the child has been caught playing on the phone by the teacher. How did you handle the issue of phone usage before this?", "Visitor: We have talked to our child well, hoping he can avoid using his phone at school and play a bit by himself at home. We don't want to pressure him too much. He hopes to pursue a career in the arts or sports, and we are actively helping him find teachers in those fields to assess whether he is suitable. Last time, we even agreed that after returning to school, he would call us every night, and as long as he called, we would trust that he wasn't using his phone. However, he only managed to stick to it for a week before the teacher discovered it again.", "Counselor: It's clear that you love your child very much, and you are trying to help him in your own way. I can understand how worried you are as a mother and how much you hope for his well-being.", "Visitor: Now I am confused and wonder if too much indulgence from a loving mother can spoil the child. We have spent too little time with our children, which is why they are like this now. In the past, I often acted without principles and didn't require my child to hold themselves to strict standards. Now, it is very difficult to correct this.", "Counselor: What do you mean specifically? Can you give an example?", "Visitor: For example, we agreed to play mobile games for a few minutes, but when the time is up, he doesn't stick to it and asks to extend the time instead. We can't do anything about it. Moreover, after being criticized by the teacher for playing on his phone, he even wrote a letter of commitment to change, but in the end, he still couldn't do it.", "Counselor: It sounds like the child subjectively wants to overcome this issue, but due to a lack of self-control, they have been unable to persist.", "Visitor: Yes, the child is about to return from a friend's house, and I don't know how to communicate with him next.

We need to understand what difficulties the child is currently facing.", "Visitor: The child performed well in the first year of high school and was making progress at that time. However, after the winter vacation, the grades started to decline in the second year, and there were problems with studying. Then the issue of playing on the phone arose.", "Counselor: Yes, we can explore these aspects to better understand the child, whether the decline in their academic performance is due to playing on the phone, or if they are using the phone to cope with difficulties in their studies and the pressure they are facing.", "Visitor: After this incident, he called me that day and said, \"I need to go out and work; I have to walk my own path. I feel sorry for you.\" Hearing this made me very upset, but I tried my best to comfort him on the phone and didn't criticize him.", "Counselor: Being able to say these words shows that your child still has a sense of responsibility. After encountering difficulties, he feels guilty, which is not the attitude of someone who is indifferent after discovering a problem. Seeing this, how do you think you can support your child in facing the current challenges?", "Visitor: I think I should talk to him first to understand his true thoughts, what his purpose of working is, and what his long-term plans are.", "Counselor: Well, very good. You see, when he says he has to walk his own path, we know that the child is actually a relatively mature adult with independent thoughts. If we can view the child as an equal and talk to him about the future, for example, whether he can handle the situations he may face when he goes out to work, and whether his future life might suffer due to not learning more knowledge, these are all topics we can explore.", "Visitor: What should I do if he insists on going out to work? I'm very worried that he will get influenced by bad company. Especially with smoking, he can't quit now, and if he goes out, he might smoke even more.", "Counselor: What are you most worried about regarding this issue?", "Visitor: I'm especially anxious about his health being affected.", "Counselor: How does the child view the issue of smoking?", "Visitor: He started off thinking he was very cool, and later when I asked him to quit, he said he knew it was bad for his health, but he needed to quit gradually. I know he can never control himself to quit.", "Counselor: Whether it's playing on the phone or smoking, I can sense that the child actually understands the situation. It's just that they may lack self-control, which is understandable because these addictive things can be hard for adults to manage, let alone adolescents. I would like to know how you plan to face these issues if they cannot be resolved immediately.", "Visitor: I guess I can only accept it. I have no other choice.", "Counselor: Perhaps we can try to help the child face his difficulties, for example, by discussing a way to supervise him, only asking for a little progress each time. Even a small improvement can be encouraged to affirm his efforts. If the child is willing to continue school, we can find a way to communicate with the teacher, not to impose such high demands all at once, but to help the child overcome challenges little by little. If the child really wants to work, we can discuss some basic principles that need attention and anticipate the difficulties he may face.", "Visitor: Well, I will have a good talk with him. Thank you, I feel like I now have better methods and skills for communicating with my child.", "Counselor: I sense that you are able to accept your child more. What new impact could this bring to you?", "Visitor: I'm not as anxious anymore; I'm not as nervous as I was at the beginning."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on this case, I've come to appreciate the nuanced dynamics at play in the parent-child relationship and how the application of narrative therapy techniques can foster meaningful change. The mother's journey from feeling anxious and overwhelmed to finding a sense of empowerment and clarity is a testament to the potential of therapeutic intervention when tailored to the unique needs of the client.\n\nInitially, the mother's anxiety was palpable. Her fear stemmed from a perceived loss of control over her child's future, compounded by guilt over past parenting decisions. This situation is not uncommon; many parents feel a sense of panic when they perceive their child veering off a traditional academic path, particularly when societal pressures and expectations weigh heavily. The mother's sleepless nights and constant worry were clear indicators of how deeply this issue affected her emotional well-being.\n\nThe technique of externalization in narrative therapy proved invaluable in this context. By helping the mother separate her child's academic problems from the child's identity, we could explore the issues without assigning blame or fostering a sense of failure. This separation allowed the mother to focus on the underlying factors contributing to her child's behavior rather than viewing it as a reflection of her parenting. It's important to recognize how externalization can diffuse tension and open up a space for constructive dialogue and problem-solving.\n\nThroughout the sessions, a critical element was recognizing and affirming the mother's core strengths. By witnessing and validating her dedication and love for her child, she began to see herself not as a failure but as a parent capable of supporting her child through challenges. This shift in perspective is crucial in empowering clients to take proactive steps rather than being mired in self-doubt.\n\nThe consultation process highlighted the importance of understanding both social and psychological factors influencing the situation. The pressure from the school environment was significant, and the mother's attribution of her child's issues to her parenting style needed gentle reframing. By examining her cognitive perspective on her child's growth and future, we worked towards a more balanced view that acknowledged external stressors while empowering her to influence change.\n\nA particularly powerful moment in our sessions was when we explored the child's aspirations and strengths. The mother had been so focused on the immediate academic issues that she hadn't fully appreciated her child's interests in arts and sports. By shifting the narrative to include these positive aspects, the mother could see her child as a whole person with potential and dreams, rather than just a student struggling with academic performance.\n\nThis case also underscored the importance of communication strategies. The mother realized that her attempts to control or change her child's behavior through strict rules were counterproductive. Instead, by approaching her child as an equal and engaging in open conversations about his hopes and fears, she found a new way to connect with him. This approach respects the child's growing autonomy and encourages mutual understanding and collaboration in problem-solving.\n\nAnother critical insight was the child's sense of responsibility and guilt, which emerged during our discussions. This acknowledgment of his feelings provided a foundation for the mother to build on, reinforcing her support rather than resorting to punitive measures. Understanding that her child was not indifferent but struggling with self-control issues helped the mother adopt a more compassionate stance.\n\nThe mother's concern about her child's smoking and phone use highlighted a common challenge in parenting adolescents: managing behaviors that have become coping mechanisms for underlying stress. In our discussions, we emphasized small, achievable goals, encouraging the child to take incremental steps towards improvement. This approach not only alleviated the pressure on the child but also helped the mother see progress, however small, as a sign of growth and development.\n\nAs the counseling sessions progressed, the mother began to accept her child's current state while remaining hopeful for the future. This acceptance did not imply resignation but rather an acknowledgment of the present realities and a commitment to support her child unconditionally. This mindset is crucial in narrative therapy, where the focus is on empowering clients to rewrite their stories in a way that embraces both strengths and challenges.\n\nReflecting on the effectiveness of narrative therapy in this case, it's clear that the mother's journey was one of transformation. She moved from a place of anxiety and self-blame to one of understanding and empowerment. By leveraging her own positive energy and love, she found new ways to support her child, ultimately fostering a healthier and more supportive family dynamic.\n\nIn conclusion, this case reaffirms the power of narrative therapy to facilitate self-awareness and change. By focusing on the client's strengths and reframing challenges, we can guide them towards solutions that resonate with their values and aspirations. The mother's experience illustrates how therapeutic interventions can unlock new possibilities, enabling clients to navigate complex situations with confidence and compassion.", "causes": "Personal personality factors and social factors (the child has bad behavior in high school)", "symptoms": "Anxiety, insomnia", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection;\nExternalization techniques in narrative therapy: leading the mother to separate the child's bad behavior from the child's\nown qualities.", "characteristics_of_illness": "The mother's age may have contributed to her increased susceptibility", "treatment_effect": "The establishment of a good counseling relationship effectively\nalleviated the mother's anxiety and worry, strengthened her self-\nconfidence and self-worth, provided her with a new perspective on the problem, and created space for subsequent problem solving."}

Recently, she has felt that her husband has been very flirtatious with a WeChat friend while being very indifferent towards her and their child. She feels that the marriage cannot continue and has developed issues such as insomnia, anxiety, and mood swings. She wants to resolve the marriage crisis through counseling."], "consultation_process": ["The visitor is a 32-year-old woman, and her husband is 35. They met in June 2012 through a colleague and fell in love at first sight. They obtained their marriage license in September of the same year and have been married for five years, with a four-year-old child. Both of them are in second marriages and met during their emotional downtime, later entering into a whirlwind marriage. The husband has one child from his previous marriage, who is raised by his ex-wife. The visitor did not have children in her previous marriage. During the five years of marriage, the first two years were good, but the relationship declined afterward. The main conflict centers around the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law issues. The visitor has a strong personality, and so does her mother-in-law, leading to frequent power struggles as both want to be the mistress of the house, making it difficult for the husband (son) to navigate. At the end of 2016, due to the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law issues, the visitor confronted her mother-in-law in front of her husband, making him uncomfortable. The visitor felt that her husband did not understand her grievances from her perspective, and out of anger, they went to the civil affairs bureau to get a divorce certificate. However, they did not leave home and continued to live together mainly for the sake of their four-year-old child. The child has been suffering from a blood disease since a young age and is undergoing treatment; both parents care for the child and do not want the child to suffer from the impact of a broken marriage. In the five years of marriage, their sexual life was good at the beginning, about once or twice a week. However, due to the visitor's pregnancy and other practical issues, as well as the child's illness after birth, their sexual life has decreased to about once or twice a month. The husband runs a restaurant and often does not return home until 2-3 AM, which is also a factor. They have been living in a long-term separation; the visitor sleeps in one room with the child, while the husband sleeps in another room or on the sofa. In their marital interaction, the visitor has been very dominant, not considering her husband's feelings, preferring to influence him according to her own ways and ideas, which her husband complains about. He feels that his wife does not understand him or care for him enough, and the ongoing mother-in-law and daughter-in-law conflicts make him feel that his wife cannot see things from his perspective or share his pressures. Around May 2017, the visitor noticed her husband was reluctant to come home early. After work at the restaurant, he would drive to the garage and stall there, not going upstairs, and he had a password on his phone that prevented the visitor from seeing it. The husband, who never listened to music, started playing music on his phone every time he used it. He would chat on WeChat until 3-4 AM every night, often laughing at his phone. By chance, the visitor saw her husband's WeChat and discovered frequent, ambiguous chats with a woman, including messages saying, \"You are the woman I love most in this life, I only love you.\" The visitor confirmed that there was a problem. After discovering this, they had fights, and her husband promised that he still valued their family and that his relationship with that woman was just for fun, without any sexual relations. The visitor asked her husband to delete the woman's contact and ensure they would no longer communicate, which he reluctantly did. However, she later found out he had added her back. The couple frequently argued about this woman, and the husband began to respond with indifference and stopped paying attention to the visitor. She felt very sad and found it hard to cope with these marital issues, so she sought help from a psychologist."], "experience_and_reflection": "In reflecting on this case of marital counseling for a husband's infidelity, it becomes clear that a multitude of complex dynamics are at play. These dynamics are rooted in the interpersonal interactions, individual personalities, and external influences that have shaped the couple’s relationship over time. Expanding on the original insights, we delve deeper into the psychological, emotional, and behavioral aspects that define the situation.\n\nFirst, examining the interaction patterns within the marriage reveals significant issues related to communication and emotional connection. The visitor, characterized by her strong will, often fails to empathize with her husband’s experiences and emotional needs. This lack of empathy manifests in a communication style that is more directive and less receptive, where the visitor often imposes her perspective without acknowledging her husband’s feelings. This dynamic can lead to a sense of frustration and diminished self-worth in her husband. Men often seek appreciation, recognition of their abilities, and acknowledgment of their contributions in a relationship. When these needs are unmet, it can create a void that may lead to feelings of neglect and inadequacy.\n\nIn this case, the visitor’s tendency to criticize and blame her husband while taking his contributions for granted exacerbates the situation. This behavior not only suppresses her husband’s motivation to contribute but also fosters a sense of being undervalued and unnecessary. It is crucial for the visitor to recognize the importance of expressing gratitude and acknowledging her husband’s efforts, as these actions can reinforce positive behavior and foster a supportive relationship environment. The visitor’s industrious nature, while beneficial in some aspects, inadvertently leads to her husband’s passivity and detachment. Encouraging her husband to take on responsibilities and actively participate in family life requires a balance of vulnerability and assertiveness from the visitor. By expressing her own needs and inviting her husband to assist, she can create opportunities for collaboration and mutual appreciation.\n\nMoving on to the couple’s sexual relationship, the decline in sexual intimacy is a significant factor contributing to the marital discord. Sexual fulfillment is an integral component of marital satisfaction, serving both as a physical expression of love and a means of emotional bonding. The infrequent sexual encounters reported in this case highlight a disconnect that may have broader implications for the couple’s emotional intimacy. A fulfilling sexual relationship requires both partners to feel desired and valued, and in this scenario, the visitor’s preoccupation with her child’s health and other stressors has led to a neglect of her own and her husband’s sexual needs. Addressing this issue involves a conscious effort to prioritize intimacy and rekindle the sexual connection. This may involve open discussions about desires, experimenting with new ways to enhance intimacy, and making a concerted effort to spend quality time together away from everyday stressors.\n\nFurthermore, the impact of external stressors such as the child’s illness and the husband’s demanding work schedule cannot be overlooked. These factors contribute to the emotional strain within the marriage and exacerbate existing tensions. It is essential for the couple to develop strategies to manage these stressors collectively, perhaps by setting aside regular time for family activities that foster togetherness and strengthen their bond.\n\nThe significance of the marriage certificate also warrants deeper consideration. The symbolic and legal binding nature of a marriage certificate can have profound psychological implications for the couple’s commitment and accountability to each other. In this case, the act of obtaining a divorce certificate, even if not acted upon, represents a pivotal moment in the marriage, indicating a breakdown in the perceived commitment. Reaffirming their marriage through obtaining a new marriage certificate can serve as a renewed commitment to the relationship, symbolizing a fresh start and a mutual willingness to work through the challenges.\n\nDelving into the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law conflict, this issue reflects broader cultural and familial dynamics that impact the marriage. The power struggle between the visitor and her mother-in-law is emblematic of boundary issues and the lack of individuation within the family structure. It is imperative for the couple to establish clear boundaries that respect the autonomy of their marital relationship while acknowledging the role of extended family members. This involves open communication and setting expectations for interactions with the mother-in-law, thereby reducing tension and fostering a more harmonious family environment.\n\nFinally, addressing the issue of the husband’s infidelity requires a nuanced approach that balances accountability with understanding. The visitor’s initial response of anger and demand for her husband to sever ties with the other woman is understandable; however, it is equally important to explore the underlying issues that contributed to the husband’s actions. Infidelity often signifies deeper relational issues, such as unmet emotional needs, lack of communication, or feelings of alienation within the marriage. Engaging in a process of self-reflection can be transformative for the visitor, allowing her to identify areas for personal growth and relational improvement.\n\nEstablishing clear marital boundaries and setting rules for the relationship can provide a framework for rebuilding trust and fostering a sense of security. This involves mutual agreements on issues such as transparency, communication, and fidelity, coupled with a commitment to resolving conflicts constructively. By engaging in this process, the couple can develop a shared vision for their marriage that emphasizes respect, understanding, and mutual support.\n\nIn conclusion, this case highlights the intricate interplay of individual behaviors, relational dynamics, and external influences that shape a marriage. Through a comprehensive approach that addresses communication, intimacy, cultural dynamics, and personal accountability, the couple can work towards resolving their marital issues and building a stronger, more resilient relationship.

She accidentally discovered a photo of a beautiful female streamer on her boyfriend's phone, which led her to investigate further and gradually develop strange thoughts that her boyfriend might have some ambiguous feelings for her."], "consultation_process": ["On a summer afternoon, a girl named Xiaojia came to my psychological counseling studio with a look of helplessness and confusion. She is a rather delicate-looking and slender young woman. During our phone appointment in the morning, I sensed her intense anxiety and bewilderment. After a brief conversation to understand her situation, I informed her that her issues fell within my area of work, and she hurried over in the afternoon. After pouring a glass of water for Xiaojia and inviting her to take a seat, I explained the setup of psychological counseling, including the confidentiality principles that the counselor would adhere to. Xiaojia rubbed her palms together and nodded as she shared her inner confusion with me.\n\nXiaojia is 22 years old and a junior student. She is in a stable relationship with her boyfriend, who is also a university classmate, and they have been dating for six months. Although the purpose of this counseling session was related to emotional issues, the key was not about her boyfriend but rather concerns regarding another girl and some strange thoughts she had about her. Before the summer vacation, Xiaojia inadvertently looked through her boyfriend's phone and discovered some photos of girls, one of which featured a particularly beautiful girl. Xiaojia felt a mix of envy and resentment. When she pressed her boyfriend for answers, he casually told her that the photo was just of a female internet streamer with whom he had no connection.\n\nThis prompted Xiaojia to begin her \"investigation\" of this girl. She started to browse her boyfriend's Weibo and later found the girl's account. During her obsessive search, her feelings began to change; her jealousy gradually faded, and she found herself wanting to pay more attention to the girl, wanting to learn more about her, wanting to talk to her, wanting to meet her. Slowly, she began to perceive her as a goddess. Later, upon looking through the girl's Weibo, she noticed that some of the photos were clearly taken during live streams. I asked her what the relationship between her boyfriend and this girl was. Xiaojia replied that she didn't know, as her boyfriend had never mentioned it.\n\nDriven by curiosity, one night while her boyfriend was asleep, Xiaojia secretly browsed his WeChat Moments, spending the entire night searching for any interactions he had with that girl. She discovered that they had interacted a year prior, with her boyfriend commenting under one of the girl's photos, “Isn’t this my baby?” to which the girl had responded with a rolling eyes emoji. Although Xiaojia felt a twinge of jealousy and discomfort, she reassured herself that at that time, she and her boyfriend had not yet established a romantic relationship. Gradually, she felt less uncomfortable and developed a desire to continue learning about this girl, frequently checking her Weibo. When the girl didn’t update her account for a long time, Xiaojia became anxious, feeling that it was unusual for there to be no activity for such an extended period. She decided to ask her boyfriend for the girl’s live stream room number. Initially, he said he didn’t know, only mentioning the platform. Eventually, after Xiaojia persistently urged him and promised to give him 200 yuan if he told her, he finally provided the information.\n\nXiaojia then went to the girl’s live stream room on the platform her boyfriend provided. Her first viewing was completely different from what she had imagined. The girl appeared goddess-like in photos but very crude in the live stream, making inappropriate jokes and not sounding as sweet as Xiaojia had envisioned. Xiaojia suddenly felt as if “her goddess had been sold to a brothel” and felt an overwhelming desire to save her. In a strange impulse, she sent the girl 200 yuan worth of gifts, interacted with her, and joined her fan group. Additionally, she harbored a peculiar wish for something to happen between the girl and her boyfriend, or for them to have some flirtation, which would make Xiaojia happy. She found it odd that she had such strange thoughts.\n\nLove is selfish, yet Xiaojia had this absurd idea of sharing her boyfriend with someone else, which was quite shocking. Through my counseling interactions with her, I clarified her confusion; Xiaojia liked that girl but was not a lesbian. Her jealousy was not strong; rather, she envied the girl’s beauty and hoped to rescue the female streamer and guide her back to a healthy, meaningful life, pursuing a pure career. Xiaojia sent gifts to increase her chances of interaction with the girl, as the streamer lived in a different sphere from both her and her boyfriend. Xiaojia wanted others to see her as beautiful, and if her boyfriend had some flirtation with that beautiful girl, she felt it would place her on the same level, feeling that she was as beautiful as the girl.\n\nAs the counseling progressed, I learned that Xiaojia was a very ambitious girl but had a low satisfaction level with herself, rating it only 5 out of 10. I asked her to reflect on past events and analyze them one by one. Valuable incidents emerged: over the past six months, Xiaojia had interviewed at several live streaming platforms, but many did not hire her. One platform’s hiring manager explicitly stated that they were looking for beautiful and cute girls, not those who were unattractive. This made Xiaojia feel very insecure and think she was ugly. She constantly hoped to be perceived as beautiful by others. The failure to secure a job was a blow to her, leading her to feel unmotivated during the summer vacation, knowing she should help her parents but lacking the interest. She also felt guilty about using her parents' money to send gifts to a stranger.\n\nOn the other hand, she went out of her way to please others in order to maintain stable relationships. Xiaojia is kind-hearted, but her people-pleasing behavior lacked boundaries, making her stability temporary and fraught with risk. I encouraged her to consider whether she could find a way to convey her reminders or suggestions to a girl doing such inappropriate work. I also asked if there were broader choices available to her beyond being a live streamer. I told Xiaojia that she was not only not ugly but also possessed a unique purity and gentleness. Kindness is her beautiful calling card.\n\nDuring two sessions, I used cognitive therapy and relationship guidance to help her adjust her significantly distorted views on aesthetics and relationships, and I applied hypnosis techniques to enhance her self-confidence. After the consultations, Xiaojia expressed her gratitude and summarized her gains from the two sessions. Regardless of whether she is perceived as beautiful by others, the most important thing is to accept herself. She realized that the thought of wanting her boyfriend to have a fling with that girl was a desecration of her own love and a dangerous game between the sexes. Seeking validation for her appearance through such means is childish and nearly impossible. She recognized that while beauty may attract attention, it is not a passport to happiness or success. Beautiful attributes must be used cautiously, and those who may not be conventionally attractive can enhance their abilities to engage in more meaningful endeavors, especially since she is still relatively pretty!\n\nAfter summarizing, Xiaojia playfully winked at me, and we exchanged knowing smiles."], "experience_and_reflection": "Confidence is our forever good friend; our learning, love, work, and life all rely on confidence. Xiao Jia only lost her confidence for a short period in her life, which caused a lot of troubles, leaving her life lacking in color and vitality. Reflecting on her journey, I realize how deeply intertwined self-perception is with our emotional and relational experiences. Xiao Jia's case serves as a powerful reminder of how critical it is to nurture self-esteem, especially in the formative years of young adulthood when identity and self-worth are still being shaped.\n\nInitially, Xiao Jia's story unfolded as a testament to the complexities of human emotions and relationships. At the core of her distress was not merely jealousy or insecurity but a profound struggle with self-acceptance. Her encounter with the image of the beautiful female streamer on her boyfriend's phone was a catalyst that triggered an avalanche of emotions and introspection. In the beginning, her envy of the girl's beauty was palpable, yet it evolved into something more intricate—a desire to connect, understand, and perhaps emulate what she perceived as an embodiment of beauty and success.\n\nThe journey of unraveling these feelings revealed Xiao Jia's latent fears and aspirations. It became evident that her admiration for the female streamer was not solely about physical appearance; it symbolized her own aspirations for beauty, acceptance, and success. This revelation was crucial in our therapeutic process, as it highlighted the universal human tendency to project our desires and insecurities onto others. In Xiao Jia's case, her fixation on the streamer was a mirror reflecting her own unmet needs and aspirations.\n\nThroughout our sessions, it was important to address the root causes of Xiao Jia's self-doubt. Her experiences with rejection at live streaming job interviews were particularly telling. These incidents not only dented her confidence but also reinforced a narrative of inadequacy. It was here that cognitive therapy played a pivotal role. By challenging and reframing her distorted beliefs about beauty and self-worth, Xiao Jia began to see herself in a new light. We explored the societal and personal pressures that shaped her perceptions, encouraging her to define beauty on her own terms rather than through the often unforgiving lens of social media and societal standards.\n\nAnother significant aspect of our work was helping Xiao Jia understand the importance of boundaries and authenticity in relationships. Her willingness to compromise her values to please others, even to the point of financially supporting a stranger, was indicative of a deep-seated need for approval and connection. This behavior, while stemming from a place of kindness, highlighted the dangers of losing oneself in the pursuit of external validation. Through relationship guidance, we focused on helping her establish healthy boundaries, emphasizing that true connections are built on mutual respect and authenticity rather than self-sacrifice.\n\nHypnosis techniques were employed to bolster Xiao Jia's self-confidence. These sessions were designed to tap into her subconscious mind, reinforcing positive self-affirmations and nurturing a sense of inner strength and resilience. It was gratifying to witness her gradual transformation as she embraced her unique qualities and began to appreciate her intrinsic worth.\n\nXiao Jia's journey also underscored the importance of self-compassion and the courage to confront one's vulnerabilities. In recognizing that her wish for her boyfriend to have a flirtation with the streamer was a misguided attempt to validate her own beauty, she took a significant step towards self-awareness. This realization was crucial in dismantling the unhealthy patterns of thought and behavior that had taken root. She understood that true self-worth is not contingent upon external validation but is an internal state of being that must be nurtured and protected.\n\nReflecting on our sessions, I am struck by the profound impact that societal expectations and media portrayals of beauty can have on young individuals. Xiao Jia's case is a poignant reminder of the need for greater awareness and education around these issues. As clinicians, it is our responsibility to foster environments where individuals feel safe to explore and challenge these constructs, empowering them to forge their own paths to self-acceptance and fulfillment.\n\nIn the aftermath of our sessions, Xiao Jia expressed her gratitude and summarized her gains. She realized that the thought of wanting her boyfriend to have a fling with that girl was a desecration of her own love and a dangerous game between the sexes. Seeking validation for her appearance through such means is childish and nearly impossible. She recognized that while beauty may attract attention, it is not a passport to happiness or success. Beautiful attributes must be used cautiously, and those who may not be conventionally attractive can enhance their abilities to engage in more meaningful endeavors, especially since she is still relatively pretty!\n\nXiao Jia also took proactive steps in her personal growth journey. She reached out to the female streamer, leaving a message that encouraged her to explore more meaningful opportunities in life. The streamer's appreciative response was a testament to Xiao Jia's influence and the positive impact of her newfound confidence. It was a moment of empowerment, demonstrating that Xiao Jia had transitioned from a place of envy and self-doubt to one of compassion and self-assuredness.\n\nI am very happy for Xiao Jia and told her, \"In interpersonal relationships, we must learn to integrate while also knowing when to detach. We should always carry confidence forward; we have ample inner strength to face many things. Once we choose a partner, we should walk hand in hand into the future and cherish each moment!\" Love, emotions, personal growth, marriage, family, gratitude, and education are truly inspiring. In reflecting on Xiao Jia's journey, I am reminded of the resilience of the human spirit and the transformative power of therapeutic interventions. Her story is a testament to the fact that with the right support and guidance, individuals can overcome their insecurities, embrace their authentic selves, and build fulfilling, meaningful lives.", "causes": "Personal personality factors, past life events", "symptoms": "Obsessive beliefs", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection;\nPsychoanalysis: Exploring the underlying events that induce irrational beliefs;\nCognitive therapy: Improves self-perception\nHypnotherapy: Boosts self-confidence and self-worth.", "characteristics_of_illness": "An irrational belief born out of a desire for outside recognition", "treatment_effect": "It helps clients to explore and understand the causes of irrational\nbeliefs, enhance their self-confidence and self-esteem, improve their    self-acceptance, establish more constructive values, and improve their\nadaptability and resilience in future studies and lives."}

The patient's husband reported that the patient's condition began three years ago, initially interfering with his normal work, and later questioning his father-in-law, who has Alzheimer's disease, and his mother-in-law, who has heart disease, about why their granddaughter was attending school in Xiangtan, which seemed abnormal. Unable to bear his wife's nagging, he sought companionship outside the marriage, leading to him leaving home early and returning late without speaking to his wife for nearly six months, which might have greatly affected her. Seeing his wife's condition worsen, he now basically stays home after work and visits his parents once or twice a week. The wife has thoughts about her husband accompanying his parents, feeling that his siblings should also share the responsibility, questioning why her husband visits them more frequently. The husband believes that as the youngest child living nearby, it is only natural to spend more time with his parents, who do not need their children to take care of them since they are retired and instead help him out occasionally. Considering his wife is the patient, he doesn't want her to take care of his parents and feels he must check in on them and have meals together. He bought books by Ma Yueling and others for his wife to read and got a foot bath tub at home to encourage her to soak her feet. He even bumped into door frames and tapped his gallbladder meridian, but his wife did not cooperate and thought he was angry when she saw him bumping into the door frame. She often secretly checked his phone calls and wrote down the numbers to call them back. To pressure her husband to find a mistress and to urge their daughter to marry, she frequently called her husband's friends and her daughter's boyfriend, making 8 to 9 calls a day. When at home, she incessantly nagged about these two issues, although in reality, her husband was not seeking a mistress and their daughter was not rushing into marriage. However, if her husband were to find a mistress and their daughter were to get married, her problems might worsen, as her focus is primarily on her husband and daughter. She worries about them constantly, speaking as if arranging funeral matters. She is dissatisfied with her daughter's boyfriend's family in Sichuan, frequently calling her daughter's supervisor to request a transfer, and calling her daughter's boyfriend, bordering on harassment. Their daughter and her boyfriend considered turning off their phones, unsure if that would hurt her feelings. The husband stated that their family's financial situation in Changsha is average, and they are not struggling to make ends meet. The wife was transferred from the supply and marketing system to the Hunan Construction Group’s guesthouse, which later changed into a hotel. The original staff received only 1,000 yuan a month without being assigned any work. After working briefly at another guesthouse, she was dismissed, leading to her depression. She has few friends and no hobbies beyond grocery shopping and window shopping, often staying at home. She frequently finds herself touching her body, fearing lymphatic issues and cancer. She constantly revisits old topics; if ignored, she writes notes for her husband to read, and if he responds, it leads to further complications. Both her husband and daughter have strong personalities, firm in their beliefs and unwilling to compromise. When frustrated, they avoid meeting. The husband sometimes returns home at 11 PM and leaves early the next morning, spending most of his time in the office, while their daughter, working in Zhuzhou, keeps her phone off. The husband worries that if this continues, it will affect their daughter's marriage prospects and disrupt the normal work and life of both him and their daughter. He believes his wife trusts nothing, does not believe in fate, has no faith, and spends her days lost in wild thoughts, unwilling to listen to advice.", "The counselor informs that psychological counseling involves the counselor using psychological theories and techniques to help the patient clarify issues and learn to help themselves.

The patient should continue taking traditional Chinese medicine to regulate qi and blood and combat depression, while also engaging in acupressure (Tai Chong point, Dan Zhong point, Chong Da Shu point) and soaking their feet for half an hour before bed. Family members should show more tolerance, understanding, care, and concern for the patient, listening more and speaking less, avoiding attempts to persuade or change the patient, but instead integrating into their experience to draw them out. They should first empathize with the patient's suffering from her perspective and gradually guide her out of her tangled thought patterns and emotions. It would be even better if the patient could re-enter the workforce and participate in social activities, as this would help restore her social functioning.

Integrate the patient's personality using imagery personality decomposition techniques to achieve self-balance and harmony; hypnosis methods can also be used when necessary."], "experience_and_reflection": "In reflecting upon this case, it becomes evident that hypochondriasis, particularly when intertwined with menopausal syndrome, presents a complex tapestry of psychological and physiological symptoms. The patient, a 47-year-old woman, provides a poignant example of how hypochondriasis can manifest and persist despite numerous medical consultations and negative test results. Her case underscores the intricate interplay between psychological distress and physical health concerns, especially during significant life transitions such as menopause.\n\nHypochondriasis, as observed in this case, is not merely an irrational fear of illness but a deeply ingrained pattern of thought that significantly impairs the patient's social and familial functioning. This condition is marked by an excessive preoccupation with the belief of having a serious illness, a belief that persists even in the face of medical reassurance. The patient's experience highlights how hypochondriasis can lead to a self-perpetuating cycle of anxiety and health-related behaviors that reinforce the individual's fears rather than alleviate them.\n\nClinically, it is crucial to recognize that hypochondriasis often coexists with other psychological disorders, such as depression and anxiety, which may exacerbate the patient's symptoms. In this case, the patient's menopausal syndrome likely contributed to her emotional volatility and heightened health anxiety, as hormonal changes during menopause can impact mood and cognitive functioning. This interplay between menopause and hypochondriasis suggests that treatment approaches should be multifaceted, addressing both the psychological and physiological aspects of the patient's condition.\n\nThe family dynamics observed in this case further complicate the therapeutic landscape. The patient's persistent health concerns and the resultant behaviors, such as incessant phone calls and the refusal to work, have placed a significant strain on her family relationships. Her husband's extramarital companionship, albeit driven by his inability to cope with the situation, has further intensified the patient's feelings of worthlessness and self-blame. This familial context is critical, as it highlights the importance of involving family members in the therapeutic process to foster a supportive environment that facilitates the patient's recovery.\n\nReflecting on the therapeutic interventions used, it is evident that family therapy played a pivotal role in addressing the relational aspects of the patient's condition. However, the patient's reluctance to engage in psychological counseling poses a significant challenge. Her identification with the \"professional patient\" role, combined with secondary gains from her illness, such as attention and exemption from responsibilities, hinders therapeutic progress. This resistance necessitates a delicate balance between validating the patient's distress and gently challenging her maladaptive beliefs and behaviors.\n\nThe consultation process revealed the patient's profound sense of regret and self-blame, particularly regarding past medical decisions and her perceived failures as a wife and mother. These cognitions are characteristic of depressive disorders and suggest that cognitive-behavioral interventions aimed at restructuring negative thought patterns could be beneficial. Additionally, the use of hypnosis to explore subconscious fears and beliefs offers a promising avenue for uncovering deeper psychological issues that may be fueling the patient's hypochondriasis.\n\nFrom a treatment perspective, the integration of traditional Chinese medicine, focusing on regulating qi and blood, provides a complementary approach to Western psychological and pharmacological interventions. This holistic strategy acknowledges the cultural and personal preferences of the patient and may enhance her receptivity to treatment. Encouraging the patient to engage in social activities and re-enter the workforce is also essential, as these experiences can help restore her sense of purpose and improve her social functioning.\n\nReflecting on the broader implications of this case, it becomes clear that hypochondriasis during menopause is a multifactorial condition that requires a comprehensive and individualized treatment plan. The prolonged duration of the patient's symptoms suggests that therapy must be sustained and adaptive to address the evolving nature of her condition. Patience and persistence are crucial, as therapeutic progress may be gradual and require adjustments based on the patient's responsiveness to different interventions.\n\nIn conclusion, this case highlights the complexity of hypochondriasis during menopausal syndrome and underscores the need for an integrative therapeutic approach that addresses the psychological, physiological, and relational dimensions of the patient's condition. As clinicians, we must remain attuned to the unique challenges faced by patients with hypochondriasis and strive to create a therapeutic environment that fosters healing and empowerment. This case serves as a reminder of the resilience of the human spirit and the capacity for growth and change, even in the face of chronic psychological distress.", "causes": "Biological, past medical history, and social factors (family relationships, job changes)", "symptoms": "Depression, social anxiety, hypochondriasis", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection;\n\nPsychological Assessment: Tree Personality Projection Test and Scale Measurement;\nHumanistic Therapy: Listening, Empathy; imagery dialogue;\ncognitive-behavioral therapy; Hypnotherapy\nFamily system therapy.", "characteristics_of_illness": "menopause", "treatment_effect": "The treatment strategy based on traditional Chinese medicine and supplemented by psychological counseling helps clients explore and    discover their own unreasonable cognitions, especially negative\ncognitions of the self, and realize that their bad emotions are caused by unreasonable beliefs, which can effectively alleviate their bad\nemotions.

Although there will surely be ups and downs ahead, I hope all this pain can be transformed into wealth, helping him become stronger and healthier!"], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on my journey with Xiaofeng, I am reminded of the complex interplay of individual temperament, family dynamics, and societal expectations that shape our clients' inner worlds. Xiaofeng's case presented a unique confluence of challenges due to his Asperger's syndrome, obsessive-compulsive tendencies, and deeply rooted emotional scars from past interactions with peers, particularly with \"Wang.\" These elements formed a tapestry of distress that required a nuanced therapeutic approach.\n\nOne of the pivotal moments in our sessions was the realization of the profound impact that Xiaofeng's family environment had on his mental health. His father's engineering background, characterized by a methodical and reserved nature, juxtaposed with his mother's impatience, created a home atmosphere that, while stable, lacked emotional warmth and spontaneity. This environment, combined with the intense focus on academic achievement, contributed to Xiaofeng's feelings of isolation and inadequacy. It was crucial to address these familial influences through family system therapy, which became a cornerstone of our work.\n\nFamily system therapy allowed us to delve into the undercurrents of Xiaofeng's upbringing, illuminating the conflicting educational philosophies between his parents. This discord, though subtle, translated into a pressure-cooker environment for Xiaofeng, where academic success was prioritized over personal happiness and emotional expression. The realization that Xiaofeng had been navigating his world with a narrow set of interests and a lack of joyful experiences was a critical insight. His parents' awakening to the importance of fostering a more vibrant and nurturing family atmosphere was a breakthrough that set the stage for positive change.\n\nOur outdoor experience was an innovative intervention designed to shift the family's dynamic from one of rigidity to one of spontaneity and joy. The hike, interspersed with games and laughter, was more than a simple recreational activity; it was a transformative experience that allowed the family to connect on a deeper level. This intervention highlighted the therapeutic potential of experiential learning, where clients can embody new ways of being in the world outside the confines of a therapy room. The family's shared joy during this experience underscored the therapeutic principle that emotional healing often requires an environment where one can feel safe to explore and express themselves authentically.\n\nXiaofeng's cognitive distortions, such as mind reading, emotional reasoning, and overgeneralization, were critical areas of focus in our cognitive behavioral therapy sessions. These distortions fueled his obsessive thoughts and vengeful desires, creating a cycle of suffering that was difficult to break. By teaching Xiaofeng to identify and challenge these distortions, we provided him with tools to reinterpret his experiences and reduce the emotional intensity of his thoughts. This cognitive restructuring was crucial in helping him transition from a state of emotional reactivity to one of reflective response.\n\nThe use of hypnotherapy, though initially met with resistance, served as an important tool for helping Xiaofeng access a state of relaxation and temporary reprieve from his persistent distress. His skepticism about the enduring effects of hypnosis was an honest reflection of his struggle with the impermanence of relief. This resistance, while challenging, was also a testament to Xiaofeng's keen insight into his emotional world and his desire for lasting change. It prompted us to pivot to other therapeutic modalities, which ultimately proved more effective in addressing the root causes of his distress.\n\nMorita therapy provided a philosophical framework that resonated deeply with Xiaofeng. The concept of accepting thoughts without resistance and focusing on action rather than rumination was a powerful antidote to his compulsive need for revenge. This approach encouraged Xiaofeng to embrace the fluidity of his emotions and recognize that suffering is often perpetuated by our attempts to control or escape it. By learning to \"go with the flow,\" Xiaofeng began to cultivate a sense of inner peace and resilience, which was reflected in his stabilized emotions and reduced pain levels.\n\nThe therapeutic journey with Xiaofeng was not without its moments of difficulty and self-doubt. As a clinician, encountering resistance or feeling attacked can be disheartening, yet these moments also serve as valuable opportunities for growth and learning. Xiaofeng's candid feedback challenged me to remain flexible and adaptive in my approach, reinforcing the importance of meeting clients where they are and collaboratively navigating the therapeutic process.\n\nXiaofeng's case also highlighted the critical role of early identification and intervention for individuals with Asperger's syndrome. His experiences underscored the challenges faced by those with social communication difficulties, including loneliness, social withdrawal, and aggression. These difficulties are not merely behavioral; they are deeply intertwined with the individual's perception of the world and their place within it. For Xiaofeng, the desire for social connection was palpable, yet his inability to decipher social cues left him feeling alienated and misunderstood. This gap between desire and ability necessitates ongoing support and training to help individuals like Xiaofeng build the skills needed for meaningful social interactions.\n\nAs Xiaofeng prepares to return to school, I am hopeful that the insights and tools gained through our work together will serve him well. His journey is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the capacity for growth even in the face of significant challenges. While the path ahead may still hold uncertainties, I am confident that Xiaofeng's newfound understanding of himself and his emotions will empower him to navigate life's complexities with greater confidence and grace.\n\nIn reflecting on this case, I am reminded of the profound impact that a supportive therapeutic alliance can have on a client's journey toward healing. Xiaofeng's courage and perseverance in confronting his inner demons inspire me as a clinician to continue striving for deeper understanding and more effective interventions. Ultimately, this case has reinforced my belief in the transformative power of therapy and the potential for every individual to find their own path to healing and fulfillment.", "causes": "Personal personality factors, upbringing, and past life\nevents", "symptoms": "Asperger's syndrome, depression, obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder, self-harm, and hurtful tendencies", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection;\nHypnotherapy: guiding them into their natural environment or reliving fond childhood memories;\nMeditation and imagery dialogue: expressing emotions\nthrough painting, then visualizing the emotions as a boat,\nplacing them in the sea to experience the lightness of emotions leaving the body;\nFamily Systems Therapy: In-depth analysis of the family atmosphere and internal problems;\nOutdoor experiential activities: experience the role of relaxation and pleasure in building family relationships;\nMorita Therapy: Guiding them to realize that thoughts and emotions cannot be suppressed but must flow naturally;\nCognitive-behavioral therapy: generalization, mind reading, and other common causes of irrational beliefs;\nSolution-focused therapy: Ask questions with a measuring stick.", "characteristics_of_illness": "A type of autism spectrum", "treatment_effect": "It helps the client to relieve negative emotions, deeply relax\nphysically and mentally, greatly reduce the pain score, and are willing to return to school to continue their studies, and make parents aware of the impact of the family atmosphere on their children and take corresponding measures to improve it."}

Although my husband has a bad temper, he is quite hardworking, and our relationship has been okay over the past few years. He works at a remote township government office and rarely comes home, only returning on weekends. I work at a factory, and our family income is decent. For the past two years, my mother has been helping me take care of the children, while my relationship with my mother-in-law is just average. I usually visit her during holidays, and she lives with her younger son and daughter-in-law, helping them with school drop-offs and pick-ups. The house they live in was purchased by my in-laws for their younger son; my in-laws did not give me anything when I got married. After my child was born, my mother had time to help me with childcare and household chores. Last month, my brother's wife gave birth, and my mother went to help her with postpartum care. Both my husband and I had to work, so my mother-in-law volunteered to help, and my husband supported this, so I didn’t say much. When my mother was here, I didn’t have to worry about household matters, but after my mother-in-law came, she didn’t clean at all. She even wanted me to wash her clothes when I got home from work, only helping a bit with cooking and looking after the kids. If she were taking care of the children well, it would be fine, but every afternoon she would go to the mahjong room, leaving the child to play by himself, making him dirty. I didn’t know how to address this with her, so I called my husband to talk about it, but he scolded me instead. Usually, I don’t talk much to her at home, and sometimes I get angry and take it out on the child. One night, while she was feeding the child, she chewed up some beans to feed him, and when I saw this, I got furious and argued with her, saying how could she let the child eat something she had chewed that was so dirty? She got angry and said both her sons were raised this way. I was so mad that I smashed the bowl and took the child into the house, slamming the door and crying. When my husband called that night, he scolded me before I could explain, saying my mother-in-law was helping to take care of the child and I should be more accommodating. I didn’t expect my mother-in-law would complain first. I ended up arguing with my husband. The next morning, when I saw that my mother-in-law wasn’t home, I got even angrier. I had no choice but to have a simple meal and let a neighbor look after the child for a while. I couldn’t concentrate at work that morning, and because I was distracted, I almost hurt my hand on the assembly line. I feel that my mother-in-law is completely different from my mother, but there’s nothing I can do. I can’t let my mom stop taking care of my sister-in-law just to help me. The thought of having to live with her long-term makes me very anxious, and I can’t sleep well at night. I wake up in the middle of the night thinking about it and can’t fall back asleep. I keep ruminating on this, making myself irritable and anxious, losing my appetite and sleep, and feeling particularly bad. I can’t discuss this with my mother because I don’t want her to worry, and I don’t have trustworthy friends to talk to.

It is a common point of tension, often exacerbated by differing backgrounds, values, and expectations. In this case, the complexities of this relationship are vividly illustrated, providing a fertile ground for clinical exploration and reflection.\n\nThe initial observation here is the apparent clash of expectations and cultural norms. The help-seeker, a young woman who has expressed feelings of anxiety and frustration, finds herself caught between her own expectations of what familial support should look like and the reality of her current situation. Her narrative provides insight into a traditional family structure, where the mother-in-law assumes the role of caregiver, albeit in a manner that conflicts with the help-seeker's standards and desires. This dissonance highlights the critical role that communication plays in family dynamics. It underscores the need for clear expectations and open dialogue, which, if absent, can lead to misunderstandings and emotional distress.\n\nFrom a clinical perspective, the application of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) in this scenario is particularly illuminating. REBT focuses on identifying and challenging irrational beliefs, which often underpin emotional turmoil. In the case of our help-seeker, her beliefs about her mother-in-law's obligations and her own perceived injustices serve as significant sources of distress. By using the ABC model of REBT, the clinician can help the help-seeker delineate the activating events (A), her beliefs (B), and the emotional and behavioral consequences (C). This process facilitates a deeper understanding of how her interpretations and expectations are contributing to her anxiety and irritability.\n\nThe help-seeker’s belief that her mother-in-law should fulfill certain duties reflects a rigid expectation that can lead to disappointment and anger when unmet. In challenging these beliefs, the clinician aids the help-seeker in recognizing that her mother-in-law’s actions, while not aligning with her own standards, are not inherently malicious or neglectful. Instead, they are a reflection of different cultural and generational perspectives. This reframing is crucial as it opens the door to empathy and understanding, reducing the emotional charge of the situation.\n\nThe clinician's role here extends beyond merely identifying and disputing irrational beliefs; it involves facilitating a shift in the help-seeker's perspective from one of entitlement to one of gratitude and acceptance. This shift is not about dismissing her feelings but rather about broadening her understanding of the situation. By encouraging her to recognize her mother-in-law’s autonomy and the voluntary nature of her assistance, the help-seeker can begin to appreciate the support she does receive, albeit imperfectly.\n\nAnother layer of complexity in this case is the role of the husband, who becomes a pivotal figure in mediating the relationship between his mother and his wife. His perceived lack of support adds another dimension to the help-seeker's emotional burden. Here, the clinician can guide the help-seeker in exploring her expectations of her husband’s role and the importance of his support. The clinician can encourage open communication between the couple, fostering a partnership approach to resolving familial tensions. This approach emphasizes the need for mutual respect and understanding, recognizing that both partners may have different perspectives but share common goals.\n\nMoreover, the clinician can explore the help-seeker’s internalized beliefs about marriage and family obligations, which are influenced by societal and cultural norms. The belief that marriage should come with certain material conditions, such as owning a home, is one such norm that the help-seeker grapples with. By examining these beliefs, the clinician helps the help-seeker understand that these are not universal truths but rather socially constructed expectations that can be re-evaluated.\n\nThe help-seeker’s journey through therapy is also about developing resilience and coping strategies. In this case, the clinician introduces relaxation exercises and mindfulness techniques to help manage her anxiety and improve her emotional regulation. These tools are invaluable in helping the help-seeker maintain her composure in challenging situations and provide her with a sense of control over her emotional responses.\n\nThe case also presents an opportunity for the clinician to reflect on the broader implications of familial roles and expectations. It invites a consideration of how societal changes, such as increased workforce participation by women and evolving family structures, impact traditional roles and expectations within families. The clinician can ponder the importance of flexibility and adaptability in familial roles, encouraging families to redefine their expectations in ways that align with their unique circumstances and values.\n\nUltimately, this case is a testament to the power of psychotherapy in facilitating personal growth and interpersonal understanding. It highlights the importance of addressing not just the symptoms of distress but also the underlying beliefs and values that contribute to familial tensions. Through the therapeutic process, the help-seeker is empowered to reframe her experiences, develop healthier beliefs, and cultivate a more harmonious relationship with her mother-in-law.\n\nIn conclusion, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law relationship, as explored in this case, is a microcosm of broader societal dynamics, illustrating the intricate interplay between personal beliefs, cultural norms, and familial roles. The clinician's task is to guide the help-seeker in navigating these complexities, fostering insight, empathy, and resilience. This case serves as a valuable reminder of the transformative potential of therapy in helping individuals and families build more fulfilling and supportive relationships.", "causes": "Personal personality factors, current life events, social factors (interpersonal support, raising children)", "symptoms": "Anxiety, depression, irritability, decreased sleep quality", "treatment_process": "basic information gathering and relationship building; psychological assessment;\nRational Emotional Behavior Therapy: Explores irrational\nbeliefs and the underlying events that lead to beliefs, and uses Socrates'low debate to trigger their irrational beliefs;\nNarrative Therapy: Guiding them to look at their choices and problems from a new perspective;\nRelaxation training.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Influenced by social norms, such as having to buy a house to get married", "treatment_effect": "Help the client to eliminate the bad emotions caused by\nunreasonable beliefs, gain a new perspective on the problem, and realize that their bad emotions are caused by \"absolutist\nrequirements\"; Relaxation skills have been mastered, and emotional regulation and problem-solving skills have been improved."}
{"id": 36, "case_description": ["Daughter, a junior in college, dislikes boys who are overly slick and resents male chauvinism."], "consultation_process": ["As I forged ahead through thorns and obstacles, carving paths through mountains and building bridges over waters, steadfastly walking the road of self-growth, breaking through my limitations step by step, witnessing a broader and more dimensional world, and enjoying the joy of traversing time and space, I suddenly turned back and saw my daughter, whom I take pride in for attending a top university in the country, standing at the crossroads of youth, confused and hesitant. Her face was filled with fear, resistance, and rejection of the male world. At an age when she should be loving and loved, she unconsciously locks her heart and shields herself from any information from another world. What has happened to my child? Her state reminds me: Where did things go wrong?", "The daughter said nothing, only that besides her dad and younger brother, she is most familiar with and trusts them the most. She likes them and loves them, but she is very indifferent and resistant to other unfamiliar or even strange men, almost never interacting with them. What is the child afraid of? Is it my struggles and efforts along the way that have scared her? Or has she encountered some harm in her own growth experience that has caused her to close the door to another world?", "To be fair, my daughter knows the hardships and pains I have endured throughout my journey. Because of her deep love and loyalty to me, she has taken on too much of my suffering and sorrow. To be honest, I do love my child's father, but there are some old beliefs and tenets he holds that I cannot agree with. Therefore, in our marriage, there is both tenderness and affection, as well as smoke and conflict that are irreconcilable. For example, the child's father believes that men should work outside while women take care of the home, which he sees as natural. He strives to handle matters outside well, providing a stable home for me and the child, making us proud of him. In this regard, he does a great job, and both the child and I enjoy the fruits of his efforts. However, what he accomplishes, he also expects me to achieve, which has become an invisible shackle that binds me. He demands that I wholeheartedly take care of our home, keep it organized, and raise our child to be outstanding, allowing him to work without worries. His demands are not unreasonable, but if I were to spend my life confined to his framework of being a supportive wife and mother, I simply cannot do it. When I occasionally attempt to break away from the path my partner has set, going out to learn and freely pursue myself, he becomes extremely angry. No matter how low I bow to appease him, it is difficult to quell his rage, and he harshly reprimands me for neglecting the family. My daughter sees and remembers all of this; she is deeply afraid. If entering marriage means a woman must abandon her own pursuits and aspirations to fully serve the family and children, then my daughter is confused. She has the ability to support herself, so why should she put on an invisible shackle? She has her own dreams and aspirations and is determined not to live like me, losing herself and becoming a subordinate to a man.", "Moreover, the child's father is the kind of man who has high emotional intelligence in a man's world but despises trying to understand a woman's thoughts. In his view, a good man should venture out and create a world for himself, and when he returns home, he should be treated gently, like a victorious warrior. A good woman should be tender and nurturing, embracing and warming like the earth, illuminating everyone in the home with the brilliance of maternal love. As a well-educated woman of the new era, I can meet my partner's expectations, but I also need to have a career I am passionate about and a group of like-minded partners to do meaningful things together while fulfilling my roles as a wife and a mother. This is something my partner does not allow. He acts like a high-definition camera, constantly monitoring whether I am at home; being at home means it's a sunny day, otherwise, it's a storm. For this reason, I have been struggling; I want to be the person I want to be, not the person he expects me to be. Since the birth of our daughter 21 years ago, my partner has been in control while I have been resisting. In this game, we have had arguments, cried, and even thought about separating in anger. Every day when our daughter opens her eyes, she witnesses this unscripted drama; she is terrified, fearing that if she wants to live her own life one day, she might have to pay the same price I have. Instead of spending a lifetime trying to break free from control, why should one voluntarily fall into the trap?", "There’s one more thing, which is in my partner's view: women should not be spoiled. In this new era, my partner absolutely won’t hit me, but he also definitely won’t indulge me. What I lacked the most in my original family was this aspect; my parents, let alone spoil me, didn’t even know how to express basic care and love. I am a person who lacks love, yet I happen to encounter someone who has no intention of indulging me at all. The psychological gap from that is hard for someone who hasn’t experienced it to understand. Whenever I feel wronged or in pain and want to lean on my partner’s shoulder for a good cry, instead of comforting me, he immediately jumps up and starts lecturing me with countless reasons, patiently instructing me to be strong and to dry my tears and face things bravely. Every time, my tears flow like a dam bursting, but when it comes to my partner, I have to force them back. Each time, it’s like I’m holding back a massive wave inside, my face distorts and contorts, and I feel like a balloon about to burst. When I can no longer contain my emotions and they finally overflow, that’s when the damage is the greatest. Because my partner doesn’t know how to channel my emotions, he often becomes the first target of my attacks. His good intentions are met with my angry outbursts, and he becomes furious in return. Then, the doomsday horror show in our home begins. Our daughter, whether she wants to or not, has to watch; she can only anxiously observe while trying to find ways to calm our emotions and work towards restoring normalcy in the family. Unintentionally, our daughter absorbs my emotions. She cannot understand why a problem that could be solved with a simple hug must be met with so many reasons from dad. Why, when reason doesn’t work, does dad keep denying mom's feelings? Why, when mom is already so exhausted and just needs a little understanding from dad to rest and recharge, are dad’s stern words filled only with demands and he refuses to let mom off the hook? The more angry I am, the more sad she becomes; the more sad I am, the more fearful she gets. She is determined not to follow in my old footsteps. If all men in the world are shaped by reason, she would rather be alone, never stepping into that terrifying world.", "When my daughter was in middle school, she developed a lot of acne on her face. Her originally fair skin turned into a bumpy, bright red mess. Coupled with the hormonal changes of puberty, if she didn't wash her hair in time, it would be all messy. All of this started to make her lose confidence; occasionally, when she looked in the mirror, she would be shocked by her own appearance. The more she felt this way, the more she cared about others' opinions, afraid that people would dislike her. At that time, I had just given birth to my son and was exhausted, so I couldn't pay much attention to my daughter. Sometimes when I spoke to her, I rarely considered her feelings. At school, some mean boys would maliciously gossip behind her back, saying hurtful things about how ugly she looked, which greatly undermined her confidence and self-esteem, pushing her to the brink of hating boys. My daughter is a strong-willed child; she didn't want to be someone others looked down on. So she started to work hard in her studies and pursued her dreams with determination, leading to her later success. Now, the acne on her face has disappeared, and she has fair skin, sparkling eyes, and a tall figure. I even doubt whether she is really my biological daughter. How could I, a mother who is under 1.6 meters tall and plump, give birth to such a tall beauty who is nearly 1.7 meters? It truly feels like a genetic mutation!", "I don't want my daughter to experience the hardships I've gone through, but she is currently facing the same struggles I once faced; I don't want her to take the wrong paths I've taken, but she is walking the same winding roads I walked. My daughter has witnessed the difficulties and journeys I endured in the process of becoming myself. Because she loves me, she unconditionally fights against the control, arrogance, and rigidity of men on my behalf. Whatever I resist, she resists; whatever I hate, she hates. It’s truly frightening to think about—children’s hearts are inherently pure and untainted, but because she has received life from me, she uses her small body to support and protect me, helping me become myself. Yet in the process of protecting me, she has been frightened and has borne too much sorrow on my behalf. Thus, unknowingly, she has lost her way in the journey of becoming herself.", "I held my dear child tightly and wiped away her tears: \"Dear child, thank you for always being by my side, helping me bear so much sadness and fear. Child, please give my sadness and fear back to me; they belong to me and are a part of my destiny. You are just my child; you cannot help me with what belongs to me. I will bear it myself. Child, you have your own destiny, you have your own life. If your life is different from mine, it means you love me; if you live happily and joyfully, it means you love me; if you find a warm and caring partner, that is the best way for you to repay me. Dear child, go pursue your happiness; I will always bless you here.\" When I said this, I felt my daughter relax. She looked at me with doubt, as if asking, \"Mom, is this true?\" I looked at her firmly: \"Yes, my dear, it is true. You are born of me, but you do not belong to me; you belong to this world. You are free, go boldly pursue your happiness. Your dad and I will always support and bless you!\" After my daughter confirmed that I was sincere, she slowly left my embrace and ran towards her future, her happy and fulfilling life...", "Life is full of entanglements. When I strive to become myself and break the chains that bind me, my child has already left her position to become my little spokesperson. We are entangled because of love, and we will also reconcile because of love. My child loves me and wants to help me without hesitation. When I see the cause and effect, I will voluntarily let go of my child's hand, learn to take responsibility for myself, and learn to give my child freedom and blessings from my position as a mother. I will allow my child to live differently from me, and allow her to lead a more fulfilling and abundant life built upon my foundation.", "I believe that with my permission and blessing, my daughter will live more and more easily. As for the ugly word that male classmates whispered about during her middle school years, it has long since faded into the past along with her beautiful transformation. I am confident that my daughter will continue to thrive, and I believe she will let go of her unconditional love and loyalty towards me, return to her own position, live her own life well, make good use of the life I have given her, do more meaningful things, and become our pride and glory."], "experience_and_reflection": "In reflecting on this case, it becomes apparent that the journey of psychotherapy is not just about the individual seeking guidance but often involves an intricate web of relationships, emotions, and historical contexts. This consultation with my daughter served not only as an avenue for her healing but also as a profound exploration of my own personal growth and the dynamics within our family. Through this process, I have come to a deeper understanding of the love and loyalty shared between a parent and child, the impact of familial roles and expectations, and the importance of personal liberation within the context of family systems.\n\nInitially, I was struck by my daughter's resistance and apprehension towards men outside of her immediate family circle. It was a perplexing situation, given her age and the natural inclination towards forming relationships. As I delved deeper into this issue, I realized that her behavior was not merely an isolated incident but rather a reflection of the environment she had been raised in—a mirror of my own struggles and battles with societal and marital expectations. This realization was both humbling and enlightening.\n\nThe root of my daughter's apprehension seemed to lie in her observation of my own life and struggles. She had grown up witnessing the dichotomy within our household—the tender moments interwoven with underlying tension and conflict. My husband, despite his admirable qualities and dedication to providing for the family, held views that often clashed with my aspirations for personal growth and independence. His belief in traditional gender roles, while not uncommon, became a source of contention and a barrier to my own self-fulfillment. This created an environment where my daughter was an inadvertent observer of a silent battle—a battle where she saw her mother striving to carve out an identity beyond the confines of societal and marital expectations.\n\nIn this context, my daughter's loyalty to me and her subsequent rejection of other men can be understood as a protective mechanism. She internalized the conflict she witnessed and, in her innocence, chose to shield herself from potential harm by mirroring my resistance. Her love and loyalty became a double-edged sword—supporting me while inadvertently trapping her in a narrative that was not her own.\n\nUnderstanding this dynamic compelled me to confront my own role in perpetuating these patterns. As a mother and clinician, I realized the necessity of owning my journey, my struggles, and my limitations. It was crucial to acknowledge that while my daughter and I are connected, her life is her own to lead. This insight led to a pivotal moment in our consultation, where I had to verbalize and internalize the idea that my daughter must be free to pursue her happiness and fulfillment, independent of my own experiences and struggles.\n\nThis realization was transformative. It required a shift in perspective—from seeing my daughter as an extension of my struggles to recognizing her as an individual with her own path. By releasing her from the burden of my emotional battles, I could foster a healthier dynamic where she felt empowered to explore her identity without the weight of my history. This shift was not merely a verbal declaration but a deep, heartfelt understanding that had to permeate every interaction and decision moving forward.\n\nIn exploring this case, I also came to appreciate the complex role of the family system in shaping individual identities. My husband's expectations, while rooted in traditional norms, were not isolated but part of a broader societal framework that we both navigated. His approach to parenting and partnership, though challenging for me, stemmed from his own upbringing and understanding of gender roles. Recognizing this allowed me to approach the situation with empathy rather than resentment, understanding that his intentions, though misplaced at times, were rooted in a desire to fulfill his perceived responsibilities.\n\nThis understanding opened up a pathway for dialogue and potential reconciliation—not just between my husband and me, but also within the broader family dynamic. It became clear that for our daughter to truly flourish, there needed to be a shift in the way we as parents approached our roles and communicated our expectations. This involved not only supporting her independence but also modeling a healthier partnership dynamic, where mutual respect and understanding were at the forefront.\n\nFurthermore, my daughter's experiences with bullying and self-esteem issues during her middle school years added another layer to this complex narrative. Her struggles with acne and the cruel remarks from her peers served as catalysts for her retreat into a world where she could control her success and identity—academics. This retreat, while productive in terms of her achievements, further alienated her from forming meaningful connections with her peers, particularly boys. It was a protective mechanism that allowed her to shield herself from judgment, yet it also reinforced her fears and insecurities about male interactions.\n\nAddressing this aspect required a delicate balance of empathy and encouragement. It was vital to validate her experiences and the pain they caused while gently guiding her towards understanding that these past experiences did not define her present or future. This required creating a safe space where she felt supported in exploring her identity beyond academic success and embracing her social and emotional growth.\n\nThe consultation process, therefore, evolved into a multifaceted exploration of personal, familial, and societal dynamics. It required an honest assessment of the roles we each played within the family and the courage to confront the uncomfortable truths that lay beneath the surface. Through this process, I learned the importance of vulnerability and openness in fostering authentic connections and promoting healing.\n\nUltimately, this case taught me that personal growth is not a solitary journey but one that intertwines with the lives of those we hold dear. It highlighted the necessity of balancing our desires for self-fulfillment with the responsibilities we hold as members of a family. It underscored the significance of allowing our children the freedom to explore their identities, unencumbered by our own fears and limitations.\n\nAs I continue to reflect on this experience, I am reminded of the power of love and loyalty in shaping our journeys. My daughter's unwavering support and commitment to my well-being, while initially a source of concern, became a catalyst for deeper introspection and growth. Her journey towards independence and self-discovery became intertwined with my own, leading to a mutual understanding and acceptance of our individual paths.\n\nIn conclusion, this case serves as a poignant reminder of the intricate connections between personal growth and familial dynamics. It underscores the importance of empathy, communication, and liberation in fostering healthy relationships and promoting individual well-being. As a clinician and a mother, I am grateful for the opportunity to witness and participate in this transformative journey, knowing that the insights gained will continue to inform my practice and my role within my family.", "causes": "Early upbringing, past life events", "symptoms": "Daughters severely ostracize men", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection;\nPsychodynamics: Exploring the underlying causes behind current behavioral problems;\nFamily Systems Therapy.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Influenced by parental communication patterns and family\ndivision of labor", "treatment_effect": "Help the client to recognize that one of the reasons behind her daughter's problematic behavior is her own relationship and\ncommunication pattern with her husband, and guide her to adopt appropriate ways to communicate with her husband to create a    harmonious and healthy family atmosphere and environment."}

This case encapsulates the broader challenges faced by students as they transition into new environments, revealing the often-overlooked emotional turmoil beneath the surface of academic life. Traditional educational models have long emphasized moral development and behavioral discipline, yet they frequently miss the mark when addressing the emotional and psychological needs of students. This oversight can lead to a disconnection between students' outward compliance and their internal disengagement, as seen in Yang Yan's initial struggle with the group seating change.\n\nAs educators and mental health professionals, we must recognize the evolving psychological landscape of adolescents today. The shift from a collectivist approach to one that acknowledges individuality and personal feelings is crucial. This case illustrates how traditional methods, which prioritize rules and self-sacrifice, can inadvertently suppress the emotional well-being of students. With Yang Yan, the administrative rigidity of seating arrangements, designed for efficiency and discipline, inadvertently triggered a profound sense of isolation and inadequacy. Her story is not unique but rather a reflection of a systemic issue within educational environments.\n\nIn the face of this challenge, metacognitive intervention techniques offer a promising alternative. These techniques focus on enhancing self-awareness and self-regulation, empowering students to understand and manage their emotional responses. By addressing the root causes of Yang Yan's anxiety, we were able to help her reframe her negative perceptions and reduce her stress levels. This approach is rooted in the belief that students possess the inherent capacity to overcome their psychological barriers, provided they are given the right tools and support.\n\nThe consultation process with Yang Yan was a testament to the power of empathy and active listening. Her initial reluctance and feelings of helplessness gradually transformed as we engaged in metacognitive exercises. By helping her identify the sources of her anxiety and teaching her relaxation techniques, we facilitated a shift in her emotional state. The use of landscape imagery and emotional organizers played a crucial role in this transformation, providing a safe space for Yang Yan to explore her feelings and develop new coping mechanisms.\n\nThis case also underscores the importance of continuous follow-up and support. The journey to emotional resilience is not a linear one, and setbacks are an inevitable part of the process. By maintaining regular check-ins with Yang Yan, we were able to reinforce the positive changes and address any emerging challenges. Her subsequent inquiry about metacognitive strategies for academic improvement further demonstrated her growing confidence and self-efficacy.\n\nThrough this experience, I have gained a deeper appreciation for the nuanced interplay between educational structures and student well-being. It is imperative that we adopt a more holistic approach to education, one that balances academic rigor with emotional support. The integration of metacognitive techniques into the educational framework can bridge the gap between traditional discipline and the contemporary need for individual expression and mental health care.\n\nMoreover, this case has highlighted the critical role of educators as facilitators of psychological growth. By fostering a supportive and open environment, we can encourage students to voice their concerns and seek help when needed. This proactive approach can prevent the escalation of adjustment issues and promote a culture of empathy and understanding within schools.\n\nIn conclusion, Yang Yan's case serves as a valuable reminder of the complex challenges faced by adolescents in today's educational settings. It calls for a reevaluation of traditional educational paradigms and the adoption of innovative psychological interventions that prioritize the mental health and emotional development of students. As we continue to navigate the changing landscape of education, it is our responsibility to ensure that students like Yang Yan are equipped not only with academic knowledge but also with the emotional resilience needed to thrive in an ever-evolving world.", "causes": "Social factors (exams, relationships)", "symptoms": "Depressed mood and difficulty concentrating", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection;\nMetacognitive intervention techniques: analyze the root     cause of current problems and explore strategies for learning;\nRelaxation training.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Anxiety reactions caused by high school academic stress are in relationships", "treatment_effect": "It enhances self-awareness and emotional regulation, helps clients to be aware of the real root causes of their problems and troubles, and alleviates the client's rejection of new group members through\nrelaxation training."}

Additionally, Li Moumou has poor self-control and weak verbal communication skills, not engaging with other students. Concerned about the possibility of extreme behavior following disciplinary issues, the team has scheduled psychological counseling for him. First impression: The visitor has a decent appearance, is neatly dressed in a cotton jacket, has slightly long hair, and has a one-inch bald patch on the lower left side of the parietal lobe. He appears mentally exhausted and speaks very softly."], "consultation_process": ["(1) The visitor lived with his parents since childhood. As the only boy in the family, he was spoiled by his parents and was almost completely compliant with their wishes. He dropped out of school in the second year of junior high and began to wander in society. At the age of 15, out of curiosity, he got involved with drugs through acquaintances. To fund his drug habit, he engaged in fights and troublemaking with some \"bad friends.\" At the age of 18 (before he turned 18), he was sentenced to two years of juvenile detention for drug trafficking (mainly to support his own addiction). In 2009, he attempted to quit drugs and asked his father to take him back to his hometown, but he was unsuccessful in overcoming his addiction. In April 2013, he was arrested for drug use and was ordered to undergo compulsory isolation for drug rehabilitation. (2) After reaching adulthood, the visitor’s romantic relationships were hindered. After dropping out of school, he wandered around society and encountered a few girls he liked, but due to his lack of survival skills and his criminal record, the girls were unwilling to accept him, let alone consider marriage. The visitor felt he was a failure. (3) Regarding his interpersonal relationships, the visitor's parents loved him very much, even though he repeatedly made mistakes and broke the law. However, besides his parents, other relatives like uncles and aunts were unwilling to engage with him, and people around him were almost unwilling to associate with him, which made him feel very depressed. He wanted to live a normal life but found it very difficult. He regretted not managing his life well. (4) The biggest issue he currently faces is his inability to get along with those around him. He often clashes with other rehabilitation participants and does not know how to interact with others or how to gain acceptance from his relatives. Treatment settings: (1) The consultation takes place in the psychological correction center's consulting room. (2) Fees: None. (3) Total sessions: 4. (4) Duration of each consultation/treatment: About 50 minutes; once a week. \n\nVI. Treatment process: (1) First consultation: Gathering information, establishing a relationship, and setting consultation goals. Although the visitor was passively seeking consultation, he was self-aware and able to cooperate with the therapist, making the relationship establishment relatively smooth. Based on the interview and test results, it was basically determined that the visitor's issues stemmed from interpersonal relationship problems leading to general psychological issues. After discussing with the visitor, the consultation goal was set to adjust interpersonal relationships, improve depressive states, and help the visitor quickly adapt to the environment of the rehabilitation center. The counseling method used: cognitive-behavioral therapy. (2) Second consultation: Explaining cognitive-behavioral therapy and beginning work with the visitor… Therapist: It seems that recent events have made you feel quite uncomfortable? Visitor: Yes. Therapist: Can you tell me about your feelings? Visitor: … Therapist: You don't need to worry; I am a professional psychological counselor. This role has its professional ethics and integrity, and I will keep your secrets, meaning our conversation is just between you and me; I will not disclose it to others. If you are unwilling to speak, I may not be able to help you. Visitor: Oh. Therapist: (silence) Visitor: How should I put it? Therapist: Hmm. Visitor: I feel very confused; I don't want to live this way. Therapist: Can I understand that you are very dissatisfied with your current state? Visitor: Yes. I cannot adapt to the environment here, and I don't want to adapt, but there is no way out. Therapist: I can understand how you feel. Compulsory isolation for drug rehabilitation is a punishment for drug-related illegal behavior, and any punishment will not feel comfortable. What matters is how you view this situation. In other words, everyone’s emotions are supported by a belief behind them; different interpretations of situations or events will produce different emotions. Visitor: Oh. Therapist: Let's try to see what belief supports your unwillingness to adapt to the rehabilitation center's environment. Visitor: Hmm. I think the people here are not good people. Therapist: Oh. What kind of people do you think are good people? Visitor: Good people should be happy people, those who do not use drugs and are normal. Therapist: And what about you? Visitor: I’m not a good person either, but I don't want to mix with them (the other rehabilitation participants); my thoughts are different from theirs. Therapist: In what ways do you feel this difference? Visitor: I want to be a normal person. I spend every day in distress, and I don't want to live like this. Therapist: You just said, \"Good people should be happy people, those who are normal and do not use drugs.\" Do you think so-called normal people have no worries? Visitor: At least they are not like me; apart from my parents, no one cares about me. Therapist: They do not use drugs and do not have worries arising from drug use. But that does not mean they have no other worries; no one lives in a vacuum. Visitor: (embarrassed smile) What you said is also true. Therapist: So, think about it, what kind of belief lies behind your worries? Visitor: Maybe it’s \"drug users are not good people, and no one likes drug users.\" Therapist: Yes, it is this belief that causes you distress and unwillingness to interact with those around you, even leading to constant conflicts with them, right? Visitor: Probably. Therapist: If we modify or adjust this belief, let’s think about what effects it might have; let’s give it a try. Visitor: You mean… Therapist: \"Drug users are not good people, and no one likes drug users.\" Let’s rephrase that. For example, \"Drug users are simply people with drug dependence, but it does not mean that all drug users are worthless.\" Give it a try. Visitor: Hmm. Drug users are not people without any merits; not everyone hates drug users; for example, family members have not completely given up on us. Therapist: When you think this way, how do you feel about the other rehabilitation participants around you? Visitor: Thinking this way, I don’t seem to dislike them very much anymore; it feels like I’m not so disliked either. Therapist: Hmm. This is what I want to tell you today; we are going to use cognitive-behavioral therapy to address your issues. This therapy is based on cognitive patterns. The model assumes that a person's emotions, behaviors, and physiological responses are influenced by their interpretations and evaluations of events; for example, after your interpretation changed just now, your emotions also changed, right? Visitor: Oh. Therapist: Also, the situation itself does not determine people's feelings; feelings depend more on how people interpret the situation. There is an automatic thought about situations that enters your mind quickly, briefly, and subtly, and your brain believes it to be real. So this is what people usually say: people are self-righteous. Visitor: So, in the rehabilitation center, not everyone thinks like me, believing that everyone else is not a good person, which leads to negative emotions? Therapist: Yes, you could say that. When other people do not have such beliefs, they will not experience such worries either. Visitor: Oh. Therapist: After this consultation, I will assign you some homework each time, which is a form you can try to fill out, and it can help you recognize your emotions. How do you feel about that? Visitor: Oh, let’s give it a try. … The visitor was introduced to a three-column form and guided to try filling it out. \n\nThird consultation: Discussing the visitor's homework from the past week. To help him better understand the irrationality of his automatic thoughts, the therapist used storytelling. Based on the visitor's aggressive personality, the therapist chose the story of \"Zhou Chu Slays the Serpent.\" Coincidentally, the visitor did not know this story, so the therapist set up scenarios each time for the visitor to imagine himself as Zhou Chu and what he would do. When the visitor heard that the common people compared Zhou Chu to the three pests, a tiger on the mountain and a serpent in the water, and said that if it were him, he would definitely not spare those who spoke ill of him, the therapist told the visitor about Zhou Chu's reformation. The visitor saw the deviation in his way of thinking through the differences, which triggered reflection. … Therapist: You completed your homework last week very carefully; it seems you take it seriously, and I also appreciate your trust in me. Visitor: (embarrassed smile) Yes, I know you are helping me. Therapist: Let’s talk about what feelings you had while doing your homework, okay? Visitor: Sure. Actually, when you said to do homework last time, I was really very troubled and unwilling. I wasn’t a diligent student back in school; I dropped out before finishing junior high, and I don’t really like writing and drawing things. But thinking about it, I promised you, and if I don’t do it, you would definitely be disappointed. Therapist: (smiling) Yes, you still persevered, even though you were initially reluctant. Visitor: Yes. Therapist: What did you feel while doing your homework? Visitor: I tried to follow your method and record some uncomfortable events and situations I encountered in my real life. Strangely, when I wrote these things down and identified my automatic thoughts, I felt embarrassed, thinking, \"Why am I like this?\" But I still felt a bit relieved. Therapist: Hmm. The three-column form is a great way to sort out your emotions, and it also allows you to see your thinking patterns in certain events and situations, helping us understand what exactly leads to your emotions. Visitor: Oh. Therapist: Today, we discussed your homework, and we also have a five-column form, which adds two columns to your three-column form. We will look for reasonable alternative thoughts for your automatic thoughts and see how our emotions might change. … The therapist guided the visitor to try the exercise and assigned homework for the third consultation. \n\nFourth consultation: Consolidating the consultation effects. Given that the visitor has a low level of education and lacks knowledge about drugs, during the fourth consultation, the therapist took the visitor to visit the drug prohibition and rehabilitation exhibition room in the center. The exhibition provided information on drug knowledge, laws and regulations regarding drug prohibition and rehabilitation, and successful rehabilitation cases to reinforce the visitor's understanding. On one hand, it helped him develop a scientific and reasonable understanding of compulsory drug rehabilitation, accept and face reality, and quickly adapt to the environment. On the other hand, it helped him build confidence through successful rehabilitation cases. The therapist discussed the homework assigned after the third consultation with the visitor, helping him see the emotional changes following the shift in his beliefs and master skills to improve cognition. After the consultation ended, follow-up visits indicated that the visitor adapted quickly, his relationships with other participants improved significantly, and he actively participated in labor at the construction site."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on Li Moumou’s case offers a profound opportunity to delve into the complexities of human behavior and the intricate interplay between past experiences, cognitive distortions, and the potential for change. In Li Moumou, we see an individual whose formative years were marked by a lack of nurturing family and educational environments, which critically influenced the development of his self-concept and interpersonal dynamics. His underdeveloped superego and poor self-regulation are symptomatic of the emotional impoverishment and fragmented sense of self that stemmed from these early life deficits.\n\nThroughout our sessions, it became evident that Li Moumou's personality was shaped by a series of maladaptive beliefs and cognitive distortions. These distorted beliefs, such as \"I am not liked,\" \"Everyone hates me,\" and \"My life is over,\" were not just abstract thoughts but deeply ingrained narratives that governed his interactions and self-perception. The lack of a supportive and corrective emotional experience during his formative years likely contributed to these cognitive patterns. His combative and paranoid nature can be seen as both a defense mechanism and a manifestation of these distortions, wherein he preemptively strikes out to protect himself from perceived threats of rejection and judgment.\n\nLi Moumou's engagement with negative peer groups and his involvement in illicit activities further entrenched these cognitive distortions. The social isolation he experienced as a consequence of his behavior reinforced his belief that he was unlikable and incapable of redemption. This isolation served as a self-fulfilling prophecy, where his expectations of rejection led to behaviors that perpetuated his estrangement from others.\n\nDespite the bleakness of his early experiences and the challenges he faced, Li Moumou demonstrated a remarkable capacity for insight and a desire for change. This intrinsic motivation was a crucial factor in the success we achieved during our sessions. His ability to introspect and his openness to therapeutic interventions allowed us to challenge and begin to modify his maladaptive beliefs. It is a testament to the human spirit's resilience that even in the face of significant adversity, individuals like Li Moumou can aspire to and achieve transformation.\n\nThe use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) was particularly effective in this context, as it provided a structured framework for Li Moumou to examine and reframe his thoughts. The process of identifying automatic thoughts and exploring alternative interpretations enabled him to perceive his environment and interactions through a more balanced lens. For instance, by reinterpreting his belief about drug users and his own identity, he was able to diminish the stigma he felt and start to see himself as someone with potential rather than someone doomed by his past.\n\nThe therapeutic journey also highlighted the importance of narrative in shaping one's identity. Through storytelling, such as the tale of \"Zhou Chu Slays the Serpent,\" Li Moumou was able to externalize and critically evaluate his own life story. This approach helped him to recognize the possibility of redemption and personal growth, much like the character in the story. By reframing his narrative, he began to see his past not as a series of insurmountable failures but as a foundation for learning and change.\n\nOne of the significant challenges in this case was addressing Li Moumou's social skills and his ability to form meaningful relationships. His longing for intimate connections was palpable, yet his limited experience with healthy relationships meant he lacked the necessary skills to establish and maintain them. This gap was a source of great distress for him, particularly as he entered the age where social and romantic relationships typically become more central to one's life. Our sessions aimed to equip him with the tools to navigate these social landscapes, focusing on communication skills, empathy, and the ability to understand and manage emotions in interpersonal contexts.\n\nFurthermore, Li Moumou's case underscores the critical role of timing in therapeutic interventions. His readiness to engage with therapy coincided with a period of personal crisis and a strong desire for change, which provided a fertile ground for therapeutic work. This readiness was a pivotal element in the progress we made, as it meant that he was not only willing to participate in therapy but also motivated to apply the insights and skills acquired in our sessions to his daily life.\n\nNevertheless, while the therapy sessions facilitated significant progress in Li Moumou's emotional regulation and cognitive restructuring, it is clear that the journey toward full self-integration and mastery of life skills requires continued effort beyond the confines of our sessions. The therapeutic process laid the groundwork for ongoing personal development, but Li Moumou will need to remain committed to this path, seeking further support and opportunities for growth as he encounters new challenges.\n\nLooking ahead, it is vital for Li Moumou to continue developing a robust support network, which can provide the encouragement and accountability needed to sustain his progress. Engaging with community resources, participating in support groups, and seeking out positive role models could all serve as valuable supplements to the therapeutic work we have done. Additionally, continued education and skill development will be crucial in enhancing his self-efficacy and expanding his future prospects, both personally and professionally.\n\nIn conclusion, Li Moumou's case is a profound reminder of the transformative power of therapy and the potential for human growth. Despite a challenging past, his journey illustrates that change is possible when there is a convergence of personal motivation, therapeutic support, and the willingness to confront and reframe one's narrative. As clinicians, it is our role to provide the tools and guidance necessary to navigate this process, while recognizing the inherent resilience and capacity for change within each individual.", "causes": "Early upbringing environment (doting) and social factors (interpersonal and intimate relationships)", "symptoms": "Distress caused by social maladjustment and disharmony\nin interpersonal relationships", "treatment_process": "Gather basic information, build relationships, and set goals;\nCognitive-behavioral therapy: challenging the client's irrational beliefs;\nStory Therapy: Use the story of \"Zhou Chu Killing the Snake\" to make them aware of the differences between\ndifferent individual thinking and the different outcomes that may result;\nVisit a drug rehabilitation center: increase drug awareness and introduce successful cases to reinforce counselling.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Have drug abuse experience and have maladjusted in a\ndrug rehabilitation center", "treatment_effect": "Aware of the negative emotions and aggression caused by their    unreasonable beliefs, they alleviated the negative emotions, improved their emotional regulation ability, and welcomed the future life with\nhope and courage."}

After starting university, he is determined to study hard and find a good job in the future. He always thought that being so excellent in elementary and high school should translate to outstanding performance in such a good learning environment, but contrary to his expectations, he ranked in the bottom third of his major in the midterm exam a month ago. Seeing that his classmates not only have good grades but are also versatile, many have found their suitable positions in student councils and clubs, he feels that he has no special talents. The academic achievements he once took pride in have lost their advantage in this talent-rich university. This makes him feel useless and inferior, and he feels guilty thinking about his parents working hard on the farm to support his university education. He is reluctant to interact with classmates, feels lonely and isolated, loses confidence, and suffers greatly. Since last month, he has experienced symptoms such as headaches, chest tightness, palpitations, and insomnia, along with feelings of tension, inability to concentrate, and increasing anxiety about his studies. The more he worries about his studies, the more anxious and uneasy he becomes, resulting in poor study efficiency. He is troubled but does not want to just give up, so he seeks psychological counseling. The counselor noted that the helper was clean and tidy in appearance, spoke nervously, but was able to actively discuss his discomfort. He has strong self-control and a strong desire for treatment.

This case with Ma, a first-year university student, has underscored the intricate interplay between self-perception, environmental changes, and cognitive-emotional processes. The pivotal focus was Ma's struggle with adapting to a talent-rich university setting, which led to a cascade of cognitive and emotional challenges. Initially, Ma exhibited symptoms characteristic of adjustment disorder, manifesting through somatic complaints, anxiety, and a profound sense of inferiority. These symptoms were exacerbated by his previously unchallenged academic excellence and the subsequent dissonance with the new academic environment where his achievements lost their distinguishing value.\n\nAt the core of Ma's distress were several irrational beliefs, rooted deeply in his cognitive framework. The belief that he must excel in all domains and the fear of disappointing his parents contributed significantly to his anxiety. Rational Emotive Therapy (RET) served as a crucial modality to address these cognitive distortions. RET's structured approach facilitated Ma's understanding of the ABC model, where Activating events (A) lead to Beliefs (B), which then result in emotional Consequences (C). This cognitive restructuring process was instrumental in helping Ma identify and challenge his irrational beliefs, such as the necessity of constant approval and the notion that failure equates to worthlessness.\n\nThroughout the consultations, Ma gradually recognized the maladaptive nature of his beliefs and began to reconstruct them. This transformation was not immediate; it required a systematic and empathetic approach to guide him through self-exploration and self-acceptance. The development of rational beliefs provided Ma with a more balanced view of his capabilities and limitations. This adjustment was reflected in his improved ability to face setbacks without succumbing to anxiety or self-deprecation.\n\nA significant aspect of this case was the role of social support systems in mitigating adjustment disorders. Initially, Ma's lack of a supportive peer network contributed to his feelings of isolation and anxiety. Encouraging him to engage more actively with his classmates and participate in extracurricular activities was part of the therapeutic strategy. As Ma became more involved in social interactions, he reported feeling less isolated and more integrated into the university community. This social engagement not only enhanced his interpersonal skills but also provided a buffer against stressors, reinforcing the importance of social support in psychological adjustment.\n\nThe iterative nature of the therapeutic process required continuous evaluation and adaptation. The progress Ma made was monitored through regular assessments using tools like the SCL-90 and the SAS. These assessments were crucial in quantifying his psychological improvement and provided tangible feedback that reinforced his efforts and progress. The reduction in scores indicated a significant alleviation of symptoms, validating the effectiveness of the therapeutic interventions.\n\nReflecting on this case, it becomes evident that adjustment disorders are multifaceted and require a holistic approach. It is not merely about addressing the symptoms but understanding the underlying cognitive and emotional patterns that contribute to the disorder. In Ma's case, his strong self-control and willingness to engage in therapy were vital to his recovery. These personal attributes, combined with a structured therapeutic approach, facilitated a successful outcome.\n\nThe transformation in Ma's demeanor and outlook was remarkable. Initially reserved and isolated, he evolved into a more confident and socially active individual. His proactive participation in class activities and his initiative in organizing events were testament to his newfound self-assurance and adaptability. This change highlighted the potential for significant personal growth and development through targeted psychological interventions.\n\nIn retrospect, this case has reinforced the importance of early intervention and the role of therapeutic relationships in fostering change. Establishing a trusting and supportive therapeutic relationship was crucial in enabling Ma to express his vulnerabilities and work through them. The non-judgmental and empathetic environment provided a safe space for Ma to explore his thoughts and feelings, facilitating his journey towards self-discovery and self-improvement.\n\nUltimately, Ma's case serves as a poignant reminder of the resilience inherent in individuals and the transformative power of psychotherapy. It underscores the necessity of addressing both cognitive distortions and emotional distress to achieve comprehensive psychological well-being. This experience has enriched my understanding of adjustment disorders and reinforced the efficacy of Rational Emotive Therapy in addressing cognitive-emotional challenges, offering valuable insights for future therapeutic endeavors.", "causes": "Social factors (changes in school and environment, lack of social support)", "symptoms": "Academic maladjustment, anxiety, somatization", "treatment_process": "Gather basic information and build relationships;\nPsychological assessment and development of counseling goals and plans;\nRational Emotion Therapy: Challenges the client's irrational beliefs, such as failure equals worthlessness and the ultimate    pursuit of recognition;\nConsolidation and outlook.", "characteristics_of_illness": "ubiquitous", "treatment_effect": "Becoming more confident and active has improved the ability to adapt and adjust in future life and study."}
{"id": 40, "case_description": ["Visitor, female, 31 years old this year, married for 12 years, with an 8-year-old son. Currently the manager of a national food chain store. Her husband is a pastry chef at the same store. Came for consultation due to a marital crisis."], "consultation_process": ["Consultation time: August 14, 2018, location: online voice consultation.", "3. Consultation Objective: I am experiencing a marital crisis due to emotional infidelity. How can I save my marriage and family?", "IV. Consultation Process: The client is an adopted child, with two older brothers in her adoptive family. She says her adoptive mother did not like her since childhood, and her adoptive father and two brothers have bad tempers. The dislike from her adoptive mother made the client mature too early; she became cautious in speaking and acting, and developed a habit of lying because telling the truth would lead to being beaten or scolded! As a result, she was a problematic student in school, and her parents often said they wouldn't let her go to school. Every time it was time to pay tuition, she would cry and make a fuss for several days! After dropping out of junior high, her adoptive father arranged for her to study medicine, but later the teachers from the vocational school reported her to her family. Eventually, her father stopped supporting her education. After dropping out, she sold flowers in Beijing and worked in Guangdong. During her working days, she met her current husband. They have been together for 12 years now. Over the years, she has devoted herself entirely to her husband without complaint. Her inner fears have never disappeared; when her husband raises his voice, she cries loudly out of fear. During their courtship, they often argued, and she even attempted suicide by taking pills but was rescued later. Her husband is introverted and honest; he was once recognized as a bad boy, and she claims to have changed him! (How did she change him—did he become better or worse?) The reason she met with an online acquaintance is that although her adoptive mother acknowledges her, she has never treated her well. Throughout their marriage, neither her adoptive mother nor biological mother has visited her in Xi'an, making her feel quite lonely. In March of this year, she met a married man online; he spoke flirtatiously, cared for her, and made her feel dependent on him, giving her a feeling of romance she had never experienced before! Once, the client was taken to his home, and they had dinner together. She described some affectionate contact, but there was no sexual activity; she just left two lip prints on his chest. Later, her husband discovered the WeChat chat records and suggestive pictures, and he was very angry, even proposing divorce. The client is extremely afraid of divorce and terrified that her husband would leave her (subconsciously fearing abandonment, she tries hard to please him and takes all the blame upon herself). Recently, her husband has stopped mentioning divorce, but he sighs every day and doesn't pay much attention to her! He has been irritable and unable to eat. Whenever she sees him like this, the client believes he is still angry with her; it’s all her fault, she has harmed him, and she is the one who is not good enough! She is very afraid of divorce. (The client's friend said, it’s not that your husband won’t let you go; it’s that you won’t let yourself go! You are condemning yourself deep down, feeling guilty and self-blaming!) Her friend pointed out that she always likes to give to others, easily compromises in doing things, lacks a sense of self, and is someone who consistently compromises.", "5. Personal Analysis: The visitor detailed her experience of being adopted since childhood and explained that her \"lying\" is related to the interaction patterns with her adoptive parents. She may have realized how this upbringing has influenced her and its connection to her current difficulties. What if we challenge the visitor's tendency to attribute problems to internal factors and her thoughts of self-blame and guilt?"], "experience_and_reflection": "The process of engaging with this client has been a complex journey, revealing the intricate layers of her personal history and current relational dynamics. As I reflect on the experience and effectiveness of our consultations, several insights emerge, not only concerning the client's personal struggles but also regarding the therapeutic process itself.\n\nInitially, our primary consultation goal was to address the crisis in her marriage, focusing on the immediate issue of emotional infidelity. However, it quickly became apparent that the roots of the marital discord were deeply entwined with the client's longstanding psychological issues—issues that traced back to her childhood experiences as an adopted child in a less-than-nurturing family environment. Her history of feeling unwanted and unloved by her adoptive family has fostered a pervasive fear of abandonment, which continues to play a significant role in her adult relationships. This fear manifests as a need to please others, often at her own expense, and a pattern of self-blame and guilt that keeps her trapped in a cycle of emotional turmoil.\n\nThe client's interpersonal communication style, characterized by a tendency to \"always give\" and compromise, seems to stem from an internalized belief that her value is contingent upon her ability to meet others' needs. This people-pleaser mentality, while perhaps adaptive in her youth, is now maladaptive in her adult life, particularly in her marriage. It contributes to her perception that she is responsible for her husband's emotions and wellbeing, leading her to bear the burden of blame for the marital crisis. This self-imposed responsibility is compounded by her husband's apparent emotional withdrawal and irritability, which she interprets as ongoing anger and disappointment directed toward her.\n\nDuring our sessions, I attempted to explore these deep-seated beliefs and their impact on her current situation. However, I encountered resistance when delving into her communication patterns and the underlying motivations for her behaviors. This resistance might indicate a protective mechanism, where acknowledging these patterns feels threatening because it challenges her current identity and coping strategies. It raises a critical question about the nature of therapeutic engagement: how do we navigate resistance while respecting the client's pace and readiness for change?\n\nThe logistical aspects of the consultation also played a role in its effectiveness. The online nature of our sessions, while convenient, introduced distractions and interruptions that impeded the depth of our interactions. The incident where a staff member interrupted our session highlights a broader issue with the online setting: the necessity of ensuring a distraction-free environment. This situation underscores the importance of establishing clear boundaries and expectations for the setting, similar to how we approach interpersonal boundaries within the therapeutic relationship.\n\nReflecting on the relational dynamics within the client's marriage, it is evident that both partners are experiencing psychological distress. The client frequently expresses a desire to understand her husband's thoughts and feelings, particularly in light of his recent sexual advances. These advances may suggest a complicated mix of emotions on his part, potentially indicating attempts at reconciliation or expressions of unresolved feelings. This uncertainty presents an opportunity for opening dialogue within the marriage, potentially through structured marriage counseling where both partners can express their needs and emotions in a safe environment.\n\nA significant takeaway from this case is the client's pattern of clinging—to her mistakes, her marriage, and even the therapeutic process. Her fear of abandonment and subsequent self-blame create a scenario where she remains tethered to her sense of inadequacy and guilt. This pattern reflects a broader issue of unclear interpersonal boundaries, not just with her husband, but also with herself and others, including within our therapeutic relationship. It brings to light the importance of helping clients understand and establish healthy boundaries, both within their relationships and within the context of therapy.\n\nAs the clinician, I recognize the need to balance empathy with firmness in maintaining these boundaries. This balance is crucial to avoid enmeshment and to promote the client's autonomy and growth. The reflections on boundaries extend beyond this particular case, prompting considerations about the ethical and practical implications of maintaining professional boundaries while fostering a supportive therapeutic environment.\n\nIn considering the client's request for ongoing contact beyond the structured sessions, it became imperative to reinforce the boundaries of our professional relationship. This reinforcement serves not only as a model for her other relationships but also safeguards the integrity of the therapeutic process. It reminds us that while therapy is a unique relationship, it remains distinct and separate from personal relationships.\n\nThe concept of boundaries also relates to the client's experience of extramarital interactions. Her involvement with an online acquaintance, although not physically consummated, signifies a search for emotional fulfillment outside her marriage. This search is emblematic of unmet emotional and possibly sexual needs within the marriage. It raises questions about her understanding of fidelity and the role of emotional intimacy in her relationship. Addressing these issues requires careful navigation, ensuring that the client feels supported while exploring the underlying needs and motivations for her actions.\n\nThe client's friend astutely pointed out that the issue is not solely about others not letting her go, but rather her inability to let herself go. This insight aligns with the therapeutic goal of fostering self-compassion and encouraging the client to release the guilt and self-blame that she carries. The homework I assigned, focusing on self-affirmation and appreciation, was a step toward this goal. However, the effectiveness of such interventions depends on the client's willingness and capacity to internalize these positive affirmations, which can be a gradual process.\n\nUltimately, this case has highlighted the complexity of addressing marital crises that are intertwined with deep-seated personal issues. It underscores the importance of a holistic approach that considers both individual and relational factors. As we continue to work through these challenges, it remains critical to adapt our strategies to the client's evolving needs, maintaining a focus on empowerment and self-discovery.\n\nIn conclusion, this reflection has reinforced the significance of clear therapeutic goals, the necessity of establishing and maintaining boundaries, and the importance of addressing both individual and relational dynamics in therapy. As we move forward, these insights will guide the ongoing work with this client, helping her to navigate her fears, strengthen her sense of self, and ultimately, empower her to let go of the guilt and embrace her inherent worth.", "causes": "Early upbringing, upbringing, and social factors (extramarital relationships)", "symptoms": "Distress caused by social maladjustment and disharmony\nin interpersonal relationships", "treatment_process": "Gather basic information, build relationships, and set goals; Psychoanalysis and Narrative Therapy: Exploring the\nMotivations Behind Behavioral Problems and New Perspectives on Problems;\nPositive autosuggestion.", "characteristics_of_illness": "The insecurity caused by the experience of childhood\nadoption leads to a sense of unclear boundaries", "treatment_effect": "Help clients overcome fears, reduce feelings of guilt, understand and accept themselves, increase their sense of self and self-worth,    and strengthen their sense of boundaries with others later in life."}

I would like to consult you about some issues related to studying and socializing. Consultant: Can you please share your situation? Seeker: Let me start with my studies. Our second semester of the second year is almost over, and we are now in the phase of practicing a large number of problems. I feel that my math scores have been fluctuating a lot recently. The full score for the math exam is 150 points, and I usually score above 130 if I am stable. However, I have had several recent math tests where I did poorly, with my worst score being around 90. I feel that it's due to my carelessness, but I can't improve it. Consultant: Oh, can you give a specific example? Seeker: For example, when I was doing a fill-in-the-blank question, it seemed like I should know how to do it, but after 10 minutes I couldn't find the answer, so I gave up and started working on the larger problems. While doing those, I went back and spent another 5 minutes finishing the fill-in-the-blank question, but in the end, I still filled in the answer incorrectly for no apparent reason. Now, at least two or three questions on a math test are like this. Consultant: Hmm, how long would you normally spend on a fill-in-the-blank question? Seeker: 1-2 minutes. Consultant: It seems you are spending too much time on it, and due to not being familiar with the question, you are also prone to making mistakes. Seeker: Yes. Consultant: I once discussed math study methods with a friend and would like to share them with you. He said that when he takes a math test, he first assesses the questions on the paper, distinguishing between those he can answer immediately and those that require some time to think about. After browsing through, he starts answering the questions, so he feels more confident. He finishes all the questions he can do first, then tackles the difficult ones one by one. This is about managing time. For the questions he got wrong, he goes through the problem again, calculates the time it took, and if it took 10 minutes, he tries to do it again three days later, estimating it will take him about 5 minutes. Then, when he tries it again two weeks later, it should take 1-2 minutes. He also marks the knowledge points he encountered with a \"tick\" and reviews those with the most ticks right before the exam. Seeker: Hmm, I feel like I understand the knowledge points for this question, but I'm just spending too much time on it and not being very familiar. It seems I can try this. Our school also has a question bank system, which helps find similar questions for practice based on the ones you got wrong. When I was in middle school, I went at my own pace, and it was very relaxed and comfortable. During my entrance exam, I ranked 32nd in science and 7th in liberal arts, which is considered the highest score for someone in liberal arts taking science. Now I usually stay within the top three in my class, but I'm worried that if I continue at my own pace, my ranking will drop, and the teachers and classmates will have a negative opinion of me. The teachers assign a large volume of practice questions every day, and since my homeroom teacher is the math teacher, if my grades drop, he will talk to me. Consultant: My neighbor often shares stories about his child with me. His child, named Bin (a pseudonym), is in an elite class at school. Of course, he isn't as excellent as you, but he seems to have had similar experiences. Seeker: Oh, what is it like? Is he a boy? Consultant: Yes. Seeker: Please tell me. Consultant: This is a story called the \"Silent Period.\" Recently, Bin's physics scores have been improving, reaching the top 90 in his grade, which is quite impressive since he wasn't doing well in physics before. His father was curious about how he achieved this and asked him. Bin said that after deriving the basic concepts he wasn't familiar with, he practiced many types of problems based on those concepts. During that time, he didn't follow the teacher's pace, and his grades did drop. However, after 3-4 months, with enough practice, he felt that there were no obstacles to his scores. Those 3-4 months were his \"Silent Period,\" where he didn't care about the teacher's opinions and followed his own pace. Consultant: How do you feel after hearing this story? Seeker: I feel it should be effective. I'm hesitating about whether to try it, but I'm worried that my grades will drop and the teachers and classmates won't think highly of me. Consultant: What is your normal score? What score fluctuation would you consider acceptable? Seeker: My normal score is around 135. If I score below 120, the teacher will increase the volume of practice questions for us. Consultant: Your grades are good, but I don't think you're really that impressive. In your next exam, try to intentionally get 5 fill-in-the-blank or multiple-choice questions wrong, with each worth less than 10 points. If you can do that, then you would be truly impressive. Seeker: Why? Consultant: It's like driving on the highway. Do you think a car that maintains a constant speed of 120 is more impressive, or a car that drifts or changes lanes quickly? Seeker: This experiment is interesting. I don't know how they would perceive it, but I can try it. Consultant: After the exam, see if the teachers and classmates' opinions of you change, and let me know how you feel afterwards. Seeker: Okay. Seeker: Teacher, I have another question about interpersonal relationships. I feel like I can't find good friends in this class. My deskmate is very stubborn; she says she wants to ask me questions but doesn't listen to my solutions and insists on her own views. Sometimes we even argue. Actually, I had a good friend in middle school. We talked about everything, and she had a lot of ideas. She was cheerful, dared to do her own things, and often supported me. However, she is now in the adjacent class, and we rarely chat. We also live in different towns, so it's difficult to meet on weekends. Consultant: You had a happy time in middle school because you had a good friend to support you, but now she can't sync up with your activities, which is bothering you. Seeker: Yes, I hope to have a close friend in my class, someone with whom I share common topics. Consultant: It seems difficult; your deskmate doesn't seem to support you. Seeker: Not entirely; we do rotate seats based on group performance and dorm behavior, and I have met two or three people I enjoy chatting with. However, they already have very close friends, and I haven't reached that level with them yet. Consultant: It is said that going through \"bad\" experiences together can easily create a bond of brotherhood, although here \"bad\" is in quotes. Seeker: Haha, I know you don't mean real bad things. My middle school classmates and I were like that; we often complained about teachers and didn't follow their study requirements, but we were very happy. Consultant: Have there been any similar happy moments among your high school classmates? Seeker: No, there are many girls in our class, and they are all too well-behaved. Consultant: That's a pity. You have one year left; try to create more of those happy moments. When you go to college and start working, you can invite her to complain about your high school life together. Seeker: That makes sense. I can start trying to get along with those classmates I enjoy chatting with. Consultant: Of course you can."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on this case provides an opportunity to delve deeper into the psychological and emotional experiences of a high-achieving high school student navigating the challenges of academic pressure and social integration. The original insights provided a valuable foundation, but as I revisit the case with a more extensive analysis, several layers of complexity and potential interventions emerge.\n\nFirst and foremost, the importance of metacognition in learning cannot be overstated. Metacognition, or the awareness and understanding of one's own thought processes, plays a crucial role in how students manage their learning and academic performance. By helping the student develop metacognitive skills, we empower them to identify and harness control points within their study habits. The student's struggle with fluctuating math scores, despite a good understanding of the material, suggests a need for improved metacognitive strategies. Encouraging the student to self-monitor and reflect on their problem-solving processes can lead to more effective time management and error correction. For instance, the technique of assessing and categorizing questions before attempting them fosters a proactive approach to exams, reducing anxiety and enhancing focus.\n\nFurthermore, the story of the \"Silent Period\" offers a compelling framework for self-regulation and pacing in learning. The student's fear of falling behind or being negatively perceived by teachers and peers is a common concern among high achievers. However, by embracing a period of self-directed learning, students can focus on deepening their understanding without the immediate pressure of external evaluations. This approach requires courage and a shift in mindset, as it involves temporarily stepping away from the conventional expectations of continuous high performance. The concept of a \"Silent Period\" is analogous to a strategic retreat, where the student can consolidate their knowledge base, experiment with different learning techniques, and ultimately reemerge with a more robust and resilient academic foundation.\n\nThe \"story of driving at high speed\" serves as a metaphor for managing external evaluations and the associated anxiety. The suggestion to intentionally make minor errors in an exam challenges the student's perfectionistic tendencies and sensitivity to judgment. This exercise not only provides insight into how external perceptions may shift but also fosters resilience by reducing the fear of failure. The experience can be liberating, teaching the student that their worth is not solely defined by their grades. It also promotes a healthier relationship with mistakes, viewing them as learning opportunities rather than threats to self-esteem.\n\nIn terms of social integration, the metaphor of \"brothers in adversity\" introduces an interesting dimension to interpersonal relationships. The student's yearning for close friendships and their previous positive experiences with a supportive peer highlight the significance of social bonds in emotional well-being. High school can be an isolating experience, particularly for students who prioritize academic achievement over social connections. The idea of shared adversity, even if trivial or symbolic, can create a sense of camaraderie and belonging. Encouraging the student to engage in shared experiences with classmates, whether through group projects, extracurricular activities, or even light-hearted challenges, can foster a sense of unity and friendship. These shared experiences can serve as a foundation for deeper connections, making the school environment more supportive and enjoyable.\n\nAdditionally, the case touches on the intricate dynamics of parent-child relationships in the context of academic pressure. While not explicitly detailed in the consultation process, it is implicit that parental expectations and family values may influence the student's stress levels and self-perception. Engaging parents in the therapeutic process can be beneficial, providing them with insights into the psychological impact of academic pressure and encouraging a supportive, rather than critical, approach. Open communication between parents and children about academic goals and emotional well-being can alleviate some of the pressure and foster a nurturing environment that prioritizes holistic development over mere academic success.\n\nIncorporating technology, such as the school's question bank system, into the learning process is another avenue worth exploring. Technology can offer personalized learning experiences, allowing students to practice and master specific areas of difficulty at their own pace. Encouraging the student to leverage such resources can provide additional support, complementing traditional study methods and enhancing their overall learning experience.\n\nIn conclusion, this case highlights the multifaceted nature of adolescent development, where academic achievement, social integration, and emotional well-being intersect. By expanding the original insights with a more nuanced analysis, we can offer a comprehensive approach that addresses the student's immediate concerns while also equipping them with skills and strategies for long-term success. The integration of metacognitive techniques, self-regulated learning, resilience building, social connection, and parental involvement creates a holistic framework that not only alleviates current pressures but also prepares the student for future challenges.", "causes": "Personal personality factors (high self-demanding) and social factors (interpersonal sensitivity and lack of support)", "symptoms": "Troubles caused by study pressure and poor interpersonal communication", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection and relationship building;\n\nHumanistic Therapy: Listening, Empathy, Acceptance, Empathy, and Influence;\nMetacognitive strategy techniques: improve self- monitoring and control skills;\nStory metaphor: use the story of \"the speed of the vehicle on the highway\" to alleviate the negative emotions caused by  failure;\nCognitive therapy: Challenging their irrational beliefs.", "characteristics_of_illness": "ubiquitous", "treatment_effect": "It alleviates the bad emotions caused by being too concerned about the evaluation of others, and improves the ability of self-\nregulation and monitoring."}

Her social functioning is normal, she has a high level of awareness, and she is proactive in seeking psychological counseling.", "Today marks the 25th conversation between Lemon and me. Our relationship has become increasingly close, and Lemon has become more proactive in scheduling my time. During the nearly half-year counseling process, we have explored topics such as Lemon's intimate relationship with her husband, her relationships with her parents, friendships, work relationships, emotional distress, irrational belief patterns, hobbies, weight loss, traumatic events, and more. Overall, relationships in various aspects are improving; she is no longer so concerned about others' opinions, her independence and initiative have increased, her level of self-acceptance has improved, her understanding and exploration of herself are gradually increasing, and she has come to terms with traumatic past events, recognizing many limiting and fixed patterns within herself."], "consultation_process": ["In our last consultation, we discussed how the singing voice live streaming occupied almost all of Lemon's spare time, neglecting her companionship with her husband. This week, Lemon chose to end the live streaming, and it was obvious that the couple's time together increased and they became closer. However, she felt particularly upset about giving up the live streaming, always feeling a sense of regret, and her emotions have been restless.", "(The following is part of our conversation content.)", "Me: Clearly unwilling, yet you still gave up. This choice must not have been easy for you, right?", "Lemon: Yes. But I've been live streaming for nearly 100 days, and my popularity hasn't increased at all. I can't even meet the minimum assessment standards on the rankings. Sometimes there are only one or two people in the live stream room, but just those few people make me feel that giving up live streaming would be very irresponsible towards them.", "(Saying this, Lemon silently shed tears.)", "Me: Hmm. I can feel that you really don't want to part with the live stream. I think you must really love singing, right?", "Lemon: Yes. I love singing and following celebrities. Last week, my favorite idol group disbanded, and I was really heartbroken when I saw their final performance. I started following celebrities back in elementary school, and I have always had idols and groups that I admire.", "I: I've always had favorite idols, and I think they must hold a special meaning for you, right?", "Lemon: I can't really explain it, but I feel like the me who likes following celebrities is a different version of myself from another world.", "Me: Hmm. I'm curious about what your world is like in another dimension.", "Lemon: Hmm. That should be a world closer to happiness. I feel very happy and relaxed when I listen to music or sing, and I'm very comfortable chatting and communicating with people, completely without pressure. You know, I usually feel a lot of pressure in social interactions. Although I can force myself to socialize, and even in elementary school, I was often pushed by my dad to participate in speeches or performances, those were not things I did willingly. I have to work very hard to do those things, but when I sing or interact with friends who sing, I don't feel that way.", "I: It seems that I understand a bit now. So when you are singing, you are relaxed and at ease, and it sounds like another you, a glowing you.", "Lemon: Mhm, yes. I'm in the live broadcast room and I don't encourage everyone to give me gifts. I don't even let some students send gifts, but I really want to sing for them.", "I: I think I somewhat understand why you feel so sad about giving up on live streaming. It was your other world, a better world. Would you like to describe more about the singing you?", "Lemon: Yes. Yesterday, a child messaged me asking why I wasn't live streaming. I felt that I was happy, recognized, and needed in that moment.", "Me: Hmm, that's really nice. That is a happy, recognized, and needed you. What name would you give that you?", "Lemon: Let's call it CICI, that's the name in my live streaming room.", "Me: Okay, CICI. So what about the other version of you in life? You can also pick a name. Let's use the Gestalt double chair technique today to let these two different versions of you, or rather these two parts of yourself, have a dialogue and try to meet, shall we?", "Lemon: Okay, teacher. The other one is me in real life, as you first knew me, repressed, unhappy, not wanting to interact with others or be seen. If I were to give her a name, I would call her \"Little Transparent.\"", "I: Well. One is called CICI, who is happy, relaxed, recognized, and shines. The other is called Little Transparent, who is repressed, unhappy, and even wishes not to be seen.", "I brought four chairs: two identical regular back chairs, a short round stool, and a tall bar stool, letting Lemon choose. Lemon chose one of the back chairs to be CICI and the short round stool to be the little transparent one. I placed the two stools opposite each other, and Lemon comfortably sat down in the back chair, sitting up straight with her legs naturally relaxed on the floor.", "I: I see you are now sitting in CICI's chair. Would you like to share your current thoughts and feelings? You can start with \"I am... I am feeling...\"", "Lemon: I am CICI, and I currently feel quite relaxed and at ease. I enjoy singing and listening to music. When I sing, I feel recognized and needed by everyone, and I really enjoy that feeling and like this side of myself.", "Me: Hmm, I can also feel your relaxation and ease. Would you like to sing a song you like for everyone now?", "Lemon thought for a moment and began to sing the classic Cantonese song, \"I like you, those captivating eyes, your laughter is even more enchanting, like yesterday...\" As she sang softly, I gently tapped the beat beside her, and a faint smile remained on Lemon's face.", "Me: CICI, there's a little invisible person sitting in the chair opposite you, she's also listening to you sing. Can you feel what she looks like right now?", "Lemon: The little transparent one is curled up in a chair, not wanting to look up at anyone or interact with others.", "Me: Well, do you want to say something to the little transparent one?", "Lemon: Little transparent, can you not shrink like this? I don’t like it when you do that. Please don’t be afraid or resist people, okay?", "Me: Well. You said to let the little transparent not to be afraid and resist people. It sounds like you really want to change the little transparent. What happened after you said that?", "Lemon: She seems to be more nervous and has shrunk even more.", "Me: Well, when you told her not to curl up like this, she curled up even more. Why is that? Do you want to experience her feelings?", "Lemon: Okay, I’m willing.", "I had Lemon turn around and sit on the small round stool across from me. As soon as she sat down, she curled up into a ball, leaning forward with her elbows resting on her knees, her palms weakly supporting her chin.", "Me: Little transparent, what do you feel or experience sitting here right now?", "Lemon: I feel very anxious. I don’t want to be seen by others or interact with anyone. Dealing with people makes me feel exhausted and stressed. I really wish no one could see me; I wish I were a transparent person.", "Me: Hmm, you seem very nervous. You wish to be a transparent person. Are there some people and things you don't want to face?", "Lemon: Yes. I always feel like a failure, and I can't help but think of some embarrassing scenes and experiences from the past. I also never know how to handle interpersonal relationships and can't cope with certain situations. I'm so tired...", "Me: You are too tired, and you must have made a lot of effort to change for this. What does it feel like to be a transparent person now? Are you willing to try to fully experience this feeling?", "Lemon covered her entire face with both hands, curling up even more. I picked up a thin blanket and wrapped it around her completely.", "Me: Now you are a transparent person, and no one can see you. How does it feel to be a transparent person?", "Lemon: I feel a lot better, much more relaxed.", "Me: Well, I'm much more relaxed now. Can you try to make a sentence using \"I am a transparent person, so...\"?", "Lemon: I am a transparent person, so no one sees me; I am a transparent person, so I don't have to care about others' opinions; I am a transparent person, so I don't have to worry about not performing well; I am a transparent person, so I don't have to care about my figure...", "Me: Being a transparent person actually sounds pretty good.", "(After finishing speaking, Lemon hid under the blanket and fell silent. Five minutes passed, and I saw her shoulders slowly shaking. Lemon started to cry under the blanket, her sobs gradually growing louder. I quietly stayed by her side until she calmed down and began to speak.)", "Lemon: I don't want to be invisible anymore, I don't want to run away, I want to change.", "(I removed the blanket from her.)", "I: You said you don't want to be a transparent person anymore.", "(Lemon straightened up and wiped the tears from her face.)", "Lemon: Yes, I want to change what I have to face.", "Me: Look at CICI over there, she's looking at you. Do you have something to say to her?", "Lemon: CICI, you are me, and I can also be brave and strong like you, liked by others and needed by them.", "I: You said to be brave and strong like CICI. She heard what you said. Do you want to experience her feelings again?", "(I invited Lemon to sit back down in the chair across from me.)", "Me: CICI, did you hear what the little transparent just said? Do you have anything to say to her?", "Lemon: Little transparent, you are very brave, I am proud of you, you will definitely become like me.", "Me: If you had to express your feelings about the little transparent one in the simplest way, what would you say or do?", "(Lemon pulled the small round stool from across the way closer to herself and made a hugging gesture. I noticed her mouth curling as if she wanted to say something several times, and finally, she gently spoke up.)", "Lemon: I love you, little transparent one.", "I: I didn't hear clearly, can you speak a little louder?", "Lemon: I love you, little transparent one.", "Me: Keep talking.", "Lemon: Little Transparent, I love you, I love you, I love you...", "Big tears flowed down Lemon's face, dripping onto the wooden floor with a plop. Lemon hugged herself tightly and didn't let go for a long time. Once Lemon's emotions finally calmed down, I guided her to take a few deep breaths, had her sit on the third chair next to us, and asked her to say something to each of the two chairs in front of her.", "Lemon touched the small round stool and said: \"Little Transparent, you can do it, believe that you will become stronger and stronger;\" then touched another chair and said: \"CICI, you are the best!\"", "Then I invited Lemon to make a gesture to express their current feelings.

Perhaps that is the desire deep within my heart.\""], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on the therapeutic journey with Lemon, it becomes evident that the two-chair technique in Gestalt therapy played a pivotal role in unraveling the complexities of her inner world. This case not only illuminated the dichotomy within Lemon's personality but also highlighted the transformative potential of therapeutic exploration in fostering self-awareness and growth.\n\nThe initial stages of therapy revealed Lemon's struggle with mild depressive symptoms, characterized by mood swings, low self-esteem, and a pronounced reliance on interpersonal relationships. These issues were intricately tied to her rigid beliefs and behavioral patterns, which stifled her self-acceptance and contributed to her sense of helplessness. Despite these challenges, Lemon exhibited a commendable level of social functioning and a proactive attitude towards seeking psychological counseling, which set a promising foundation for our therapeutic work.\n\nOver the course of six months, our sessions delved into various aspects of Lemon's life, from her intimate relationships and familial dynamics to her emotional distress and irrational belief systems. This comprehensive exploration gradually facilitated improvements in her relationships and enhanced her independence and initiative. Lemon's increased self-acceptance and understanding of her limiting patterns were significant milestones in our journey together.\n\nThe turning point came when Lemon's passion for live streaming her singing intersected with her therapeutic process. Her decision to end the live streaming highlighted a profound internal conflict: the tension between her desire to embrace a more fulfilling version of herself and the constraints imposed by her real-life persona. This conflict manifested in her emotional turmoil and restlessness, underscoring the importance of addressing these two extremes within her.\n\nThe two-chair technique provided a tangible framework for Lemon to engage in a dialogue between these contrasting parts of herself. By embodying \"CICI,\" the vibrant and confident aspect of her identity, and \"Little Transparent,\" the repressed and anxious part, Lemon was able to externalize and confront the internal struggle that had been inhibiting her growth.\n\nIn embodying CICI, Lemon experienced a sense of relaxation and joy, which starkly contrasted with the anxiety and exhaustion she felt as Little Transparent. This experiential process allowed Lemon to articulate the desires and fears that each aspect represented, paving the way for a deeper understanding of her internal landscape.\n\nAs CICI, Lemon expressed a love for singing and the recognition and need she felt from her audience. This side of her was a beacon of happiness, representing a world where she could thrive without the burdens of societal expectations and self-imposed limitations. In contrast, Little Transparent encapsulated Lemon's fears of failure, social pressure, and the desire to remain unseen—a coping mechanism she had developed to shield herself from perceived inadequacies.\n\nThe dialogue between these two facets of Lemon's identity revealed a profound insight: the need for integration and balance. Rather than viewing CICI and Little Transparent as mutually exclusive, the therapeutic process encouraged Lemon to embrace both as integral parts of her identity. This realization was pivotal in shifting Lemon's perspective from one of avoidance and self-criticism to one of acceptance and self-compassion.\n\nThrough this process, Lemon's tears and subsequent declarations of love for Little Transparent marked a significant emotional release and a step towards healing. By acknowledging and embracing her vulnerabilities, Lemon began to dismantle the rigid patterns that had been limiting her potential. Her desire to no longer be invisible signaled a newfound commitment to change and personal growth.\n\nIn reflecting on this journey, it becomes clear that the therapeutic alliance played a crucial role in facilitating these breakthroughs. The safe and supportive environment cultivated over our 25 sessions enabled Lemon to explore her inner world with honesty and courage. This trust allowed for the successful implementation of the two-chair technique, as Lemon felt empowered to confront and integrate her conflicting traits.\n\nFurthermore, this case underscores the importance of flexibility and adaptability in therapy. The dynamic nature of Gestalt therapy, particularly the two-chair technique, allowed for a nuanced exploration of Lemon's internal conflicts, providing a pathway for transformation that was uniquely tailored to her needs.\n\nIn conclusion, Lemon's case exemplifies the profound impact of Gestalt therapy in fostering self-awareness, integration, and growth. By facilitating a dialogue between her polarized traits, the therapeutic process not only illuminated Lemon's desires and fears but also empowered her to embrace a more authentic and fulfilling version of herself. This journey of self-discovery and acceptance has equipped Lemon with the tools to navigate future challenges with resilience and confidence, highlighting the enduring value of therapeutic exploration in the pursuit of personal growth.", "causes": "Personal personality factors (personality conflicts) and social factors (intimate relationships and career choices)", "symptoms": "depression", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection and relationship building;\nThe Empty Chair Technique in Gestalt Therapy: Bringing the Ideal Self into Dialogue with the Repressed Self;\nFree association: Exploring subconscious fears and desires.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Conflicts caused by inner desires and fears", "treatment_effect": "Self-acceptance and relationships with others are significantly improved, limiting beliefs are broken, and self-integration and self- awareness are promoted."}
{"id": 43, "case_description": ["Xiaoyang is a gentle girl, 25 years old, who graduated from university and started working in a public institution. Six months ago, she met a boyfriend through a relative's introduction. At first, her boyfriend treated her very well, but later, because he only focused on playing games at night, Xiaoyang felt neglected and complained to her mother. Her mother talked to the boyfriend for several hours. After that, the boyfriend seemed even colder towards Xiaoyang, and the relatives began to gossip, saying that Xiaoyang's inability to be accommodating would likely lead to future troubles. Xiaoyang also has several close female friends, and whenever she talks to them, they tell her that she is too insecure and should be more confident; everything would be fine. They say that this man is not that great and not worth her worrying so much.", "Xiao Yang said that it was her first time dating a boyfriend, and she was already feeling unsure. With the chatter from those around her, her mind was already a mess. Every day, she heard various voices echoing in her ears: \"You're too gentle; how can you trust your man in the future?\" \"You're used to a life of comfort; no matter who you marry, it's hard to have a good outcome.\" \"You lack confidence and aren't good at handling relationships between men and women; how could you possibly have a good romance?\" Xiao Yang knew she had her shortcomings, such as poor communication and being occasionally emotional, and she was working hard to change little by little. Now, with others pouring cold water on her, she felt inadequate in every way. If this relationship didn't succeed, she wouldn't have the confidence to date again in the future. She asked me in distress, realizing that she had problems all over and wondering if there was still hope for her."], "consultation_process": ["In Xiao Yang's first consultation, she mentioned that she had always listened to her mother since childhood. Her mother handled her relationships with teachers during her studies, and she was given special care at school. After graduation, her mother arranged a job for her early on, taking care of all the necessary considerations. In her romantic life, it was also her mother who had relatives introduce her to a boyfriend, saying that everyone knew him well and it was reassuring. Even now at 25, her mother still takes charge of what is good for her health and what looks good to wear.", "Xiao Yang is accustomed to her mother doing things for her, but on the other hand, she feels increasingly uncomfortable. However, she doesn't want to upset her mother, as she knows that her parents have had a strained relationship for years and that her mother has worried herself sick for her. Her mother's mantra is: \"I watched you grow up; you haven't experienced hardship, and you have no abilities now. How can I let go?\"", "Xiaoyang said that it was precisely because she knew her mother was doing it for her own good that she tried every means to help herself, but she didn't know how to grow. In the eyes of her mother, relatives, and friends, she was still an innocent little girl. Although what they said was true, she felt uncomfortable in her heart and didn't know how to refute it, only constantly blaming herself for being so disappointing.", "When we take a deeper look at Xiaoyang's support system, we find that they all speak in the same tone, expressing blame towards Xiaoyang for not being good enough and for making the wrong choices and decisions. However, it is clear that they are not truly helping her; instead, they are making her feel even more disheartened. As she gradually accepts that she is immature, lacks ability, and has no opinion of her own, her confidence in herself diminishes. She no longer dares to trust herself and feels the need to seek help from family or friends whenever she encounters challenges. By constantly seeking assistance and hesitating to try things on her own, she further internalizes her friends' and family's judgments that she is incompetent and cannot manage her own life. In this way, Xiaoyang becomes trapped in a vicious cycle, with her life getting worse and her self-hatred increasing.", "After the first consultation, Xiao Yang said she recalled some past events. It wasn't that she didn't have her own thoughts; it was just that she had become accustomed to everyone's decisions, and her own opinions had been overlooked. Remembering these things, she felt as if she had gained a little more hope.", "Xiao Yang returned home and immediately told his mother about his experiences. His mother said, \"It's still your fault for having such poor mental resilience. Otherwise, why would you need to see a psychologist? I've told you so many times, but you just won't listen and insist on consulting a therapist.\" Xiao Yang felt as if the world, which had just begun to shine brightly, had suddenly fallen back into the depths of darkness.", "I asked Xiao Yang: You know that mom might not support you, so why do you still want to tell her? Xiao Yang said: I don't know either. I can guess what mom will say before I speak. But I always feel that I've made some progress, and I hope mom can see my progress. I asked: Has mom seen it? Xiao Yang shook his head in disappointment. I said: A single word from mom can turn you back to square one. You are 25 years old now, but you look like you're only 10. If you want to grow up a bit, you need to be careful that mom doesn't turn you back into an 8 or 5-year-old child.", "Later, Xiao Yang asked again: What if I don't let them help, and I can't do it well? We see that Xiao Yang has actually developed to this state—poor independence, lack of confidence, and inability to express her thoughts well—all as a result of her interaction with the existing support system. It's as if she herself is a product of this circle, and when she encounters difficulties and seeks help from everyone, it becomes hard for her to see different possibilities.", "In Xiaoyang's eight counseling sessions, techniques from cognitive behavioral therapy, narrative therapy, and family therapy were primarily integrated to help Xiaoyang develop reflexive thinking about her interactions with others, cultivate awareness of the limiting patterns to her personal growth, and, through subsequent supportive therapy, gradually establish cognitive and behavioral patterns more conducive to her growth, forming new interaction patterns with her surrounding environment.", "Xiao Yang's counseling has ended for half a year now. Upon follow-up, she has started to bravely face the issues with her boyfriend and has established certain self-boundaries to protect herself when her mother tries to interfere in her actions. She is becoming more confident in both work and life, and is better able to express her true thoughts than before. People around her say she seems like a different person. She mentioned that she used to think her personality was fixed and hard to change. Through counseling, she gradually discovered her strengths and resources, and realized that her problems also had family factors involved. She found that she wasn't powerless in the face of challenges; instead, she could bravely and actively make new attempts. As these attempts began to be effective, she started to like this new version of herself more and more."], "experience_and_reflection": "The discourse of success studies has long emphasized the role of social circles. To accomplish anything, one needs a network; developing one's abilities to the fullest occurs within a supportive platform and environment. Most people facing difficulties and seeking change actually have a circle around them, which may consist of family, friends, best friends, or colleagues. While a circle can provide significant support, it can also suppress further growth opportunities. Xiaoyang’s journey underscores this duality, illustrating both the power and peril inherent in one’s support system.\n\nReflecting further on Xiaoyang's case, it becomes apparent that her journey was not just about overcoming personal insecurities but also about redefining her relationship with her environment. From a young age, Xiaoyang was enveloped in a cocoon of well-intentioned oversight. Her mother, with the best of intentions, orchestrated her life to shield her from adversity. This shield, while protective, also became a barrier to Xiaoyang's personal growth, stunting her ability to make autonomous decisions and cultivate resilience.\n\nXiaoyang’s experience is a poignant reminder of how familial dynamics can shape an individual’s self-perception and decision-making abilities. Her mother’s narrative, asserting Xiaoyang’s incompetence, became a self-fulfilling prophecy. By constantly stepping in to manage Xiaoyang’s affairs, her mother inadvertently reinforced the notion that Xiaoyang could not succeed independently. This protective interference, though meant to safeguard, became a significant contributor to Xiaoyang's feelings of inadequacy.\n\nIn psychotherapy, it is crucial to recognize how such dynamics manifest in clients’ lives. Xiaoyang’s case highlights the importance of helping clients disentangle themselves from these ingrained familial roles. This process involves not only encouraging clients to explore their personal narratives but also to challenge the narratives imposed upon them by their support systems. For Xiaoyang, developing a sense of self-efficacy meant confronting the deeply rooted belief that she was perpetually reliant on her mother’s guidance.\n\nIn fact, everyone who wants to change has a natural force resisting that change, because changing our behavior feels as uncomfortable as putting on new clothes. However, only by daring to try can we manage the future we desire according to our own ideas. Making mistakes is not terrifying; what is terrifying is continuously following someone else's idea of the right path, a path you don't even agree with. Giving up control over your life is the biggest mistake, as there is neither experience gained nor growth, just aimlessly drifting along.\n\nThrough cognitive behavioral therapy, Xiaoyang was able to identify and challenge the cognitive distortions that had taken root in her psyche. These included beliefs about her inability to handle relationships and her perceived need to conform to others’ expectations. The therapeutic process enabled her to reframe these distortions and recognize her own strengths. By doing so, Xiaoyang began to forge a new path—one characterized by self-discovery and empowerment.\n\nIn consultations, we often encounter good girls who are troubled, surrounded by people constantly giving them advice with the intention of helping, telling them what they should do and how they should choose. However, every conversation leaves them feeling more dejected. Xiaoyang’s friends and relatives, despite their good intentions, contributed to her sense of helplessness. Their constant advice, rather than empowering her, served as a reminder of her perceived shortcomings.\n\nIf you are also a well-behaved girl and have such people around you, please try to reflect more on how your past energy has been diminished, and consider how you have obediently chosen to revert to being a compliant 10-year-old child. We often talk about harsh truths, but what truly helps the person involved is not ignoring their ability to make autonomous choices. Each person facing difficulties does not need to seek clarity amidst turmoil; instead, they need a space of acceptance without blame, allowing them to sort themselves out, which will lead to more change and greater possibilities in life.\n\nCreating a therapeutic environment where clients feel safe to explore their thoughts and feelings without judgment is paramount. For Xiaoyang, this meant providing a space where she could voice her doubts and fears without the expectation of immediate answers or solutions. It was in this space that Xiaoyang began to untangle the complex web of expectations that had been woven around her. By exploring these narratives, she found the courage to redefine her own story.\n\nXiaoyang’s progress highlights the transformative power of therapy in fostering self-awareness and resilience. As she engaged in therapy, Xiaoyang learned to identify the patterns that had been holding her back. She recognized that her hesitancy to assert herself in her relationship with her boyfriend was not merely a personal failing but a reflection of the broader narrative that had shaped her life.\n\nOne significant turning point in Xiaoyang's journey was her realization that she had the capacity to change her circumstances. This realization was bolstered by the therapeutic techniques employed, which encouraged her to experiment with new behaviors and thought patterns. By taking incremental steps towards autonomy, Xiaoyang began to see that change was possible.\n\nXiaoyang’s case also underscores the importance of narrative therapy in helping clients reauthor their stories. By examining the dominant narratives in her life, Xiaoyang was able to identify the ways in which these narratives had limited her potential. Through narrative therapy, she began to construct a new narrative—one that acknowledged her strengths and aspirations.\n\nFamily therapy also played a critical role in Xiaoyang’s journey. By examining the family dynamics that had influenced her development, Xiaoyang gained insight into the ways in which her mother’s protective instincts had both helped and hindered her. This understanding enabled Xiaoyang to establish healthier boundaries with her mother, thereby fostering a more balanced relationship.\n\nUltimately, Xiaoyang’s journey is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit. Through therapy, she discovered that she was not powerless in the face of challenges. Instead, she learned to draw on her inner resources and embrace the uncertainty that comes with growth. As Xiaoyang began to make new attempts and take ownership of her life, she found that she liked this new version of herself more and more.\n\nFor clinicians, Xiaoyang’s case serves as a reminder of the importance of adopting a holistic approach to therapy. By integrating cognitive behavioral therapy, narrative therapy, and family therapy, we can help clients address the multifaceted nature of their challenges. This comprehensive approach not only facilitates personal growth but also empowers clients to navigate their social environments with greater confidence.\n\nAs we reflect on Xiaoyang’s journey, we are reminded of the profound impact that therapy can have in helping individuals reclaim their narratives and redefine their futures. By fostering a therapeutic environment that prioritizes self-exploration and empowerment, we can help clients like Xiaoyang break free from the constraints of their past and embrace the possibilities of the future.", "causes": "Early upbringing environment (overprotective) and\npersonal personality factors", "symptoms": "Relationship anxiety, low self-esteem", "treatment_process": "Gather basic information, build relationships, and set goals; Cognitive-behavioral therapy: challenging irrational beliefs;\nNarrative Therapy: Constructing new perspectives that can reveal one's strengths and ambitions;\nFamily Systems Therapy: Understanding that the mother's overprotection is a double-edged sword.", "characteristics_of_illness": "The separation from the mother is not yet complete", "treatment_effect": "It provides a space for free expression, helps visitors to be aware  of the impact of the family on them, and guides them to make positive changes and adjustments, which improves self-confidence and self-    worth, and adopts more adaptive strategies to deal with problems."}
{"id": 44, "case_description": ["The visitor is clear-minded, self-aware, and slightly withdrawn in behavior. They came to the hospital in pajamas for a consultation and are in poor mental state. After receiving medication at the psychiatric outpatient clinic, they came for psychological counseling. Their emotions are quite anxious, and after sitting in the counseling room for a while, they get up to walk around and then sit back down. They experience palpitations, restlessness, and fear that something bad might happen, feeling worried but unsure of what exactly they are anxious about. Sometimes, they hear their own heartbeat and press their hand against their chest, fearing that their heart might leap out. Their husband passed away from cancer over two years ago, and they have a daughter who has graduated with a master's degree and is teaching. They underwent brain surgery a year ago and have since recovered."], "consultation_process": ["IV. Detailed Record of the First Consultation: \nCounselor: How can I help you today? \nVisitor: Doctor, I feel very uncomfortable and distressed inside. \nCounselor: Can you specify what exactly feels uncomfortable? \nVisitor: I can't really say, it's just a feeling of panic. I often feel my heart racing and am constantly worried. I feel uncomfortable whether I'm sitting, standing, or lying down, and I don't even know what I'm worried about. Sometimes I can hear my heartbeat and I press my hand against my chest, fearing my heart might jump out. (Stands up and walks around the counseling room before sitting down again) \nCounselor: Has anything happened recently that made you feel uncomfortable? \nVisitor: Nothing specific, but suddenly I feel very scared, like something is going to happen. \nCounselor: Can you recall if anything in the past made you feel scared? \nVisitor: Yes, my partner left us. (After a moment of silence, the visitor says this while crying.) \nCounselor: Would you like to talk about your partner leaving you? \nVisitor: My partner had lung cancer. The doctors at the tumor hospital said he couldn't be saved, but I didn't give up and spent a lot of money on several treatments. He suffered a lot during the treatment and in the end, we still couldn't save him. He left us forever. \nCounselor: Losing a loved one is indeed very painful and sad. I feel sorry for you hearing this. \nVisitor: The main thing is that he was very young. My partner was two years younger than me and was the pillar of our family. He didn't smoke or drink, so how could he get such a terrible illness? \nCounselor: It seems that even after two years, you still can't accept the fact of your partner's passing, right? \nVisitor: Yes! Sometimes I think about how wonderful life would be if he were still alive. \nCounselor: How was your relationship with your partner? \nVisitor: My partner was very good. He treated both me and our daughter well and took care of my family. He made all the decisions in our family, handling everything big and small. Family and friends respected him, and he did well in business, earning a lot of money for us. We bought several houses and a storefront, so we lived quite well in the family. \nCounselor: Your partner played a very important role in the family. I’d like to know, did you ever argue with him? \nVisitor: We had arguments. He often scolded me, saying women are shallow and look down on us. If I did something he was unhappy with, he would complain that I wasn't clear about things. \nCounselor: If your partner were still here, would you still argue? \nVisitor: No way, couples argue. There was a time we argued fiercely, and he even pushed me hard. I ran back to my parents' home. He was a bit stubborn and very patriarchal, as if everyone had to listen to him; otherwise, he would give you a hard time. \nCounselor: It sounds like what you just said doesn't quite align with the wonderful life you described earlier. Perhaps since your partner passed away, you only remember the good parts of him, and everything seems beautiful in your memories, while reality feels particularly painful. \nVisitor: It seems to be like that. My memories are beautiful, and I feel that real life is particularly cruel, making me feel especially cold. (Visitor stands up and walks around, saying it's too cold and needs to lower the air conditioning.) \nCounselor: You feel that after your husband passed away, facing life alone is very difficult, and it makes you feel cold inside. \nVisitor: Yes, after my husband passed, my mother-in-law started fighting me over the inheritance, causing a lot of noise, which led to my subsequent brain surgery. \nCounselor: Are you saying your mother-in-law is fighting you over the inheritance? \nVisitor: Yes! My mother-in-law has a very strong controlling nature. Since my partner and I only have one daughter, before my husband passed away from cancer, she kept saying she wanted to adopt her brother's son, claiming that after our daughter gets married, she would take all the family assets away, and my mother-in-law values sons over daughters. But we only have one daughter; no matter how much money or how many houses we have, everything should be left to her. She won't give a penny to her grandson. Besides, how can parents not leave money to their biological daughter but instead to a nephew? My husband's brother's family lives in Hong Kong and rarely visits, so they aren't close at all. So when my husband knew he didn't have much time left, he transferred all the money in his account to me and had the houses transferred to my name. I also made a will stating that these assets would belong to my daughter. This way, my mother-in-law wouldn't get anything, but she was very angry when she found out and made a big scene in the hospital, accusing us of being unfilial. After my husband passed, she incited relatives and friends to pressure me into giving them one or two houses, but I got angry and refused to give them anything. However, they wouldn't give up and kept coming in turns. My daughter’s aunt even instructed her daughter, my daughter's cousin, to borrow money from my daughter. Originally, the two kids got along well, but now because of the money issue, my daughter doesn't associate with her cousin anymore. \nCounselor: Your mother-in-law's series of actions has hurt you, and perhaps you feel as if you're standing in opposition to your relatives. \nVisitor: Yes, after my husband left us, we became like orphans; they teamed up to bully us. \nCounselor: Can you specify who \"they\" are? \nVisitor: They are my husband's sister and her husband, along with my mother-in-law and father-in-law, my brother-in-law and sister-in-law, and my uncle and aunt; a whole bunch of people scheming for our family assets. My husband and I worked hard for everything, and it was all supposed to be left to my daughter, but they all want to take it. During that time, it was so chaotic that I felt my head was about to explode. \nCounselor: Have you consulted a lawyer about the inheritance issue? \nVisitor: Yes, when my husband was alive, he was worried that my daughter's rightful assets would be taken away, so we consulted a lawyer together and specifically wrote a will to leave everything to my daughter. My mother-in-law couldn't get anything, so she threw tantrums, cursing at us. After that, my husband passed, and she encouraged relatives and friends to pressure me into giving them a couple of houses, but I got furious and refused to give them anything. \nCounselor: Did you and your partner agree to leave all your assets to your daughter? \nVisitor: Of course. My mother-in-law and her husband have their retirement pensions and don't lack money. They want to take my property for their grandson, which definitely won't work here. Legally, we have an obligation to support them, and if it's just giving them some money every month, I can accept that; everything else is off the table. \nCounselor: I think the core of the conflict is that your mother-in-law wants to pass on her son's inheritance to her grandson, but unfortunately, your child is a daughter. If she had a son, your mother-in-law probably wouldn't be in conflict with you. \nVisitor: My mother-in-law thinks I’m an outsider; when my daughter gets married, she’s going to another family, and the wealth accumulated by her son will be taken away, not kept in the Liu family. \nCounselor: Perhaps this is a clash of values—between modern thinking and traditional beliefs. Many older people from that era have such views. \nVisitor: Yes, in my hometown, parents’ inheritance is only divided among sons, not daughters. I didn't get a single thing when my father passed away. \nCounselor: I think this is a deeply ingrained custom, so your mother-in-law’s intense reactions stem from outdated beliefs. Your and your partner’s decisions challenge these old notions, which is why so many people are opposing you, making you feel very alone, helpless, and frustrated. \nVisitor: Doctor, this explanation is the first I’ve heard in a long time, and it seems to touch on some of these factors. \nCounselor: If you understand your partner's family's behavior this way, do you feel any relief? \nVisitor: Yes, it seems I feel a bit of understanding; I think they have their reasons too. \nCounselor: Alright, today you talked about the pain of losing your partner and the conflict over the inheritance with your in-laws. The time is almost up, so let's take a break for now. If there's anything you want to say, we can save it for next time, okay? \nVisitor: Okay, thank you, Doctor. \nCounselor: You're welcome. See you next week. \n\nSecond Consultation Situation: \nVisitor's Complaint: After my partner's passing, according to tradition, my daughter was supposed to get married within a hundred days. Originally, my daughter's aunt and uncle had promised to help receive the in-laws and guests, but unexpectedly, they were swayed by my mother-in-law, and none of her relatives showed up. Thankfully, my brothers from my side are doing well; my eldest brother called a few subordinates to help, and we finally managed to hold my daughter's wedding successfully. But this sudden withdrawal felt like a betrayal, as if my daughter and I had been abandoned. Since then, we have cut off contact with them.\n\nThird Consultation Situation: \nVisitor's Complaint: Not long after my daughter's wedding, I suddenly fainted at home. My daughter immediately called 110 and sent me to the hospital. They said it was a rupture of a blood vessel in my brain. Thankfully, I was sent to the hospital in time for emergency treatment, and I survived after undergoing surgery. Due to my poor health, I moved back to my parents' home, where there is a caregiver to cook and clean, allowing me to recuperate. Currently, my mother and my younger brother's family are living there. When my partner was alive, my brother and sister-in-law listened to him and respected me as their elder sister. If my brother didn’t handle something well, my husband would scold him directly. But now that my husband is gone, my brother thinks he’s the head of the family and has become quite self-righteous, speaking loudly to me and not showing the same respect as before. I buy all the groceries for the family, including my mother's pigeon soup, my fish, and my nephew's beef, spending a couple of hundred yuan every day. I thought my brother and sister-in-law would respect me greatly for all my contributions, but that’s not the case.\n\nFourth Consultation Situation: \nVisitor's Complaint: My mother has a mental disorder and has been taking medication at your hospital. Now that she’s older, she sometimes has moments of clarity and sometimes confusion. The caregiver is responsible for taking care of my mother and cooking. After my partner passed, my father was diagnosed with late-stage liver cancer. The doctors at the city hospital said treatment was unnecessary, but I insisted on taking him to the tumor hospital in Fuzhou for treatment. At that time, my brother, sister-in-law, and others didn’t agree with my decision and even tried to persuade me otherwise, but I stood firm and insisted on treating my father. After treatment, he lived for two more years but eventually passed. In his last moments, he divided the family assets between my brother and my younger brother, leaving me in charge of his funeral arrangements. He was afraid of spending his sons' money, so he looked to me for financial matters. I actually didn’t mind, as we are family, but the more I thought about it later, the more uncomfortable I felt. I treated my father very well; after his surgery, he said he wanted to travel to Dubai, and I even gave him 20,000 yuan to go with his comrades. But in his eyes, I am just not the same as his sons.\n\nFifth Consultation Situation: \nVisitor's Complaint: I’ve become particularly sensitive about money issues. The house under my daughter's name was purchased before her wedding, so it's considered her pre-marital property. However, my son-in-law seems a bit uncomfortable with that, but I don’t care. Once they came over to play cards with me, and I teamed up with my nephew to pressure him, which made him very unhappy. My current will states that all my assets will go to my daughter and have nothing to do with my son-in-law, but he doesn’t know this. In fact, my son-in-law is very filial and treats me well, but I don’t know why I feel defensive around him.\n\nSixth Consultation Situation: \nVisitor's Complaint: Ever since I got sick, I’ve been staying at home, rarely going out or communicating with others. Today, my sister-in-law’s sister came over, and while chatting with her, I found myself very anxious to present myself well, speaking hurriedly as if to show her that I’m doing fine. After she left, I felt extremely exhausted and collapsed onto the bed upstairs, lacking the strength to even breathe. I rested for a long time before I had the energy to go downstairs to eat, but my appetite has become very poor, and I can't eat. I also experienced hand tremors; I used to have them only when drinking water, but that day, I was doing nothing and still trembled.\n\nSeventh Consultation Situation: \nVisitor's Complaint: My daughter took me out for dinner. Initially, I didn't want to go, but they kept persuading me, and I reluctantly went. Unexpectedly, I felt quite good; after dinner, we walked around and I realized that it was the happiest day I had had since my partner passed away. Later that evening, I also walked in the park for an hour, but after a few days, I found it unbearable. I seem to take things to extremes, only stopping when I reach a point where I can't handle it anymore.\n\nEighth Consultation Situation: \nVisitor's Complaint: Recently, I only walk for 20 minutes every night. Encouraged by my daughter, I took out my old electric bike to ride. I thought I wouldn't be able to ride anymore, but unexpectedly, I rode quite well. Recently, my daughter's aunt visited her school to understand her situation. It seems her aunt and uncle are planning to move the whole family to Hong Kong, so they want to know how my daughter is doing in school and may need her to take care of my mother-in-law. I told my daughter not to forget the lessons from the past and not to get involved with them.\n\nNinth Consultation Situation: \nVisitor's Complaint: I feel very sorry for my daughter and son-in-law. My son-in-law's father passed away suddenly from a heart attack. His father-in-law was the local police chief and used to handle many matters; now his wife can’t do anything. My daughter and son-in-law have gone to Anhui for the funeral, and I’m not sure how they are managing the arrangements. Now, neither side of our family has a pillar to rely on; these two kids are truly unfortunate, and our family has really faced many calamities.\n\nTenth Consultation Situation: \nVisitor's Complaint: My daughter and son-in-law came back, bringing my daughter-in-law and the baby with them. My granddaughter has been growing up in Anhui with her grandparents, and since I’ve been sick, I couldn’t take care of her. Today, I saw my daughter-in-law looking very distressed, wanting to say something but hesitating. I didn’t dare to speak to her, fearing I might hurt her. Her pain is something I have experienced, and I initially wanted to talk with her, but suddenly I didn’t know how to start and felt too timid, so I just bought a lot of seafood for her and asked the caregiver to prepare a feast for them. However, after returning to my parents' home, I couldn't control the memories of my partner's passing, replaying in my mind over and over. I felt like I was suffocating with pain, and the illness I had just recovered from came back to haunt me. While at home, I was eagerly looking forward to seeing the doctor, and my vague memories suddenly became clear."], "experience_and_reflection": "Grief counseling and therapy are crucial therapeutic interventions designed to support individuals who have experienced the profound loss of a loved one. In this case, the visitor presents with a complex and multifaceted grief response, characterized by a mixture of anxiety, physical symptoms, and an ongoing struggle with unresolved emotions and familial conflicts. As I reflect on the sessions and the visitor’s experiences, it becomes increasingly evident that grief is not merely an emotional state but a multifaceted process that requires careful navigation and resolution.\n\nInitially, the visitor exhibited signs of acute anxiety and panic, symptoms often associated with unresolved grief. These manifestations—palpitations, restlessness, and an overwhelming sense of impending doom—are indicative of the profound psychological distress that can accompany the mourning process. It is important to recognize that these symptoms are not uncommon among those grieving, as the body and mind react to the loss in deeply interconnected ways. The visitor's experiences highlight the necessity for a holistic approach to grief counseling, one that addresses both the psychological and physiological impacts of loss.\n\nFrom the first consultation, it became clear that the visitor's grief was complicated by unresolved familial tensions and financial disputes following the death of their husband. The visitor's recounting of these conflicts with in-laws over inheritance issues adds a layer of complexity to their mourning process. Such conflicts can exacerbate feelings of isolation and helplessness, hindering the natural progression of grief. The visitor's narrative illustrates how grief can be compounded by external stressors, necessitating a therapeutic approach that not only addresses the emotional pain of loss but also helps individuals navigate the practical and relational challenges that arise in the aftermath of a loved one's death.\n\nThe visitor's account of their relationship with their deceased partner reveals a pattern of idealization post-mortem, which is a common psychological defense mechanism employed to cope with the finality of loss. This idealization can serve as a barrier to accepting the reality of the death and processing the full spectrum of emotions associated with the relationship. In the counseling sessions, it was essential to gently challenge this idealization, helping the visitor acknowledge and integrate both the positive and negative aspects of their relationship. By doing so, the visitor could begin to reconcile their memories with the present reality, a crucial step in moving forward.\n\nThroughout the consultations, the visitor expressed feelings of betrayal and abandonment by family members, particularly in the context of their daughter's wedding and the subsequent inheritance disputes. These experiences underscore the importance of addressing interpersonal dynamics and unresolved familial issues within grief therapy. The visitor's sense of betrayal may have been amplified by their own unresolved grief, leading to heightened emotional responses and a prolonged mourning period. Addressing these relational wounds in therapy is vital for the visitor to find closure and regain a sense of agency and stability in their life.\n\nMoreover, the visitor's physical health concerns, including the rupture of a blood vessel in the brain, highlight the interconnectedness of physical and emotional health during the grieving process. The stress and emotional turmoil experienced by the visitor likely contributed to their physical ailments, serving as a somatic expression of their unresolved grief. This case illustrates the necessity for a comprehensive treatment plan that integrates medical care with psychological support, ensuring that the visitor receives holistic care that addresses both the mind and body.\n\nIn the subsequent consultations, the visitor's evolving relationship with their daughter and son-in-law, and their reflections on familial roles and inheritance, provide further insight into the complexities of their grief. The visitor's heightened sensitivity to financial matters and their protective stance regarding their daughter's future suggest a deep-seated need for control and security, likely stemming from the unpredictability and loss experienced in recent years. Therapy must explore these themes, helping the visitor to find a balance between protective instincts and openness to new familial dynamics.\n\nThe visitor's recounting of their interactions with extended family members, particularly their brother and sister-in-law, reveals underlying tensions and a shifting family hierarchy in the absence of the visitor's husband. These changes have likely contributed to the visitor's feelings of instability and vulnerability. Therapy should focus on helping the visitor renegotiate their role within the family, fostering a sense of empowerment and self-efficacy in the face of shifting familial dynamics.\n\nThroughout the therapeutic process, it is essential to validate the visitor's experiences and emotions, creating a safe space for them to express their grief and explore their internal landscape. Techniques such as the empty chair method and cognitive-behavioral interventions can facilitate this exploration, allowing the visitor to confront unresolved emotions and develop adaptive coping strategies. Additionally, supportive psychotherapy can provide the visitor with the reassurance and guidance needed to navigate the complexities of their grief journey.\n\nAs the visitor progresses through therapy, it is important to recognize that grief is not a linear process but a cyclical one, with individuals often revisiting emotions and memories as they integrate their loss into their ongoing life narrative. Encouraging the visitor to engage in self-compassion and allowing for the natural ebb and flow of grief can help them move towards acceptance and healing.\n\nIn conclusion, the visitor's case exemplifies the intricate interplay between grief, familial dynamics, and physical health. It underscores the need for a nuanced and individualized approach to grief therapy, one that considers the unique context and challenges faced by each individual. By addressing the multifaceted nature of grief and providing comprehensive support, therapists can help individuals like the visitor find a path to healing and reconciliation, ultimately allowing them to honor their loved ones while embracing the possibilities of the future.", "causes": "Physiological, traumatic events (death of husband) and social factors (distribution of inheritance)", "symptoms": "anxiety", "treatment_process": "Gather basic information, build relationships, and set goals;\nCognitive-behavioral therapy and the empty chair  technique: exploring and challenging irrational beliefs;\nHumanistic Therapy and Supportive Psychotherapy: Listening, Empathy, Repetition.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Traumatic events and physical factors", "treatment_effect": "Helping the client to be aware of and alleviate negative emotions can alleviate the adverse effects of other negative events, break the  negative cycle, and challenge some of the client's thoughts to help them face life and solve problems faster."}

Due to taking a year off from school, they are now studying at home every day, reading, and helping their mother take care of the small shop."], "consultation_process": ["Consultation Record on October 4, 2020: The visitor appeared to be in poor spirits, emaciated, not very tall, very quiet, introverted, and not good at expressing herself. She preferred to keep things to herself and usually enjoyed reading the novel \"Dream of the Red Chamber,\" admiring the talent and temperament of the character Lin Daiyu. Due to not taking classes seriously during the pandemic, her exam results did not meet her parents' expectations, leading to feelings of anxiety and a sense of inadequacy. She felt she was failing to live up to her parents' expectations and found life meaningless, even contemplating death, but ultimately couldn't bear to leave her mother. Therefore, she asked her mother to bring her for psychological counseling and expressed a desire to take a break from school, feeling disgusted with studying.\n\nI listened attentively to her expression. At the beginning of the consultation, she was very timid, speaking softly and hesitating to express herself. Through my repeated encouragement that this was a safe space and that the teacher would keep things confidential, I reassured her that she could discuss her thoughts here without fear of judgment or repercussions. As long as she was being honest, it was okay to share her real feelings. She nodded and slowly began to recount her inner turmoil.\n\nThe visitor grew up in another place and had only recently moved. She was not adapting well to the new environment, lacked close friends, and was not fond of socializing. She was also unfamiliar with the teachers at her new school. Her father had very high expectations for her, insisting that she study every day at home to demonstrate to him that she was learning. She read literature, enjoyed history, poetry, and similar subjects. After the pandemic, her exam results were not ideal, and she felt guilty towards her father and brother, thinking she was not good enough, feeling exhausted with life, and wanting to die. However, she was also worried about making her mother sad, which prompted her to seek psychological counseling for help.\n\nUsing empathetic techniques, I aimed to understand her psychological feelings. A child who should be able to live happily and easily, and do her best to complete the homework assigned by teachers, was instead burdened with heavy pressures that hindered her learning engagement and efficiency. Therefore, parents should avoid placing excessive pressure on their children and should not impose their own desires on them, as this can negatively affect the child's performance. I noticed that the child was intelligent, sharing insightful comments about historical stories and character traits, indicating her love for reading in that area. She was quiet and preferred to stay close to her mother. During the initial consultation, I chose topics that the visitor liked and could accept, which helped bridge the gap between us and establish a good counseling relationship.", "2020.10.5 Consultation Record: Through yesterday's communication, the visitor seemed more relaxed. I asked her how she slept last night, and she replied it was okay. Did she still have thoughts of self-harm? She said, \"Since I came to see you, I have not had those thoughts. I am willing to discuss and solve my problems with you. I don't want to study now; I want to drop out, but my dad will get angry, and I'm afraid of him. My mom is also afraid of him. What should I do?\" Based on your current condition, your depression is quite severe, and it is not suitable for you to attend school. You can ask your school teachers for leave, and after being discharged, you can go through the procedures for dropping out. Don't worry about this issue; you can rest assured and cooperate with the upcoming treatment until you recover and return home. The child usually does not dare to express her thoughts and needs, and the oppressive family atmosphere leads her to unwillingly communicate with her parents. She isolates herself in her room to read, resulting in a strained parent-child relationship. When issues arise, they are not resolved in a timely manner, causing depression. Encourage the child to express her thoughts and ask the parents to participate in the consultation together to listen to the child's inner thoughts and feelings. Parents should not only provide material satisfaction but also understand the child's inner needs, what she wants, how to help her, understand her, and support her. This will foster a good parent-child relationship, allowing the child to feel the warmth of the family and the love of relatives, giving her more confidence to complete her studies and feel happier inside.", "Consultation record on October 6, 2020: Through the previous two communications, the child has relaxed a lot in front of me, her tone of voice has become more lively, and she even shows smiles. I guide her in relaxation training, mindfulness stress reduction, and alleviating anxiety and depression every day.", "Consultation record on October 7, 2020: Today, I discussed with the child how unreasonable cognitive patterns can lead to negative emotions and behaviors. The main types of distorted cognition include: subjective judgment, overgeneralization, exaggeration and minimization, labeling and mislabeling, personalization, extreme thinking, should statements, emotional reasoning, catastrophic thinking, and black-and-white thinking. Some people view problems without enough objectivity and reality, always seeing issues through their subjective feelings, even projecting their thoughts onto others, which causes a lot of distress. Some problems need to be clarified in person, expressing one's thoughts in an affirmative tone, and exchanging opinions. If your dad communicated with you in this way, you wouldn't feel so painful. He also doesn't know that you are hurt; internally, you resent him and reject him. If he knew he was hurting you, he would surely regret it and feel guilty. Therefore, it is important to open up and communicate, expressing your true thoughts. Misunderstandings and conflicts will decrease, leading to a healthy parent-child relationship.", "Consultation record on October 8, 2020: After several consultations, here is a summary: The visitor feels much more relaxed today, able to express their thoughts and feelings comfortably, no longer tense or afraid, unlike at home where they were hesitant to speak. Sometimes when the mother is around, the child mentions that the mother is kind but not expressive. I sense that the relationship between the child's parents is not very harmonious; improving the couple's relationship will lead to a better parent-child relationship.", "Consultation Record on October 9, 2020: Today, I had a consultation with the child's mother alone, as the child's father was unable to attend due to work commitments. The child's mother is introverted and doesn't like to talk; the visitor shares the same personality as her mother. The mother is a small business owner who runs a restaurant and has little education. The father works as a forestry manager and is usually very busy, with little time at home. He has a quick temper and tends to get angry easily. Due to poor family conditions in his childhood, he did not attend college and hopes that his children will be able to attend higher education institutions. Their son has been accepted into a prestigious university and is now working in Shanghai, which makes them very proud, and many people in their local area admire them for it. Their youngest daughter is 13 years younger than her brother, and they are now focusing their energy on her, hoping that she can also attend a prestigious university like her brother, which would make them proud and satisfied. Therefore, they have very high expectations for their daughter. The couple often has conflicts regarding the child's education; the wife is very concerned about the child, who used to perform well academically. However, after moving, the child has struggled to adapt to the new environment, lacks friends, and, coupled with the pandemic, has not been attending classes seriously, resulting in unsatisfactory exam results. The father has begun to blame the child, who has a strong sense of self-esteem and feels inadequate, thinking life has no meaning and wanting to escape. Fortunately, the child seeks help and comes to see a psychological counselor to express their true thoughts, which is essential for resolving their inner turmoil.", "Consultation Record on October 10, 2020: In a family, the relationship between husband and wife is the core relationship. Mutual respect between spouses is the best education for children. Children have a strong ability to imitate, and parents' words and actions have a significant impact on them. A father's respect for the child's mother allows the child to feel that the parents' educational philosophy is consistent, leading to the child's recognition of the parents, and stabilizing the child's inner structure. Conversely, if parents are always arguing and fighting, the child grows up in an environment filled with fear, leading to internal conflict and contradictions. Over time, the child may develop tendencies to avoid, withdraw, and feel inferior. Therefore, the way parents interact has a significant impact on the child's mental health.", "Consultation Record on October 17, 2020: Today, I discussed the importance of parent-child relationships with the child and the child's mother. How to establish a good parent-child relationship? It is not easy for parents to raise a child to adulthood; they not only need to provide for their basic needs but also nurture them into mature individuals. Parents are the child's first teachers, and the family is a factory for shaping personality. Parents hope their children will grow up to be successful. What support can parents provide for their children, and what kind of influence do they have—positive or negative? Some parents complain about their children, but are they themselves considered successful in front of other parents? If they are not, and if they do not provide support and help to their children, expecting the children to obey them while the children have their own judgments, then parents should be more aware and reflective.", "Consultation Record 2020.10.24; After several psychological counseling sessions, the child's mental state has improved a lot. Sometimes they go out to the park with their mother, take walks after dinner every day, and sometimes help out at their mother's store. I encourage the child to engage in activities they enjoy, to go out more and make friends, and to communicate with their parents more, understanding the importance of respecting elders. Parents should also respect the child, understand their inner thoughts, and meet their reasonable needs so that the parent-child relationship can develop positively.", "Consultation Record on 2020.10.31: Today, I conducted an effectiveness assessment with the child to address separation anxiety. By changing thought patterns and behavioral patterns, the client can genuinely understand and recognize themselves, be their true selves, express their real thoughts reasonably, accept themselves, enjoy themselves, maintain inner fulfillment, create a learning plan for themselves, and take action."], "experience_and_reflection": "Every child’s mental health journey is shaped by a unique confluence of genetic predispositions, family environment, and the interaction dynamics within the household. Reflecting on this case, I am reminded of how these elements interweave to impact a child’s emotional and psychological well-being. The girl’s experience underscores the significance of understanding these factors in depth to foster effective therapeutic interventions.\n\nFirstly, the genetic component cannot be overlooked. The girl's introverted nature and melancholic temperament appear to mirror her mother's personality traits. This suggests a potential genetic predisposition towards certain emotional tendencies. While genetics lay the groundwork, it is the family environment that often acts as the catalyst, either exacerbating or mitigating these inherent traits. The father's quick temper and high expectations have created an atmosphere of tension and pressure. Such an environment can significantly influence a child's perception of self-worth and competence. Children often internalize their parents' expectations, and when these expectations are accompanied by criticism, as was the case here, it can lead to feelings of inadequacy and despair.\n\nIn the context of family dynamics, the limited communication between the parents and the girl has further strained the relationship. This lack of open dialogue has led to misunderstandings and unresolved conflicts, contributing to the girl's feelings of isolation and hopelessness. It highlights the importance of fostering an environment where children feel safe to express their thoughts and emotions without fear of judgment. Encouraging open communication can help bridge the gap between parents and children, promoting a more harmonious and supportive family environment.\n\nThe girl’s strong identification with the character Lin Daiyu from \"Dream of the Red Chamber\" is another critical aspect to consider. This identification reflects her own struggles with expressing emotions and dealing with inner turmoil. It also suggests a coping mechanism, where she finds solace in literature and art. Encouraging these interests could be a constructive way to help her process her emotions and develop a stronger sense of self.\n\nThe family's reaction to the girl’s academic performance adds another layer to the complexity of the situation. The father’s focus on academic achievement as a measure of success and self-worth has placed immense pressure on the girl. This pressure, compounded by the transition from online learning during the pandemic, has led to a significant decline in her academic performance, further intensifying her feelings of failure and hopelessness. It is essential to address these academic expectations and help parents understand the detrimental effects of equating academic success with personal value.\n\nMoreover, the pandemic has played a crucial role in exacerbating the girl's mental health issues. The isolation and lack of social interaction during this period have deprived her of the support system she once had, leading to increased reliance on solitary activities like reading and crafting. These activities, while beneficial for introspection, have also isolated her further from potential social supports and opportunities for positive reinforcement from peers.\n\nThe intervention strategy focused on a multifaceted approach, addressing biological, psychological, and social aspects of the girl's life. The use of SSRIs and Mirtazapine was aimed at stabilizing her mood and mitigating symptoms of depression. However, medication alone is insufficient. Engaging the girl in cognitive restructuring and mindfulness practices was crucial in helping her recognize her intrinsic strengths and develop healthier thought patterns. These therapeutic techniques aimed to empower her, instilling a sense of agency and hope for the future.\n\nIncorporating family therapy into the intervention plan was pivotal. It was essential to address the dysfunctional family dynamics and promote healthier communication patterns. By involving the parents in therapy, the goal was to help them understand their daughter’s perspective and foster a more supportive home environment. Encouraging the parents to provide emotional support, rather than solely focusing on academic achievements, was a critical component of this process.\n\nReflecting on the case, it is evident that the girl's journey towards mental health recovery is ongoing. The progress she has made thus far is encouraging, but it also highlights the need for continued support and intervention. Her improved ability to express her thoughts and emotions is a positive outcome of the therapeutic process, but it is essential to ensure that these changes are sustained over time.\n\nThe insights gained from this case emphasize the importance of a holistic approach in psychotherapy. Understanding the interplay between genetic, environmental, and social factors is crucial in developing effective treatment plans. It also highlights the role of the therapist in creating a safe and supportive space for the client, where they can explore their thoughts and emotions without fear of judgment.\n\nIn conclusion, this case serves as a reminder of the complexities inherent in addressing mental health issues in children and adolescents. It underscores the importance of empathy, patience, and a comprehensive understanding of the various factors influencing a child's mental health. By fostering open communication, providing emotional support, and encouraging personal growth, we can help children like this girl navigate their mental health challenges and work towards a brighter future.", "causes": "Early upbringing environment (overprotective) and\npersonal personality factors", "symptoms": "Major depression", "treatment_process": "Gather basic information, build relationships, and set goals; Focused Solving and Motivational Interviewing: Motivation;  Cognitive-behavioral therapy: reconstructing cognition;\nmindfulness-based stress reduction, light therapy, and music therapy;\nFamily Systems Therapy: Adjusting family interaction and communication patterns.", "characteristics_of_illness": "The separation from the mother is not yet complete", "treatment_effect": "The client's mental state was significantly improved, negative emotions were effectively alleviated, and the family provided a\nsupportive environment for the client's recovery and growth."}
{"id": 46, "case_description": ["The girl sitting in front of me has just graduated from college, with a ponytail and watery eyes looking at me. She keeps calling me \"teacher,\" which reminds me of Guanjuer from \"Ode to Joy,\" who works hard overtime just to stay in the company.", "\"Teacher, I joined this company through campus recruitment last year. I heard from my colleagues that if newcomers do not get promoted in the first year at the Beijing headquarters, they might be transferred to branch offices elsewhere. I don't want to be transferred, but several people who joined the company at the same time as me have already been promoted and received salary increases, while I haven't been promoted in over a year. I've really worked hard, but why do I seem to fail more the harder I try?\""], "consultation_process": ["\"So, what do you think is the main reason that affects your chances of getting promoted?\" I asked Guan Ju'er.", "\"Well, teacher, I've actually thought about this issue too. Our company is a German enterprise, and everyone at the middle management level and above speaks English; knowing German is a bonus. Forget about German, I can't even manage English. In fact, I passed the English CET-6 in university, but as soon as I open my mouth, I get nervous, and when I'm nervous, I can't understand anything. Even when dealing with other colleagues, I feel anxious, worried that I'll be clumsy, say the wrong thing, or do something wrong, but the more I worry, the more mistakes I make.\"", "I picture Guanjuer in the company, smiling foolishly because she doesn't understand her German boss's instructions; no wonder she hasn't been promoted.", "\"What methods have you tried to address these factors? How effective were these methods?\"", "\"I stayed up late memorizing words, but I was actually very tired and couldn't remember anything. I try to communicate with my boss via email as much as possible. If I have to talk to him, I tell myself, 'I'm not nervous, I'm not nervous.' Also, I've noticed that I'm deliberately avoiding talking to my colleagues; I don't even want to talk to other Chinese people. When I encounter questions I don't understand, I don't dare to ask because I'm afraid of asking stupid questions and being laughed at. It seems these methods aren't very effective; I can't sleep well at night, and I make more mistakes at work during the day. Not talking to my boss isn't realistic either. Teacher, look, I've stayed up so late that I have dark circles under my eyes. What should I do, sob sob.\"", "Guan Ju'er propped her chin on her hands and made a particularly innocent expression. Yes, she made a \"woo woo woo\" sound like a cat. Nowadays, those born in the 90s use \"woo woo woo\" as a single word to express feeling wronged and helpless.", "At the stall where Guanju'er is being cute, I already have a rough idea in my mind. The strategy to help Guanju'er take the first step towards change is to face reality. \"Poor English\" is the reality in front of her, and in order to avoid the anxiety brought by facing this reality, Guanju'er has resorted to coping mechanisms such as \"staying up late to memorize vocabulary\" and \"deliberately avoiding speaking.\" Clearly, these strategies have not had a positive effect; instead, she has fallen into a vicious cycle of trying harder but failing more.", "\"Try not to speak, communicate via email.\" \"Deliberately avoid talking to colleagues.\" \"Even when faced with unclear questions, she doesn’t dare to ask.\" In terms of English, Guan Ju’er has become an ostrich with its head buried in the ground. The reason she avoids these situations and matters is that they bring her discomfort, insecurity, and anxiety. It can be said that this avoidance is her instinctive reaction, much like how a paramecium immediately dodges when a drop of salt is added to its culture medium; it is a form of seeking benefit and avoiding harm."], "experience_and_reflection": "Pursuing benefits and avoiding harm is a deeply ingrained human instinct, a survival mechanism that has served our species well throughout history. In the natural world, it is a strategy that ensures we steer clear of physical threats, navigate social complexities, and secure resources necessary for survival. Yet, this same instinct can become counterproductive when applied to our inner psychological landscapes, where avoidance often exacerbates issues like stress, depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. These mental challenges, rather than being external threats, are often internal experiences that demand acknowledgment and acceptance rather than avoidance.\n\nIn the real world, the principle of seeking benefits and avoiding harm can indeed be a practical and effective strategy. For instance, if one's neighborhood is unsafe, moving to a safer area—as illustrated by the story of Mencius' mother moving three times—can significantly improve one's living conditions. Similarly, individuals with severe allergies, such as peanut allergies, benefit from avoiding peanuts and foods containing peanut ingredients, thus protecting themselves from potentially fatal reactions. In these scenarios, avoidance serves a clear protective function, shielding individuals from harm and fostering well-being.\n\nHowever, when it comes to the inner world, avoidance can lead to a cycle of escalating distress. Consider the common emotional experience of heartbreak after a romantic breakup. This pain is a natural reaction, an inevitable part of the human experience. Yet, the phenomenon of \"seeing objects and thinking of people,\" a form of psychological generalization, can make avoidance impractical. I recall a friend who, after a breakup, found herself unable to ride the Beijing subway without feeling overwhelming sadness. The station names evoked memories of shared experiences with her ex-partner—dining at Korean hot pot at \"Wudaokou,\" shopping at \"Xizhimen,\" taking photos at the \"Zoo.\" These memories are unavoidable, as are the accompanying emotions, which arise spontaneously and uncontrollably. \n\nThe impossibility of avoiding these emotions is a testament to the complexity of the inner world. Emotions, unlike physical threats, cannot be sidestepped or ignored; they must be faced and processed. For my friend, the only solution was to coexist with her sorrow, allowing it to dissipate naturally over time, just as the haze in Beijing slowly clears. This process of coexistence, rather than avoidance, can facilitate emotional healing and growth.\n\nThe notion of control—often so effective in the external world—becomes futile when applied to internal experiences. Take, for example, a successful man whose wife succumbed to cancer. Despite his achievements and the control he exerted over his external circumstances, he found himself powerless against the internal experience of grief. He lamented, \"I hardly encountered any setbacks in the first half of my life—graduated from a prestigious university, had a solid background in a well-known company, and even started my own business smoothly. But why, at just over forty, does my wife have a terminal illness? My daughter is only nine years old. I'm so heartbroken; is there any way to not feel this sadness?\" The unfortunate truth is that there is no way to bypass such emotions. Life is replete with unsatisfactory moments, and internal experiences such as sadness and anxiety cannot be controlled or suppressed.\n\nMoreover, attempts to suppress or eliminate inner experiences often result in their intensification. This paradox is well illustrated by the classic example of \"don't think of the elephant.\" The very act of trying not to think about something makes it more likely to dominate one's thoughts. Similarly, Guan Ju'er’s mantra of \"I am not nervous, I am not nervous\" inadvertently heightens her anxiety. The more she tries to convince herself of her calmness, the more her nervousness escalates. This mirrors the experience of the grieving gentleman who repeatedly tells himself, \"I want to forget my wife, I want to forget my wife,\" only to find the memories of their shared moments growing more vivid in his mind.\n\nGuan Ju'er’s efforts to alleviate her anxiety by \"studying English until dawn\" are a tactical effort to mask her strategic avoidance. She employs avoidance strategies such as evading conversations with her boss and colleagues, protecting herself from discomfort. Yet, deep down, she recognizes that these strategies are akin to burying her head in the sand. Over time, this avoidance undermines her self-confidence, trapping her in a cycle of self-doubt and ineffectiveness. As she herself acknowledges, these strategies are not effective; only accepting reality can serve as the true foundation for meaningful progress.\n\nLife is filled with ineffective strategies that many people employ in a bid to cope with their challenges. Writing these strategies down on an A4 sheet of paper can be an illuminating exercise. Often, people metaphorically \"struggle\" by using this paper full of strategies to cover their faces, hiding from reality. This act of concealment occupies both hands, leaving them trembling and unable to engage with the world around them. \n\nImagine if, instead of hiding, you placed this paper on your lap, on the table, or tucked it away in a drawer. What possibilities might emerge if you ceased focusing on concealment and instead embraced visibility? For a university graduate like Guan Ju'er, who has already passed the English CET-6 exam, the decision to practice speaking confidently is truly just a small goal. By shifting her focus from avoidance to engagement, she can begin to build the skills necessary to advance in her career and foster a sense of self-assurance.\n\nThe difference between Guan Ju'er and her colleagues who have been promoted lies in their investment of energy. While others channel their efforts into constructing their realities, Guan Ju'er expends her energy on maintaining a fragile self-esteem, fighting a losing battle. This is why some people fail more the harder they try. Their efforts, rather than being directed toward growth and development, are consumed by the maintenance of an unsustainable facade.\n\nThrough Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), individuals like Guan Ju'er can learn to embrace their inner experiences rather than avoiding them. ACT emphasizes the importance of accepting emotions, thoughts, and sensations as they are, without judgment or resistance. By cultivating acceptance, individuals can begin to disentangle themselves from the cycle of avoidance and engage more fully with their lives.\n\nIn therapy, we explore strategies to shift the focus from avoidance to acceptance, encouraging clients to face their discomfort with openness and curiosity. This process involves recognizing the instinctual reactions that drive avoidance and consciously choosing to engage with reality. By doing so, clients can foster resilience, develop coping skills, and create meaningful connections with themselves and others.\n\nIn Guan Ju'er's case, the first step is to acknowledge her fear and anxiety surrounding her language proficiency and social interactions. By facing these emotions, she can begin to understand their roots and explore ways to build her confidence. Practicing English in a supportive environment, seeking feedback, and gradually increasing her exposure to conversational situations can help her develop the skills necessary to navigate her workplace effectively.\n\nFurthermore, Guan Ju'er can benefit from reframing her approach to challenges, viewing them as opportunities for growth rather than threats to her self-esteem. By embracing discomfort and uncertainty, she can cultivate a sense of courage and empowerment, allowing her to move forward with confidence.\n\nUltimately, the journey toward acceptance and engagement is a deeply personal one, requiring patience, perseverance, and self-compassion. As Guan Ju'er navigates this path, she can learn to embrace her inner experiences, transforming them into sources of strength and resilience. Through this process, she can build a foundation for meaningful effort, allowing her to achieve her goals and thrive in both her personal and professional life.", "causes": "Social factors (work stress) and personal personality factors", "symptoms": "Anxiety and decreased sleep quality", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection and relationship building;\nAcceptance and Commitment Therapy: Shift from\navoidance to acceptance of emotions and actively adopt strategies to solve problems.", "characteristics_of_illness": "It embodies the nature of human beings to seek\nadvantages and avoid disadvantages", "treatment_effect": "The client's negative emotions were relieved, his true goals and action  strategies were clarified, and he was full of confidence and courage for future development and work."}

For instance, many people die in traffic accidents every day; these people don’t know they will die when they leave in the morning! But don’t people still go out every morning?  \nClient: Yes! Worrying is useless; when it’s time to die, just die; when it’s not time to die, there’s no need to worry!  \nConsultant: Hmm! Yes.  \nSilence  \nClient: You say this, and I feel like my symptoms are really not that serious. If I don’t say anything, no one knows. When I’m at work, wearing a police uniform and holding a baton, really no one knows what’s inside me. My illness is something I express. Compared to those patients in your clinic, I’m not even considered ill (the client once brought a family member to the clinic and saw that most patients were in severe anxiety states with somatization symptoms).  \nConsultant: Yes!  \nSilence  \nClient: I understand (the client shows a bright, relieved smile). It seems like the heart I’ve kept inside for so many years suddenly can breathe!  \nConsultant: Oh! Tell me more?  \nClient: I feel I don’t need to consult anymore; I should just go do what I need to do!  \nConsultant: Hmm~ Yes! Just do what you need to do directly!  \nClient: So, I really won’t come for consultations anymore!?  \nConsultant: That’s what you say; are you really planning to do it?  \nClient: Yes, since I can’t rely on anyone, I have to face it myself.  \nConsultant: How do you plan to face it?  \nClient: Do what I need to do!  \nConsultant: No more making excuses with symptoms?  \nClient: It’s useless to talk about it! There’s no meaning; just do what I need to do!  \nConsultant: Hmm~ That’s up to you!  \nClient: Okay. Then I’ll end my consultation here.  \nConsultant: Okay!  \nClient's wife: You should still do a few more consultations, let Teacher Li guide you.  \nClient: No need; since I can’t rely on anyone, I have to face it bit by bit myself. I know how to do it! Continuing consultations would be meaningless!  \nConsultant: You can completely take charge yourself!  \nClient: Then I won’t consult anymore; I’ll treat you to a meal later!  \nConsultant: Hmm! Good. I’ll be waiting!"], "experience_and_reflection": "Feelings after the session: Reflecting on these pivotal sessions, I am drawn into the intricate tapestry of the client's journey—a journey that is emblematic of the struggle between dependency and autonomy, a universal human conflict. The sessions primarily utilized psychodynamic methods, which allowed us to delve into the depths of the client's psyche. This approach is particularly suited to clients who are, like this individual, entangled in their symptoms. These symptoms are more than mere manifestations of anxiety; they are the physical embodiment of an internal conflict that has festered over time, providing both a refuge from responsibility and a barrier to personal growth.\n\nThe client's state of dependency is not merely a behavioral pattern but a psychological position deeply rooted in their early life experiences. From our discussions, it became evident that this dependency was fostered by an upbringing that possibly lacked the necessary support for fostering autonomy. The client's parents, although likely well-intentioned, may have unwittingly reinforced a childlike dependence, which the client now struggles to overcome. In many ways, the client remains tethered to a past that is comfortable yet stifling, yearning for the freedom of adulthood but feeling ill-equipped to claim it.\n\nThe choice of a short-term psychodynamic approach was deliberate. While a classical psychoanalytic framework might provide a rich, in-depth exploration of these dynamics, it demands a significant investment of time and resources. Given the client's immediate needs and the nature of their entanglement, a more focused approach was necessary. In the eighth session, we reached a critical juncture where the client began to recognize their state of dependency. This realization was not just intellectual but also emotional, marking a shift in the client's self-perception. The act of journaling became a symbolic gesture, a tangible manifestation of the client's burgeoning desire to take charge of their life.\n\nHowever, recognizing a state of dependency is only the first step. The client's dependency mentality, deeply ingrained over years, could not be eradicated overnight. The ninth session thus aimed to not only dispel this mentality but also to ignite a sense of agency within the client. Initially, the client engaged in a familiar dance, employing defensive tactics by focusing on symptoms. It was crucial to resist being drawn into this narrative. Previous therapeutic attempts, such as hypnosis and desensitization therapy, had failed precisely because they inadvertently reinforced the client's subconscious trap—relying on external interventions rather than fostering internal growth.\n\nBy directly addressing the psychological dynamics behind the symptoms, we moved towards a breakthrough. The client began to see the dual nature of their symptoms: while they offered certain benefits, they simultaneously prevented a fulfilling life. This realization was profound, as it laid bare the client's internal conflict—a desire for growth juxtaposed against a reluctance to relinquish the safety net of dependency. The client's life was marked by this tension, a push-pull between the comfort of childhood and the allure of adult freedoms.\n\nIn exploring this tension, it became apparent that the client faced two viable paths. They could either fully embrace their childlike state, accepting the responsibilities that came with adulthood, or they could step into adulthood, assuming the accompanying freedoms and responsibilities. The challenge lay in the client's inability to commit fully to either path, resulting in a state of paralysis.\n\nThe therapeutic process revealed itself as a dance of transference and countertransference. The client viewed me as a figure of dependence, a substitute for the parental figures in their life. Conversely, I found myself in the role of being depended upon, a dynamic that required careful navigation. My task was to facilitate the client's realization that growth is their responsibility, a journey that they alone must undertake. By dismantling their reliance on the therapist, I hoped to inspire a self-motivated pursuit of growth.\n\nThe session employed provocative interventions, challenging the client to confront their fears directly. Questions such as “Will you die doing that?” served to jolt the client out of their complacency, encouraging them to consider the irrationality of their fears. This approach, though direct, was grounded in empathy and aimed to rekindle the client's capacity for action. The realization that their symptoms were not as burdensome as they appeared was a turning point. The client began to perceive themselves as empowered, a sentiment captured in their description of their work persona—\"Wearing a police uniform, holding a baton,\" evoking an image of authority and self-assurance.\n\nThis newfound strength, once experienced, began to take root. It was as if the client had finally found solid ground beneath their feet, enabling them to take tentative steps towards autonomy. The therapeutic journey had not only equipped the client with insights but also instilled a sense of self-efficacy that would continue to flourish in their life.\n\nThe reflection on this case has deepened my appreciation for the complexities inherent in the therapeutic process. It underscores the delicate balance between providing support and fostering independence, a balance that is at the heart of effective psychotherapy. This client's journey is a testament to the transformative power of therapy, illustrating how, through understanding and courage, one can transcend the shackles of dependency and embrace the possibilities of growth and freedom.", "causes": "Social factors (work stress) and personal personality factors", "symptoms": "Dependence, inner conflict, and somatization symptoms", "treatment_process": "Basic information collection and relationship building;\nHumanistic Therapy: Listening, Empathy, and Acceptance; Surface quality technology: directly point out the problem;\nShort-term psychodynamics: Exploring the root cause behind the problem.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Stagnation of psychological development due to\nunresolved internal conflicts", "treatment_effect": "The client's negative emotions were relieved, the fear in his heart was broken, the confidence and courage to live and work\nindependently, and the autonomy and initiative were regained."}
{"id": 48, "case_description": ["Xiao Li, a new transfer student in the sixth grade of elementary school, has poor grades. With the help of her neighbor Xiao Xia, she gets to know a male classmate named Xiao Xiao from the next class. They engage in activities such as passing notes, making phone calls, and giving gifts, which makes their parents anxious and sparks discussions among classmates, leading to a \"romantic\" uproar."], "consultation_process": ["1. Did she \"fall in love\"? One morning, after my third class, I passed by Class 6(2), and the homeroom teacher, Ms. Wang, hurriedly called me over and said, \"Teacher Xia, wait a minute, I need to discuss something with you!\" \"What's the matter? You look so anxious!\" I stopped. She pulled me aside, looked around to make sure no one was listening, and lowered her voice to say, \"It's serious! Your student Xiao Li (pseudonym) is dating our student Xiao Xiao (pseudonym)! Last night, Xiao Xiao's mom called me, and she was extremely anxious.\" I was a bit surprised. Although it's possible for sixth graders to have crushes given that children develop early these days, Xiao Li is such a shy girl! I had taught her math in third and fourth grade; her grades were average, and she was quite introverted and quiet. Last year, she was sick and missed half a year of school, and this semester she was re-enrolled in sixth grade, just coincidentally in my class. At the beginning of the term, she was still very shy; she would blush when the teacher asked her questions. How could she be in a relationship? I quickly asked Ms. Wang, \"Could there be a mistake? Is it a misunderstanding?\" \"How could it be a misunderstanding? Xiao Li even gave Xiao Xiao a bottle of lucky stars, a full 100 of them! It was discovered by Xiao Xiao's mom, and Xiao Xiao herself admitted it. Some girls in our class said that Xiao Li even cried because Xiao Xiao liked another girl! Students are already talking about it. You are their psychological counselor and also Xiao Li's assistant homeroom teacher, so it's better for you to handle this matter. You must stop them!\" Ms. Wang became more serious. I then realized the \"seriousness\" of the issue and said to Ms. Wang, \"Alright, the key issue is Xiao Li. I'll talk to her properly, but you mustn't let this leak out.\" Ms. Wang sighed in relief and said, \"Okay, I'll leave it to you!\" I decided to have a good talk with Xiao Li.\n\n2. Someone is \"playing matchmaker.\" During the third period of class, I told Xiao Li's homeroom teacher, Ms. Shen (who is also my co-teacher), that I wanted to talk to Xiao Li. After getting her permission, I took Xiao Li to the school’s psychological counseling room—\"The Little House of Hearts.\" After she sat down, I poured her a glass of water and asked with concern, \"Xiao Li, how are you adjusting to our class this semester? Are you finding it okay?\" \"Pretty good, the classmates are all nice to me, and I especially like the psychological counseling activities,\" she said with a shy smile. It seems she is adapting well to her new class and has a good relationship with her classmates. So, I got straight to the point: \"I heard that you have a crush on Xiao Xiao from the next class, is that right?\" Her face turned even redder, and she nodded shyly. To ease her worries and understand the situation better, I said kindly, \"Actually, it's very normal for someone your age to have a crush on a boy. Can you tell me how you two got to know each other?\" Xiao Li started to think. After a moment, she quietly said, \"I didn't know him at first; I was just neighbors and good friends with Xiao Xia (pseudonym) from their class. One day, Xiao Xia pointed at Xiao Xiao who was shooting hoops and said to me, 'What do you think of our Xiao Xiao?' I said he's pretty good. She said she would help introduce us, but I didn't agree. A few days later, Xiao Xia mysteriously gave me a note that said: 'Hello! I'm Xiao Xiao from Class 6(2), I love sports. Can we be friends?' I thought he was very enthusiastic and sincere, so I replied: 'Hello, I'm Xiao Li, I love handicrafts and would be very happy to be friends with you.'\" And so, with Xiao Xia's \"help,\" they started \"dating\" by passing notes to each other.\n\n3. Coming out of the fog. After listening to her, I tentatively asked, \"You and Xiao Xiao's relationship has already attracted classmates' gossip and parents' worries; are you aware of that?\" \"I've heard about it,\" she said, looking down, seemingly aware of the situation. \"So how do you think it will go on like this? What do you think about your classmates' gossip and your parents' and teachers' worries?\" \"I'm quite troubled. On one hand, I think continuing this relationship might affect our studies and lead to others' gossip, but on the other hand, I can't help but think about him. Teacher Xia, what do you think I should do?\" She looked at me with hopeful eyes. I felt her helplessness and anxiety. I said, \"First of all, I think you're very smart to realize that continuing this relationship might affect your studies and cause gossip, which is not good for either of you. Secondly, I feel you are someone who values emotions a lot and cherishes the friendship between you two. In fact, the sincere friendship between boys and girls is very precious, and reasonable interactions benefit both parties' personal growth and development.\" I tried to avoid labeling her as \"dating.\" She seemed to ponder this and nodded silently. I continued, \"However, the way you are interacting now—secretly passing notes and giving gifts—easily leads to misunderstandings and gossip from others.\" She nodded vigorously. \"Your current school life is like climbing a mountain, with the summit being your goal. You're halfway up the mountain, and you see a beautiful flower-filled mountain opposite you, and you want to pick some, but that means you have to go down and climb another mountain, which will take a lot of time and effort. Until you reach your destination, some beautiful scenery is only meant to be appreciated.\" \"I know, but...\" she hesitated. I understood what she wanted to say and continued, \"You can treasure this beautiful feeling and enrich yourself through a fulfilling study life and sports activities. One day, when you both grow up and if you still feel good about each other, it won't be too late to become closer!\" I felt it was necessary as a teacher to give some advice to the students. She seemed to understand and said, \"Thank you, Teacher Xia. I know what to do now. But please, don't tell my dad and mom about this.\" I solemnly assured her, \"I will definitely keep it a secret!\" We ended the conversation happily. Since our talk, I have been paying more attention to Xiao Li than before. I noticed she seemed more spirited in class and was more willing to raise her hand to answer questions, and her interactions with her male classmates increased. I felt a bit \"reassured.\"\n\n4. A new \"storm.\" Two weeks later, one night around nine, Ms. Wang called me, sounding heavy-hearted, and said, \"Teacher Xia, something happened again. Xiao Li called Xiao Xiao again, and it was discovered by Xiao Xiao's mom. Xiao Xiao's mom called Xiao Li's house, questioning Xiao Li's mom about why she didn't discipline her daughter. After Xiao Li's mom learned of this, she felt very ashamed and seemed to blame the school for keeping it a secret. Tomorrow, they are all coming to school to clarify the matter and want all three kids (Xiao Li, Xiao Xiao, and Xiao Xia) to be present. They also asked me to notify Xiao Xia's mom. I called you this late to give you a heads-up.\" I didn't expect things would turn out this way, so I told Ms. Wang, \"Thank you for telling me this. Confidentiality is one of the principles we uphold as counselors. Tomorrow, I will explain it reasonably to them. Since this matter is no longer a secret, we should also have Xiao Li's homeroom teacher present. Let's see how it goes tomorrow!\" On the phone, Ms. Wang also informed me that Xiao Xiao's parents had divorced when he was in kindergarten, and he lived solely with his mother. I worried that if the parents said something inappropriate tomorrow, it could make the three children feel even more uncomfortable.\n\n5. Meeting the parents. The next day was Saturday, and the school only had two interest classes in the morning. At 10:30, after sending off the other students, Xiao Li, Xiao Xiao, and Xiao Xia stayed behind. Sitting in the classroom of Class 6(2), they all looked heavy-hearted. Shortly, Xiao Li's parents, Xiao Xiao's mom, and Xiao Xia's mom arrived, along with Ms. Wang, Xiao Xiao's homeroom teacher, and Ms. Shen, Xiao Li's homeroom teacher. I suggested letting the kids step outside, but both Xiao Xiao's and Xiao Xia's moms insisted they should \"participate throughout.\" I briefly explained the situation and shared my views on adolescent interactions between the sexes. Xiao Li, Xiao Xiao, and Xiao Xia listened quietly. At this point, Xiao Xiao's mom excitedly narrated her family situation, expressing that she did not want her son to experience this so early and implied some blame towards Xiao Li for being \"too emotional\" and Xiao Xia for being \"too meddlesome.\" To avoid unnecessary emotional harm to the kids, I signaled for them to go home, which the parents agreed to. After they left, Xiao Li's dad said, \"Actually, the teachers have handled this matter quite well. It was inappropriate for us to come to school today to reprimand the kids and trouble the teachers; I feel embarrassed.\" Xiao Xia's mom said to Xiao Xiao's mom, \"Actually, their relationship isn't as terrible as you think; just pay a little more attention in the future.\" Both homeroom teachers also commented on the children's behavior at school and discussed how to guide the education of adolescents. In the end, I added that this matter shouldn't be made public or pursued further; just focus on having individual communication and guidance with your children.\n\n6. Group counseling intervention. The incident involving Xiao Li and Xiao Xiao had affected not only the involved parents but also the students in two sixth-grade classes. Therefore, it was appropriate to conduct psychological counseling or lectures on adolescence for the students. Thus, I coordinated with relevant teachers to combine our class with Class 6(2) and conducted a psychological counseling activity on adolescent interactions in the school's multimedia classroom. The class used PPT software to present adolescent stories while interspersing hot topics for student discussions, followed by the teacher providing guiding suggestions and insights. Although the two classes (a total of 91 students) attended together, the effect was quite good; the students were focused and engaged in enthusiastic discussions. I used the same method to conduct activity classes for the other two sixth-grade classes, and the outcomes were also very positive. Afterwards, I seized the opportunity to give a lecture on hygiene and self-protection for all the sixth-grade girls, which was also well-received.\n\n7. A rainbow after the rain. Afterward, I had another conversation with both Xiao Li and Xiao Xiao. From our discussions, I learned that they both had developed a relatively \"rational\" understanding of the situation. Nearly a year had passed, and everything had returned to normal. As the end of elementary school approached, Xiao Li became more lively and cheerful, often playing jump rope with her classmates and asking male classmates about their studies during breaks. Xiao Xiao continued to play basketball outside of class and was able to speak up boldly in class, which made me feel gratified. Now, they have both graduated from elementary school, and I sincerely wish them the best in every step of their journey in life."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on the journey of Xiao Li and the interactions that unfolded within the sixth-grade environment, I am struck by the delicate balance we must maintain as educators and counselors when navigating the complexities of early adolescent relationships. This case serves as a profound reminder of the multifaceted nature of childhood development, especially as children approach puberty—a time characterized by both physiological and psychological transformations.\n\nAs sixth graders begin to enter puberty, they naturally develop an interest in the opposite sex. This curiosity is often coupled with a sense of shyness and uncertainty as they become increasingly aware of themselves and their peers. In working with Xiao Li, it became clear that our role as educators and counselors is not merely to address specific incidents but to foster a supportive environment where students can explore their identities and emotions safely and constructively.\n\nXiao Li's situation was unique in that she was not only dealing with the typical challenges of adolescence but also the added complexity of repeating a grade due to illness. This meant entering a new learning environment where she felt isolated and vulnerable. Her neighbor Xiao Xia, through her playful yet somewhat misguided attempt to bridge a connection between Xiao Li and Xiao Xiao, inadvertently set the stage for what became a significant learning experience for all involved.\n\nFrom a clinical perspective, the interaction between Xiao Li and Xiao Xiao can be viewed through several psychological lenses. One significant aspect is the role of peer influence in shaping adolescent behavior. Xiao Xia's involvement in facilitating the relationship highlights how peers can act as catalysts in the exploration of social and emotional boundaries. This peer-mediated introduction may have provided Xiao Li with a sense of belonging and acceptance, something she desperately needed given her recent transitions and the social isolation she felt.\n\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which underpinned my approach in this case, offers valuable insights into understanding and addressing the thoughts and behaviors associated with adolescent relationships. In Xiao Li's case, it was essential to explore her cognitive processes regarding her feelings for Xiao Xiao and her understanding of the situation. Through CBT, I aimed to help Xiao Li recognize the automatic thoughts and beliefs she held about herself and her relationships, enabling her to gain a more balanced perspective.\n\nEmpathy played a crucial role in building a therapeutic alliance with Xiao Li. By acknowledging her feelings and validating her experiences, I was able to create a safe space for her to express herself. This approach helped Xiao Li feel understood and supported, which is critical for adolescents who often struggle with feelings of being misunderstood by adults. It was important to avoid dismissing her feelings as mere childish infatuation, as doing so could have alienated her and hindered her ability to process her emotions healthily.\n\nAnother critical aspect of the intervention was the use of metaphor and storytelling, which are powerful tools in CBT. By likening Xiao Li's school life to a mountain-climbing journey, I could help her visualize the importance of focusing on her goals while appreciating the beauty around her without getting sidetracked. This metaphor served to reinforce the idea of prioritizing her studies and personal growth while recognizing that the feelings she experienced were a natural part of her developmental journey.\n\nThe involvement of parents in this case was both a challenge and an opportunity. Xiao Xiao's mother's reaction, driven by her own family dynamics and concerns about her son's early exposure to romantic relationships, highlighted the need for parental guidance and education. Through group counseling sessions, I sought to address these concerns by facilitating open communication between the parents and their children. It was essential to help parents understand the developmental stages of adolescence and the importance of guiding their children with empathy and understanding rather than through fear or reprimand.\n\nFurthermore, this case underscored the importance of addressing the broader school community. The incident involving Xiao Li and Xiao Xiao had repercussions that extended beyond the individuals directly involved. By conducting group counseling and educational sessions for the sixth-grade students, we were able to address misconceptions and promote healthy interactions between the sexes. These sessions provided a platform for students to engage in discussions about boundaries, respect, and mutual understanding, equipping them with the skills necessary to navigate their social worlds.\n\nThe collaboration with homeroom teachers and other school staff was instrumental in ensuring a cohesive approach to managing the situation. By working together, we were able to create a supportive network that reinforced the lessons learned during counseling sessions and educational activities. This collaborative effort was crucial in creating an environment where students felt safe to express themselves and seek guidance when needed.\n\nReflecting on the outcomes of this case, I am encouraged by the growth and development observed in both Xiao Li and Xiao Xiao. Nearly a year after the initial incident, both students had developed a more rational understanding of their relationship and its implications. Xiao Li, in particular, showed remarkable resilience and adaptability. Her increased confidence in class and willingness to engage with her peers were testament to her personal growth and the effectiveness of the interventions implemented.\n\nThe insights gained from this case have reinforced my commitment to ongoing professional development as a school psychological counselor. Understanding the nuances of adolescent development and the impact of early relationships on a child's psychological well-being is critical. As counselors, we must strive to equip ourselves with the knowledge and skills necessary to support our students through their formative years.\n\nIn conclusion, this case has taught me the importance of adopting a holistic approach when addressing the challenges of adolescent development. By considering the interplay of individual, peer, familial, and educational factors, we can provide more effective support and guidance to our students. As we continue to navigate the complexities of adolescence, let us remain committed to fostering environments where young people can thrive and grow into healthy, well-adjusted adults.", "causes": "Developmental characteristics and personal personality factors", "symptoms": "calf love", "treatment_process": "Cognitive-behavioral therapy: awareness of automated thoughts and adjustment of cognition;\nHumanistic Therapy: Empathy, Acceptance;\nMetaphor and storytelling: Compare your academic  progress to the path of climbing a mountain, and inspire thinking.", "characteristics_of_illness": "A common phenomenon of puberty", "treatment_effect": "The client became aware of his own automatism, dispelled his confusion, and was guided by a counselor to choose to continue his studies and keep an appropriate distance from the opposite sex."}

Formulation of the Consultation Plan", "The consultation process is divided into three stages:", "The first stage is the psychological assessment and diagnosis phase, establishing the counseling relationship, collecting information, conducting psychological diagnosis, and determining counseling goals.", "The second phase is the consultation phase, which first helps the seeker analyze and solve problems, changing their irrational cognition and maladaptive emotions and behaviors.", "The third stage is the consolidation and termination phase, which helps the seeker apply what they have learned in counseling to their future life, continually improving their personality and enhancing their mental health.", "(2) Main Consultation Methods and Applicable Principles:", "1. Main consultation methods and principles used: Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy, relaxation training.", "Rational Emotive Therapy is a form of cognitive therapy that was founded by the famous American psychologist Albert Ellis in the 1950s. Because it incorporates some methods of behavioral therapy, it is also known as Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy. This approach aims to change the irrational beliefs of those seeking help through pure rational analysis and logical reasoning, in order to assist them in resolving emotional and behavioral issues. The theory emphasizes that the source of emotions lies in an individual's thoughts and beliefs, and that individuals can change their emotions by altering these factors. It posits that it is not the events themselves that cause sadness and distress, but rather the incorrect interpretations and evaluations of those events. Events are inherently neutral; however, when people assign their own preferences, desires, and evaluations to them, various so-called troubles and disturbances may arise.", "The core theory of Rational Emotive Therapy (RET) is the ABC model. In the ABC model, A refers to the activating event; B refers to the beliefs that individuals have in response to the activating event, which include their views, interpretations, and evaluations of that event; and C refers to the emotional responses and behavioral outcomes that occur in specific situations. Generally, people believe that emotional and behavioral responses are caused by the activating event A, meaning that A leads to C. However, the ABC theory indicates that the activating event A is only an indirect cause of emotional and behavioral responses, while the beliefs, views, and understandings B that individuals hold about the activating event are the more direct causes of their emotional and behavioral responses. Therefore, individuals can eliminate corresponding emotional distress by changing their erroneous beliefs. The Socratic method is the most distinctive technique of Rational Emotive Therapy. It originates from the dialectics of the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates, known as the \"Socratic method\" of debate. First, the seeker expresses an irrational viewpoint, then the therapist further reasons based on that viewpoint, ultimately revealing the fallacies, thereby helping the seeker recognize the irrational aspects of their previous thoughts and actively correct them.", "Relaxation training is a form of behavioral therapy that involves learning to relax both mentally and physically through a structured training program. Its core theory posits that the psychological changes induced by relaxation serve as a counterforce to the psychological changes caused by stress. Relaxation can inhibit anxiety and has a good anti-stress effect.", "2. The responsibilities, rights, and obligations of both parties:", "Respect the help seeker, adhere to the scheduled appointment time, and inform the help seeker in advance if there are special circumstances.", "The counselor will provide a printed copy of the responsibilities, rights, and obligations of both parties to Han and their guardian, informing the seeker that they can raise any questions at any time. The general content of the rights and obligations of Han's guardian includes: the right to voluntarily choose and change the counselor; the right to be informed, negotiate, and choose; adherence to negotiation principles and confidentiality principles; and compliance with the contract, among others.", "3. Consultation time and fees: to be discussed.", "7. Consultation process:", "The consultation process can be roughly divided into three stages:", "1. Psychological diagnosis phase", "2. Psychological Support Phase", "3.

The counselor provides timely affirmation and encouragement for the progress of the help-seeker.", "(4) Behavioral relaxation training: Under the guidance of a counselor, practice progressive muscle relaxation training. For example, sit on a chair and tense then relax the muscles in the order of the arms, head, torso, and legs. By understanding the differences between tension and relaxation, one can ultimately experience a state of full-body relaxation. Whenever tension arises, think about relaxing and achieve psychological relaxation through the physical act of relaxing the muscles.", "(5) Assign consultation tasks: Encourage clients to debate with their irrational beliefs, learn to create RET self-help worksheets, and use the Socratic method to challenge these negative cognitions.

This will help better adapt to real life and promote overall physical and mental health and development.", "(4) Conduct psychological testing: The help-seeker independently completes the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), receives feedback on the assessment results, and concludes the consultation.", "8. Evaluation of Consultation Effectiveness", "Through observation and follow-up, it was found that the help-seeker's consultation had basically achieved the expected goals, with some unreasonable cognitive patterns having been fundamentally changed and replaced by new, rational ones. Negative emotions related to anxiety were largely eliminated, leading to a more rational understanding of setbacks and failures, while also enhancing the ability to cope with academic pressure, allowing for peaceful sleep. The psychological issues faced by the help-seeker were alleviated, and all indicators from psychological assessments were within the normal range. Throughout the consultation process, the help-seeker was able to open up and established a high level of trust with the counselor. At the end of the consultation, the help-seeker wore a smile and appeared relaxed. The consultation was effective."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on Han's case, the therapeutic journey underscored the multifaceted nature of exam anxiety and the critical role of personalized intervention strategies. Initially, Han presented with a constellation of symptoms, including difficulty sleeping, decreased appetite, and an inability to concentrate, all stemming from her heightened anxiety related to academic performance. These manifestations were deeply intertwined with her cognitive framework, which was heavily influenced by her upbringing and the high expectations placed upon her by both her parents and herself. The pressure to excel academically was not only external but had been internalized, creating a cycle of stress and anxiety exacerbated by her perfectionist tendencies.\n\nIn approaching Han's case, establishing a strong therapeutic alliance was pivotal. This involved not only gaining her trust but also ensuring that her parents, who were integral to her support system, were engaged and supportive of the therapeutic process. The success of this initial phase was largely attributable to the use of unconditional positive regard and empathy, which facilitated open communication and a safe environment for Han to express her fears and anxieties.\n\nThe application of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) was central to our strategy. By employing the ABC model, we were able to dissect the activating events (A) that triggered Han's anxiety, such as exams, and identify the irrational beliefs (B) that fueled her emotional and behavioral responses (C). Han's belief that she must perform perfectly in every exam and her fear of disappointing her parents were core irrational beliefs that needed addressing. Through Socratic questioning, we challenged these beliefs, encouraging Han to critically examine and reframe them into more rational alternatives. This cognitive restructuring was instrumental in reducing the intensity of her emotional responses and fostering a more balanced perspective on academic performance.\n\nIn conjunction with cognitive interventions, relaxation training played a crucial role in managing Han's physiological symptoms of anxiety. Techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation and deep breathing exercises were introduced to help Han attain a state of physical calm, which in turn alleviated her psychological distress. These methods were not only effective in the therapeutic setting but were also skills that Han could employ independently to manage stress in real-time situations, such as during exams.\n\nThe therapeutic process also involved a comprehensive analysis of Han's personal growth history and family dynamics. Her upbringing in a high-achieving family environment, where mistakes were met with severe punishment, contributed significantly to her fear of failure and the development of perfectionistic traits. This understanding was crucial for both Han and her parents, as it highlighted the impact of their educational approach and opened pathways for more supportive and nurturing interactions.\n\nA significant aspect of Han's therapy was addressing her introverted personality and strong competitiveness, which, while contributing to her academic success, also heightened her susceptibility to anxiety. Encouraging Han to adopt a more flexible and compassionate view of herself allowed her to appreciate her efforts without the constant pressure of achieving flawless results. This shift was essential in promoting self-acceptance and reducing self-imposed stress.\n\nThroughout the sessions, the integration of feedback from Han's teachers and parents provided a holistic view of her social functioning and academic performance. Their observations corroborated the insights gained during therapy and reinforced the need for a collaborative approach. By involving her support network, we were able to create a more conducive environment for Han's personal and academic growth.\n\nThe evaluation of the consultation's effectiveness revealed significant improvements in Han's psychological well-being. The reduction of her Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) scores indicated a substantial decrease in anxiety levels, aligning with the observed changes in her emotional and cognitive patterns. Han's ability to sleep peacefully and her enhanced concentration in class were tangible outcomes of the therapeutic interventions.\n\nReflecting on the overall process, the case highlighted the importance of tailored therapeutic strategies that address both cognitive and behavioral aspects of anxiety. Han's intelligence and insight were leveraged to facilitate her engagement with the therapeutic concepts, allowing her to take an active role in her healing journey. The collaboration with her parents further underscored the necessity of involving family members in the therapeutic process, especially in cases where family dynamics play a critical role in the individual's psychological issues.\n\nIn conclusion, Han's case not only demonstrated the efficacy of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy combined with relaxation techniques but also emphasized the need for a comprehensive approach that considers the individual's background, personality traits, and social environment. The experience reinforced the value of empathy, patience, and adaptability in psychotherapy, as each case presents unique challenges and opportunities for growth. The successful resolution of Han's exam anxiety serves as a testament to the power of well-structured therapeutic interventions in transforming negative cognitive patterns and promoting mental health resilience.", "causes": "Physiological factors, negative life events, and personal personality traits", "symptoms": "Mild test anxiety and decreased sleep quality", "treatment_process": "basic information gathering and relationship building;\nPsychological assessment and development of plans and goals;\nRational Emotion Therapy: Reconstructing Perceptions of Exams and Self;\nrelaxation training;\nPositive Autosuggestion: Consolidating the effect.", "characteristics_of_illness": "A common phenomenon", "treatment_effect": "The client's anxiety was alleviated and eliminated, the irrational\ncognitive pattern was changed, and the resilience and self-confidence were improved."}

If there’s a spot that isn’t relaxed enough, you can move it a bit. Hmm, your teeth are still clenched. Is it habitual? Is your neck relaxed now? After your neck relaxes, I will touch your head; the neck is very soft, you can imagine your head is a watermelon and your neck is the vine!

It could be the ocean, the grasslands, or the forest, or maybe in your cozy blanket at home? \n\nExperiencer: The grasslands. \n\nCounselor: Would you like to run on the grasslands? Or lie on the warm grass? \n\nExperiencer: Lie on the warm grass. \n\nCounselor: Such warm grass, very thick! Soft, like a blanket. And you can smell the freshness of the grass. When you smell that scent, your body will relax even more. Then you will feel warm, with sunlight shining on your face. But you can’t see it, it’s too dazzling, yet there’s a warm feeling. Your exposed face and hands feel the warm rays of sunlight. The grass is very soft and warm. And you can feel the warmth from your back. You can imagine your two hands, like holding two boiled eggs. At first, your palms are warm, and gradually your whole palms warm up. Slowly, your whole hands warm up.

It all happens naturally. \n\nCounselor: Do you feel any discomfort in the elevator? \n\nExperiencer: No. \n\nCounselor: Imagine you’re in a very beautiful elevator, and it’s slowly descending. I will count down from ten to one. When I reach one, describe to me what your favorite, pleasant scene looks like. You can also describe the grasslands. Ten, the elevator is descending. The chair is descending, and you are descending. You will feel sleepier, but you can clearly hear my voice.

Experience the relaxation of your breath, experience the pleasant feeling in your body. Once more, take a deep breath, and when you breathe, don’t tense your body, just breathe out very comfortably! Earlier, we talked about when I count to one, can you describe to me the environment that makes you happy, pleasant, and feels safest? \n\nExperiencer: A sea of flowers. \n\nCounselor: Tell me, what color are the flowers? \n\nExperiencer: Yellow. \n\nCounselor: Very rich, right?

Is your body warm now? \n\nExperiencer: Hmm. It’s pretty good. \n\nCounselor: How about your hands? Are they warm? \n\nExperiencer: My hands are still a bit cold. \n\nCounselor: Good, continue to feel that sunlight. If you find a safe place or a happy, solid place in it. Would you look for a room? \n\nExperiencer: No. \n\nCounselor: You’d rather stay in this nature, very good! Stand in this nature for a while, you can also try sitting for a while. \n\nExperiencer: I see a lounge chair. \n\nCounselor: What does that chair look like? \n\nExperiencer: That chair is flat, with no backrest. \n\nCounselor: What material is that flat chair made of? Is it wood? \n\nExperiencer: It’s made of wood. \n\nCounselor: What color? Is it raw wood? \n\nExperiencer: It’s raw wood. \n\nCounselor: The feel of raw wood is closer to nature. Now you can quietly lie down. Feel the different sensations of the chair. Then, smell what scent there is now? Has the refreshing scent of the wind come? Because you are outdoors, it feels very refreshing, right? \n\nExperiencer: Hmm. \n\nCounselor: In the future, every time you enter a hypnotic state, stay in this place for a while first. When you leave hypnosis, also come here to stay for a while before leaving. Would you like to do that? Stay here for a while before coming in and after going out. Now, I want to help you, you trust me very much, right? You lie here as if you are lying on that chair. Let yourself feel and recall. Where do you feel your feelings and conflicts? When they arise, where do you feel chest tightness or discomfort? The feelings of panic you had when doing hypnosis before. Now you can try to see if you can approach that feeling. Is the dizziness a general dizziness or a localized one? Is it in your forehead or on the top of your head? \n\nExperiencer: There’s a feeling of panic. \n\nCounselor: Panic, because the heart is beating fast, it’s okay, I will help you. Are there any other uncomfortable feelings? Recall from your childhood until now. When did similar feelings occur? Dizziness, the heart beating very fast. It seems like it could jump out. You can think about what the earliest similar memory you have is. It could be middle school? It might also be elementary school or kindergarten? It doesn’t matter. It’s like you’re starting to search your whole life for similar feelings; can you remember when they occurred? \n\nExperiencer: In elementary school. \n\nCounselor: Hmm, in elementary school. Being scolded or punished by the teacher. Did you feel dizzy then? Just the feeling of panic was very obvious, right? What grade were you in elementary school? Can you remember being punished by the teacher? Can you remember if the teacher was male or female? What did they look like? Can you describe them to me simply? \n\nExperiencer: A round face. \n\nCounselor: That should be very kind, right? Very strict, isn’t it? Did they talk like a machine gun? When they were teaching you, what grade were you in? \n\nExperiencer: (Crying) \n\nCounselor: Seeing this teacher makes you a bit unhappy, it’s okay, I will help you! Seeing the teacher punishing you makes you a bit sad, it’s okay, cry it out. That teacher was lecturing you, and at that time you felt very helpless. What grade was it? Can you see her expression, her demeanor? \n\nCounselor: It’s okay, I will help you, just cry it out, you can cry! Crying is a brave expression. We face her, and just cry it out. You see, it’s been over 20 years since elementary school, and after crying, she won’t hide in the gas tank of your heart anymore, she will be released. When you feel you can talk to me, just tell me. What grade were you in? \n\nExperiencer: It was always this teacher in elementary school. Especially in the lower grades. The teacher taught me for six years. \n\nCounselor: That’s really not easy, six years, right? This teacher spoke strictly, not only to you but also to others. In the end, did you feel a bit afraid when you saw her? \n\nExperiencer: Yes, my heart was racing. \n\nCounselor: Now try to go back to elementary school, I’ll help you, it’s okay. It doesn’t really affect her. Let this teacher stand in front of you, her round face facing you, blah blah blah. Now that you’re grown up, you’re no longer that little girl. What would you like to say to her? Use the second person and tell her what you want to say. Do you know you have a big impact on me? Would you dare to say that to her? \n\nExperiencer: I wouldn’t dare. \n\nCounselor: Do you know you have a big impact on me? \n\nExperiencer: I still feel a bit scared seeing her now. \n\nCounselor: You can say it to her now! What is this teacher's last name? \n\nExperiencer: Sheng. \n\nCounselor: Teacher Sheng, I feel scared seeing you now, tell her. \n\nExperiencer: Teacher Sheng, I feel scared seeing you now, why do you treat me this way? Not just me, but also other classmates. \n\nCounselor: Here, you can question her why she did this? Ask her loudly. Why? Why? Why? How dare you treat me this way? Why do you treat me like this? How can you be a teacher like this? Use the most vicious words you can remember and say them to her without any impact. Because she’s not really in front of you. It’s beneficial for you. I don’t know how to say it in the worst way. How dare you treat me this way? Alright, does it feel better to say it out loud? Also, little one, you’re already grown up now, you’re around 30, right? Help that little you. What’s that little one’s name? \n\nExperiencer: San Zhe Er. \n\nCounselor: Go help San Zhe Er. It’s okay, everything has passed. The teacher has aged, and we have grown up. Tell her this, she will feel better! What hairstyle does San Zhe Er have? \n\nExperiencer: A ponytail. \n\nCounselor: Is it a round face or an oval face? \n\nExperiencer: Round face. \n\nCounselor: Quite cute, can you feel that she feels scared facing the strict teacher? You can also go over and hug her. \n\nExperiencer: I feel like I’m shaking. \n\nCounselor: Is it you now or the little one who is shaking? \n\nExperiencer: It’s me now who is shaking. \n\nCounselor: It’s okay. When you were little, was that third party scared? Can you see the teacher now? What expression do you see on the teacher’s face? Is there guilt? She hasn’t realized it, right? You’re 30 years old now, and she has become a thing of the past. Can you let her go? Now you still need to try to bring out that little third party. It’s very simple because you were very small at that time and the family took care of you very well, and your reaction to such things would be very strong! Not independent, right? The family took care of everything. Now you’re grown up, you’re over 30 years old. If you were to meet that teacher again, would you have such a reaction now? \n\nCounselor: No. \n\nExperiencer: Why not? \n\nCounselor: It’s because you’ve grown up now, right? You’ve gained wisdom, you have the ability, right? Your life experiences are richer, right? Does the grown-up San Zhe Er want to go back and help that younger San Zhe Er? Yes, to experience that again. Why did the teacher act that way? Because she has problems, right? She might have quarreled with her husband. Or she has personality issues. How old was the teacher then? \n\nExperiencer: In her thirties. \n\nCounselor: She also had a family and children, right? \n\nExperiencer: Yes. \n\nCounselor: Now analyze it with the mindset of the 30-year-old San Zhe Er. Actually, she’s not easy either. But she left you with a shadow. See if you can help that San Zhe Er. It’s been so many years now. Give that San Zhe Er some comfort, hug her, and comfort her. See if her expression is still a bit scared, nervous, right? You can hug her, kiss her face. Take her to that grassland. Change the place and have a good time. Chase her and play happily. Let her vent and breathe out all the unpleasantness. Once more, once more. Do you feel better? Are you still shaking? Does the third party still have any hatred towards the teacher? \n\nExperiencer: No. \n\nCounselor: Now make the teacher small and put her far away. These are all past events; she should stay in the years gone by. Now the teacher is in front of you, how big is she? How big is the image? Make it smaller, can it be further away? Do you feel more comfortable shifting it to the right or left? Left or up and down? \n\nExperiencer: Move it to the left a bit further away. \n\nCounselor: Is it better? Move it further away. Is your mood a bit better today? Tell me. Is your mood very calm now? \n\nExperiencer: Yes. \n\nCounselor: Is your body still shaking? Is your heart very calm now? Come, relax yourself. Go to that grassland. Relax from head to toe, relax your head, relax your body. Are your hands still that cold? Do you still feel cold? I want to touch you, try it out. Let me touch your left hand. What does it feel like? \n\nExperiencer: It feels warm. \n\nCounselor: That warm feeling spreads throughout your body. Expand it from your palms to your body! Do you feel more comfortable? Keep that feeling and relax. Go back to that grassland? Or lie in the sea of flowers for a while. Which would you like to choose? \n\nExperiencer: The sea of flowers. \n\nCounselor: The sun is shining bright, the sky is azure. You can run there and show a joyful expression. Are you standing there now? Or lying there? Or running? \n\nExperiencer: Running. \n\nCounselor: Running very easily. Now feel your heart, is it very comfortable there? \n\nExperiencer: Showing a joyful expression. \n\nCounselor: When you’re running, what are you wearing? \n\nExperiencer: Green. \n\nCounselor: Are you happy? Very joyful, right? Is your body still shaking? Run a bit, jump a bit. Run and jump. When you’re tired from running, you can lie on the edge of the sea of flowers, sprawled out, completely relaxed. From the inside out, your body will feel a great improvement. Take two deep breaths. Breathe out the last bit of frustration and unhappiness. Adjust your body. Look again at that teacher, who has become so small; blow her away. Now that you’ve become strong, do you still care about her? Is your body comfortable? You will feel even more comfortable after waking up. In the future, when you do hypnosis and relaxation, you will be able to quickly return to this environment. If I ask you to recall the colors of the sea of flowers now, what color do you remember the most? \n\nExperiencer: Yellow. \n\nCounselor: In the future, whenever you want to feel relaxed and happy, just think of yellow. Your mood will instantly brighten. You can save yourself, mediate for yourself, and isn’t that a great achievement? In the future, just think of this yellow, and you will return to the same pleasant mood as now. I’m also very curious, what kind of yellow is it exactly? \n\nExperiencer: Tender, very fresh yellow. \n\nCounselor: In the future, whenever you imagine a sea of yellow, your mood will be very joyful. This yellow is your cue after hypnosis. Remember this yellow, and your mood will improve. \n\nAwakening: 1. Move your feet; 2. Move your ankles; 3. Rotate your waist; 4. Move your shoulders and arms, you can clench your fists to gain strength; count to 5, and open your eyes happily."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on the case of hypnosis for addressing emotional stress, it is evident that this session provides a rich tapestry of clinical insights and challenges. Hypnosis, particularly in a therapeutic setting, requires a nuanced understanding of both the technique and the psychological landscape of the individual. This session provided an opportunity to delve deeply into the experiencer's emotional responses and past traumas, using hypnosis as a medium to explore and heal.\n\nThe initial precautions for online hypnosis highlight the importance of establishing a controlled environment. Emphasizing the need for clear communication and an interruption-free setting underscores the critical role of environmental stability in achieving effective hypnosis. The suggestion that the client will naturally wake from hypnosis if technical issues arise serves as a safeguard, reinforcing the client's autonomy and safety. These precautions are fundamental, as they set the stage for a successful session by minimizing external disruptions, allowing the client to fully engage with the hypnotic process.\n\nThe session's structure was meticulously designed to guide the experiencer through a journey of relaxation and emotional exploration. The counselor's use of sensory imagery—describing the experiencer's head as a watermelon on a vine, or their body resting on soft grass—served to deepen the relaxation and promote a vivid sensory experience. Such imagery is not arbitrary; it leverages the power of visualization to foster a sense of safety and comfort, essential for accessing deeper emotional layers.\n\nThe session skillfully transitioned from physical relaxation to emotional exploration, gradually introducing elements of the experiencer's past that were linked to current feelings of anxiety. This transition is a critical aspect of therapeutic hypnosis, where the aim is to connect the body's relaxed state with the mind's readiness to confront and process buried emotions. The imagery of a sea of flowers and the presence of small windmills provided a safe and tranquil backdrop against which these emotions could be explored.\n\nOne of the session's pivotal moments was the exploration of the experiencer's childhood memories, specifically those related to interactions with a strict teacher. This segment illustrates the therapeutic potential of hypnosis to uncover and address deep-seated emotional wounds. By guiding the experiencer to recall these memories and express feelings that were previously suppressed, the session enabled a cathartic release. The counselor's encouragement to question the teacher and articulate pent-up emotions is a therapeutic technique aimed at reclaiming agency and altering the emotional impact of past experiences.\n\nThe counselor's empathetic approach, acknowledging the experiencer's tears and providing reassurance, is vital in creating a supportive environment. The act of crying during the session is recognized as a brave expression, a step towards healing. The counselor's invitation to view the teacher's actions through the lens of adult understanding—considering her potential personal struggles—fosters a more nuanced perspective. This shift from victimization to understanding can be transformative, allowing the experiencer to reframe their narrative and release residual resentment.\n\nFurthermore, the session's conclusion, with its focus on anchoring positive emotional states through sensory cues—such as the color yellow—demonstrates an advanced understanding of post-hypnotic suggestions. These cues serve as tools for the experiencer to access feelings of relaxation and joy independently, promoting long-term emotional resilience. This technique highlights the session's goal not only to address immediate stress but to equip the experiencer with strategies for ongoing self-regulation and emotional well-being.\n\nThe experiencer's journey through the hypnotic session reveals the intricate interplay between past experiences and present emotional states. The session underscores the importance of exploring these connections within a safe and supportive therapeutic framework. The counselor's role as a guide and facilitator is crucial, providing both structure and flexibility to adapt to the experiencer's evolving needs throughout the session.\n\nReflecting on the experiential outcomes, it is clear that hypnosis can be a powerful tool for emotional healing. However, its effectiveness hinges on the counselor's ability to create a trusting therapeutic alliance, navigate the client's emotional landscape with sensitivity, and employ techniques that resonate with the individual's unique experiences. This session exemplifies how hypnosis, when executed with care and expertise, can foster profound personal insights and emotional release, paving the way for growth and healing.\n\nIn future sessions, the integration of feedback from the experiencer can enhance the therapeutic process. Understanding the client's perspective on what aspects of the hypnosis were most effective or challenging can inform adjustments to techniques and approaches. Additionally, ongoing training in the latest developments in hypnotherapy can enrich the counselor's practice, ensuring that sessions remain dynamic and responsive to the client's evolving therapeutic needs.\n\nThe insights gained from this case highlight the transformative potential of hypnosis in addressing emotional stress. By facilitating a safe space for emotional exploration and offering tools for self-regulation, hypnosis can empower individuals to navigate their emotional landscapes with greater confidence and resilience. As practitioners, our commitment to continual learning and adaptation in our techniques will ensure that we provide the most effective support for our clients' journeys toward healing and personal growth.", "causes": "Traumatic childhood experiences", "symptoms": "Anxiety, stress", "treatment_process": "basic information gathering and relationship building;\nHumanistic Therapy: Empathy, Acceptance, and Listening;\nBody relaxation, hypnotherapy, and positive suggestion.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Early traumatic experiences are not addressed promptly", "treatment_effect": "The client's anxiety and stress are released, a new perspective on childhood traumatic events is gained, the teacher who is punishing the punishment is understood and forgiven.

{"id": 101, "case_description": ["Basic Information: Xiaoxin, 35 years old, company administrative staff. Xiaoxin and her husband are college classmates and have been together for over a decade, with a lovely 5-year-old baby. However, due to an accident, Xiaoxin suspects that her husband may be cheating, leading to constant feelings of suspicion and distrust towards him, which has caused a significant crisis in their marriage.", "Chief complaint: Hello, teacher. I feel like I've been experiencing some symptoms of depression lately. This started about six months ago. My husband and I were college classmates and have been together for over ten years. Our baby is now five years old. We've always been very affectionate, and even now, he likes to take me along whenever he has social events.", "In March of this year, his business was not doing very well, so I introduced him to Mr. Sun, a neighbor in our community who does business abroad, because I am quite familiar with Mr. Sun's wife, and we often play with our babies together! After they met, I felt that Mr. Sun was a really nice person; he doesn't smoke or drink, and since my husband enjoys drinking, they got along quite well. This way, Mr. Sun can invite my husband to hang out with friends, and I feel comfortable with them driving together.", "However, I never expected that during the month of March, Mr. Sun turned out to be a man who really enjoyed visiting those romantic places. It was also during this time that my husband got to know a KTV hostess. They met on March 2nd, and by April 9th, I discovered that they had been in contact via phone calls and text messages. After that, my husband never contacted her again. He told me that they only made phone calls and chatted, and nothing else happened. He said the woman liked him and often called him, and he didn't refuse her. Men, perhaps, often don't know how to say no.", "Because my husband basically has no friends of the opposite sex, and I'm the kind of girl who is very sensitive about this. So on the night of April 9th, I caught him texting that girl at home. Later, when I checked the call log, I found that they had been exchanging messages every day for a month, and there were also several phone calls. I was about to break down. I even slapped my husband; he had always told me that he was just chatting out of curiosity about their lives. Later, I tested the waters in various ways and felt that they really didn't have much going on. By the end of August, I stopped bringing it up!", "Until the beginning of this month, Mr. Sun went online and chatted with my husband, mentioning what happened on the night of the 2nd, which was the day my husband met that woman. He said that my husband and that woman stayed together until 4 a.m. and mentioned that he lived next door to them. (Mr. Sun didn't know much about my husband before; he later found out that my husband is quite a flirt, loves to boast, and plays around.) I was completely taken aback because I remembered my husband came home around 4 a.m. that night. I even called him at 1 a.m., and he said they had just finished singing and were having some late-night snacks outside. I didn't think much of it since they were together, so I didn't ask any further and went to sleep. I still regret it now; I don't know why I was so relaxed that night. Usually, I would constantly call him to urge him to come home, but that morning I woke up, and it was already morning. So now I keep thinking that my husband must have slept with that woman that night. I've asked him many times; I said Mr. Sun mentioned it, yet you still won't admit it. He just told me, \"You've been with me for so many years; don't you know what kind of person I am? I absolutely did not have any relations with that woman. You'd rather believe outsiders than trust your husband, and I have nothing more to say.\" I feel like I really have some psychological issues now; every time I ask him, it's always the same response, saying that it has been a long time since the incident. He acknowledges that it's wrong to stay in contact with someone behind my back. After I found out, he said he stopped all contact and that he takes me along whenever he goes out, whether for business trips or social events, just to reassure me. He said, \"No matter how you feel, it's been so long; can we stop bringing this up? You keep asking about this and that; it will only make someone rebellious.\" He insists that it didn't happen! I pointed out that people have detailed accounts with the right time and place, but my husband just said that if I choose to believe him, there's nothing he can do. In any case, he insists he had nothing to do with that woman! He only repeats that if I don't believe my husband and choose to believe outsiders, there's nothing he can do!", "I often suffer from insomnia now, my mind constantly wondering if they slept together that night, but I dare not ask him, knowing he would definitely give me the same answer. I can't bring myself to ask anything, and I can't muster the energy to do anything. I feel like there's a huge stone weighing down my heart all day long! It's really frustrating. In fact, I wish I could just let it go, but it's been so long. I can only blame myself for being careless; if I had urged him to come back a little earlier that day, nothing would have happened! I resolved to stop overthinking, and friends and relatives around me are all speaking up for him, even my own sister says my brother-in-law is not that kind of person, and I believe him! My good friends also say that no matter who cheats, they don’t believe my husband would! What should I do? I feel like I'm almost having a mental breakdown! I still want to investigate further; deep down, I believe my husband wouldn’t do that, and his attitude suggests the same. If there was something between them, would they really say they weren’t in contact anymore? But Mr. Sun spoke so convincingly that I can't help but think it might be true! Living in this constant suspicion every day is really exhausting and frustrating!"], "consultation_process": ["Psychological Counselor: From your narrative, I can sense that you are currently feeling angry, irritable, anxious, sad, disappointed, and regretful. You and your husband are college classmates, and over the years, you have gone through many ups and downs together, supporting each other with deep affection, and you have a lovely 5-year-old baby. Who would have thought that because of you, your husband got to know your neighbor, which has led to his current infidelity? Since the incident occurred, you have been feeling very regretful.", "You are immersed in deep regret, yet you overlook the fact that your original intention in introducing your husband to your neighbor was good. As for what happened afterward, no one could have predicted it, right? It has been half a year since the incident occurred, and you and your husband have argued and fought, but what has been the result? Your husband still does not admit it, does he? I want to ask how your marital relationship is now. Is it very different from more than half a year ago? If this continues, do you think your relationship with your husband will get worse? The reason you care so much about whether your husband has had relationships with other women is that you have deep love and concern for him. But if you keep insisting on arguing with him about this issue, won't it push him further away? Is that the outcome you ultimately want?", "In fact, you have two choices in front of you: First, choose to trust him, rebuild a mutually trusting and secure relationship, and start a new life. Second, continue to repeatedly question your husband about something that has already objectively existed six months ago and that you cannot change, which will only torment him and push him further away from you, ultimately leading to mutual blame, misunderstanding, resentment, and possibly separation. Is this the outcome you desire? Please consider carefully, take care, and wish you success."], "experience_and_reflection": "Client: Teacher, thank you very much for your analysis! Yes, if the objective facts that already exist are really as he said, that nothing has happened and it is just my imagination, then pressuring him every day would make him feel very wronged! If something did happen, it is already a fact, and we cannot go back or change it!\n\nReflecting on this case, I realize that Xiaoxin's situation is not uncommon among couples who have been together for a long time. Trust, once compromised, becomes a fragile thread that can easily unravel if not carefully nurtured. Her experience highlights the profound impact that suspicion and uncertainty can have on a marital relationship. The case also underscores the importance of communication and transparency between partners. It's evident that Xiaoxin's internal conflict stems from a deep-seated fear of betrayal, which is a common emotional response when trust is called into question. This fear can often lead to behaviors that are counterproductive to the relationship, such as incessant questioning and monitoring, which only serve to widen the gap between partners.\n\nXiaoxin: I feel that our relationship is still the same as before; he treats me just like he always has. However, I always have a knot in my heart. Sometimes when I watch TV, I encounter similar situations, and I end up using words to mock him. In our daily life, he takes me everywhere he goes. When he has time, he takes me and the baby to the supermarket and the park! Actually, if I hadn't discovered their text messages that time, I might not feel that he has changed now! He always says, \"Why do you want me to admit to things I didn't do? You're insulting my character! There should be trust between spouses! You have to believe me!\" From his words, I feel that he hasn't done anything wrong to me! But when I chat with Mr. Sun using his QQ account, I feel that Mr. Sun's words imply that he has something going on with another woman! Right now, I really feel like I can't bear this psychological pressure any longer!\n\nAs a clinician, I recognize the importance of addressing the root causes of Xiaoxin's insecurity. Her tendency to mock her husband during moments of doubt may be a defense mechanism, a way to express her inner turmoil without directly confronting the pain of mistrust. It's crucial for Xiaoxin to understand that these behaviors, while seemingly minor, can erode the foundation of her marriage over time. It is through open dialogue and a willingness to be vulnerable that she can begin to rebuild the trust that has been damaged.\n\nPsychological Counselor: Is your relationship with your husband really the same as it used to be? The reason you are suffering so much now is precisely because you have lost the most basic trust in him, isn't it? Yes, perhaps he is still treating you the same way as always, but if you continue to be endlessly entangled in this matter over time, do you think your husband will change his attitude towards you? In fact, I can sense that you love your husband very much and care about him, which is why you are so concerned about this issue. Since you love him so deeply, why not choose to trust him? Why do you care so much about what an outsider says?\n\nThis inquiry is pivotal. Trust is not simply a passive state but an active choice that must be made repeatedly. Encouraging Xiaoxin to consciously choose trust over suspicion is an essential part of her healing process. It's also important to explore why she places so much weight on the opinions of others, like Mr. Sun. Perhaps this is indicative of a deeper issue related to self-esteem and the need for external validation. By addressing these underlying concerns, Xiaoxin can start to cultivate a sense of security from within, reducing her reliance on external affirmations.\n\nClient: Yes, teacher, you are absolutely right. I choose to trust him and don't want to regret our originally good relationship when it has worn out. Yes, why should we believe an outsider's words to hurt each other? You are really right! Thank you! Today we talked again, and I clearly remember that my husband said how great it would be for our family of three to be happy together. It's been such a long time, and I admit that it was wrong to contact her, but I said I would stop contacting her, and I really will!\n\nAt this point, Xiaoxin is beginning to embrace the idea of rebuilding trust. However, recognizing the need for change is just the first step. It is vital to equip her with strategies to manage her suspicions effectively. Cognitive-behavioral techniques can be beneficial in helping her reframe negative thoughts and challenge the assumptions that fuel her mistrust. Additionally, mindfulness practices can assist in grounding her emotions, allowing her to remain present rather than dwelling on past anxieties or future uncertainties.\n\nBut I would like to ask the teacher how I can rebuild trust again. I am inherently a suspicious woman, and after this incident, whenever his phone rings, I instinctively want to know who it is and what’s going on. I often check his QQ chat history for no reason, even though I know there’s nothing there. Am I being pathological now? I feel very confused; I understand all the reasoning, but I just can’t fully let it go. It’s really frustrating! Recently, I often wake up in the middle of the night, and when my mind starts to wander, there’s a voice inside reminding me not to overthink it. I promised myself not to bring it up or think about it anymore, as if there are two versions of myself fighting against each other!\n\nThis internal conflict is a common experience for individuals grappling with trust issues. Xiaoxin's awareness of her behavior and its impact on her well-being is a positive sign, indicating her readiness for change. It is crucial to normalize her experience, acknowledging that these feelings are valid yet do not have to define her actions. Developing a structured plan to address these concerns, such as setting boundaries around phone checking and establishing open communication channels with her husband, can provide a sense of control and empowerment.\n\nPsychological counselor: When your husband's phone rings, you instinctively want to know who it is and what the matter is. You often look at his QQ chat history without any reason. This behavior is because you subconsciously worry that your husband might emotionally drift away again. You want to hold on to him, but does this behavior pattern really lead to your husband's understanding and recognition? Perhaps it only has a counterproductive effect? You say you are inherently suspicious; what experiences have made your personality so insecure and so doubtful? You always excessively worry that your husband might cheat again. Why do you lack confidence in yourself? Perhaps only by understanding these issues can you gain clarity and feel a sense of freedom!\n\nExploring Xiaoxin's past experiences can provide valuable insights into her current behavior. Often, patterns of mistrust and insecurity are rooted in earlier relational experiences, whether in her family of origin or previous relationships. Unpacking these experiences in therapy can help Xiaoxin recognize how they influence her present interactions and empower her to make conscious choices that align with her values and desires for her marriage.\n\nClient: Thank you for your guidance, teacher. I will work hard!\n\nAs we conclude this reflection, it is important to emphasize the ongoing nature of Xiaoxin's journey. Rebuilding trust is not a linear process but a dynamic one that requires patience, commitment, and self-compassion. By fostering a deeper understanding of herself and her relationship, Xiaoxin can move towards a more secure and fulfilling partnership with her husband. The therapeutic alliance will continue to support her as she navigates this challenging yet transformative journey, providing a safe space for exploration, growth, and healing.", "causes": "Crisis of trust in the couple's relationship due to the husband's suspected cheating incident.", "symptoms": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety disorder", "treatment_process": "Listening and empathy: relationship building;\n Cognitive-behavioral therapy: changing absolutist irrational beliefs\n Positive thinking therapy: focusing on the present moment", "characteristics_of_illness": "Obsessive-compulsive and anxiety symptoms triggered by her husband's infidelity.", "treatment_effect": "Through cognitive-behavioral therapy, identify the irrational beliefs of the visitor, i.e., the obsession to find out the evidence of her husband's infidelity, so as to reorganize her goal of rebuilding a good relationship with her husband.

After that, the child became taciturn, staying alone in his room after returning home, and the frequency of conversations with his parents decreased. The discovery of him playing games happened after a parent-teacher meeting, when he was called to the office by the homeroom teacher. The teacher pointed to the child's exam results and said, \"The child's grades are very poor; his classmates say he goes to internet cafes to play games after school.\" The parents, who were not usually very patient, returned home and began to interrogate the child. The child timidly replied, \"I've been playing on the computer for three months, and since then I've become obsessed with games.\" His grades started to decline, and by the first semester of the second year, his results were very poor, ranking near the bottom.", "Since middle school, I have been addicted to the internet; I feel uncomfortable without it, dislike studying, and have skipped over 50 classes.

Growing up in such an environment, the child has not been able to form a good attachment relationship with the mother, lacking a sense of security and the needs for love and belonging being unmet.", "3. Being overly concerned about children's academic performance. Parents adopt very strict parenting styles from a young age, combined with simple and harsh physical punishment and verbal abuse. They fail to praise and encourage the child when academic performance is good, but criticize, complain, and resort to punishment when performance is poor. This prevents the child from developing a positive self-concept from an early age and does not reinforce a healthy interest in learning.", "Due to a lack of security, the need for love and belonging is not met, which leads to wrapping oneself up, becoming particularly introverted and insecure.

Social reasons: Currently, society generally lacks sufficient understanding of teenagers' internet use, often believing that children become addicted as soon as they go online and worrying that they will learn bad habits. This anxiety itself leads parents to provide insufficient guidance on the proper use of the internet, reinforcing the awareness of internet addiction in children, which in turn makes them more obsessed with the internet. At the same time, the regulation of teenagers' internet use by society needs to be strengthened.", "Root of the problem:", "1. Incorrect family education: Parents lack scientific and effective concepts and methods of parenting, only pursuing their children's academic performance in a one-sided manner. When grades decline, they resort to simple and crude educational methods. Children become addicted to the internet, and many of the reasons stem from the parents' actions. Most parents are busy with work and are only satisfied with meeting the basic needs of their children, such as \"being fed, clothed, warm, and having some pocket money,\" without understanding what their children's inner needs are. As a result, children cannot find true understanding from their parents and turn to the internet for it, chatting, cursing, and expressing themselves freely under pseudonyms.", "2. Poor personality: In addition to family factors leading to a sense of emptiness, a child's poor personality is also an important reason for easy addiction. Observations have found that children who are prone to internet addiction often exhibit negative personality traits, such as being lonely and introverted, and unwilling to interact with others. When they encounter psychological conflicts or distress that they cannot resolve, they turn to the internet to vent, as they find that the internet is a good outlet: they have control over the keyboard, can look at whatever they want, and chat about anything with online friends, fulfilling their desires. Soon, they become infatuated with the internet.", "3. Environmental Impact: In today's rapidly advancing information technology era, the internet is no longer a strange term. From young children just starting school to retired seniors, everyone can navigate computers with ease. Internet cafes are ubiquitous, and the quality of online content varies greatly.

Pressure of Learning: Under the premise of quality education, the entrance examinations for high school and university still primarily focus on scores.

Every parent should have full confidence in their child in order to build harmonious family relationships.", "2. Do not hold high expectations and blame the child. Being overly strict with your child can undermine their self-confidence and often has the opposite effect. For introverted and competitive children, it may also lead to compulsive tendencies. It is important to prevent children from becoming disheartened after setbacks in real life, as they may develop a tendency to escape from reality and become addicted to the internet.", "3. In life, it is important to provide appropriate encouragement and praise to children. During their growth, suitable encouragement promotes their development. Children's interest lies in exploring the world; the more they struggle with something, the more they want to try it, and once they master it, they often lose interest. Children are objects of nurturing; they should not be treated as pets, nor should their rights be taken away. Recognize all of the efforts children make, appreciate the small progress they achieve, and even learn to value their failures, allowing children to feel that their parents are their support. Timely praise affirms their achievements at each stage. This way, we can cultivate children's self-confidence and inspire their pursuit of future realities.", "4. Cultivate a wide range of interests and hobbies in children. Increase their curiosity about the outside world, thereby diverting their singular interest in the internet. Do not simply oppose children's use of computers, as computers have unique advantages as tools for learning and living in today's society and should not be absolutely banned. Completely prohibiting children from using computers is unrealistic and may lead to rebellious feelings, resulting in counterproductive outcomes.", "5. Parents, schools, and society should participate together. Parents and teachers need to enhance their understanding of the internet; they should neither allow children to use the internet excessively under the guise of \"broadening their horizons\" until it leads to addiction nor excessively control their internet access out of fear of online dangers, as this may drive them to illegal internet cafes in society, which would be counterproductive. This is a crucial aspect of preventing internet addiction. Parents and teachers should provide correct guidance and reasonable supervision, not only directly controlling the time teenagers spend online at home and at school but also improving their ability to use the internet wisely. From a psychological perspective, we offer the following suggestions, hoping parents can guide their children to have a proper understanding of the internet: (1) Cultivate children's self-control ability (2) Enter into children's inner world (3) Broaden children's interests and hobbies (4) Create a good family environment for children (5) Encourage more guidance and less restriction on children's internet use. Schools should conduct education on internet use for students, enhance monitoring of online activities and internet access locations on campus, and enrich campus life, which will undoubtedly reduce the occurrence of internet addiction.", "6. Pay attention to the mental health of adolescents: This stage is when children are most prone to internet addiction, as they are going through puberty and a rebellious phase, making them psychologically unstable and easily attracted to the colorful online world. Therefore, parents should give special attention to children in this developmental stage, listen more to their thoughts, carefully observe their changes, and provide necessary support and psychological guidance in a timely manner, using the warmth of the family to draw them away from the internet."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflections on Experience\n\nThe phenomenon of internet addiction among adolescents, especially middle school students, is not merely a behavioral issue but a multifaceted psychological and social challenge that requires a comprehensive approach. Over time, as I reflect more deeply on this case, it becomes increasingly clear that the roots of such addiction are entrenched in various elements that intersect with the developmental, familial, educational, and societal dynamics surrounding the youth.\n\nAt its core, internet addiction in adolescents like the young boy in this case often stems from unmet psychological needs. Adolescents are in a phase of life marked by significant psychological and emotional changes. They are developing their identities, seeking acceptance, and striving for independence. When these needs are not adequately met in their immediate environment—be it home, school, or social circles—they may turn to the virtual world, where they can create an alternate identity, find acceptance, and exercise a sense of control that they might not experience in the real world.\n\nIn this particular case, the boy's home environment was less than nurturing. The lack of a secure attachment with his mother and a family atmosphere characterized by frequent conflicts and impatience contributed significantly to his emotional turmoil. Such an environment does not only foster insecurity but also stifles the development of a healthy self-concept. Adolescents need a safe space to express themselves and explore their thoughts without fear of harsh judgment or punishment. The boy's resort to the internet can be seen as an escape, a place where he felt a sense of belonging and validation that was missing at home.\n\nThe punitive and authoritarian parenting style observed in this family further exacerbated the boy's condition. It is crucial for parents to understand that while discipline is necessary, it should be balanced with empathy and understanding. Children need to be encouraged and praised for their efforts, not just outcomes. The boy's experience of being criticized and punished for poor academic performance, without any recognition of his efforts or positive reinforcement when he did perform well, likely led to a diminished self-worth and an aversion to academic pursuits.\n\nThe educational environment also played a significant role. The pressure of exam-oriented education, which emphasizes grades over learning and understanding, can lead to immense stress and anxiety in students. In this case, the boy's academic decline was met with criticism rather than support, pushing him further into the virtual world where he felt competent and valued. Schools need to adopt a more holistic approach to education, one that considers students' emotional and psychological well-being alongside their academic achievements. Providing a supportive environment where students feel valued and understood can mitigate the allure of escaping into the virtual realm.\n\nThe societal context is another important factor. There is often a lack of understanding about internet use among adolescents. Parents and educators may fear the dangers of the internet and, in their attempts to control it, might inadvertently push children towards it. A more informed approach would involve guiding children on the responsible use of the internet, highlighting its benefits while also making them aware of its pitfalls. Society, at large, needs to develop a balanced view that neither demonizes technology nor ignores its potential.\n\nThe internet, while a source of addiction for some, is also an integral part of modern life and can be a powerful tool for learning and development when used appropriately. Encouraging adolescents to explore their interests and engage in a variety of activities can reduce their dependency on the internet. In this case, fostering a wide range of hobbies and interests in the boy could have provided him with alternative avenues for self-expression and fulfillment.\n\nFurthermore, addressing internet addiction requires a coordinated effort involving parents, educators, and mental health professionals. Each has a role to play in creating an environment that supports healthy development. Mental health professionals can provide valuable insights into the psychological needs of adolescents and offer strategies to help them navigate this challenging phase of life.\n\nFrom a clinical perspective, it is essential to recognize the signs of internet addiction early and intervene with empathy and understanding. Therapy should focus not only on reducing internet use but also on addressing the underlying psychological needs and emotional distress that drive such behavior. Building a therapeutic alliance with the adolescent, involving them in the treatment process, and empowering them to take charge of their well-being are crucial elements of successful intervention.\n\nIn this case, family therapy was instrumental in bringing to light the dynamics that contributed to the boy's addiction. It provided a platform for the family to communicate openly, understand each other's perspectives, and work towards rebuilding trust and connection. The process helped the parents recognize the impact of their behavior on their son and prompted them to adopt more nurturing and supportive parenting practices.\n\nAs I continue to reflect on this case, I am reminded of the importance of a compassionate and holistic approach to adolescent mental health.

The case underscores the necessity of a multifaceted therapeutic approach, employing techniques such as person-centered therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and relaxation training to address the nuanced challenges faced by adolescents like Wang.\n\nFrom the onset, it was clear that Wang's introverted and sensitive personality, combined with her high aspirations and familial expectations, contributed significantly to her anxiety. Her longing for acceptance and recognition among peers, juxtaposed with her perceived inadequacies in academic performance and social interactions, created a fertile ground for psychological distress. This case serves as a poignant reminder of the pressures that high-achieving environments can exert on young individuals, particularly those transitioning into adolescence.\n\nOne of the primary insights gained from this case is the importance of addressing cognitive distortions that exacerbate feelings of inadequacy and anxiety. Wang's tendency to interpret peers' attention negatively and her belief that her self-worth was contingent upon others' evaluations are classic examples of cognitive errors that require careful intervention. By employing cognitive therapy techniques, we were able to guide Wang in challenging these distortions, helping her to develop a more balanced and realistic perception of her social interactions and self-worth. This process not only alleviated her anxiety but also empowered her to engage more confidently with her peers.\n\nFurthermore, the role of person-centered therapy in fostering a supportive therapeutic environment cannot be overstated. The emphasis on empathy, unconditional positive regard, and congruence provided Wang with a safe space to explore her feelings and experiences without fear of judgment. This therapeutic alliance was instrumental in facilitating Wang's journey towards self-acceptance and personal growth. It highlights the significance of creating a nurturing environment where clients feel valued and understood, which is particularly crucial for adolescents who are navigating the complexities of identity formation.\n\nIn addition to cognitive and person-centered therapies, relaxation training proved to be an effective tool in Wang's therapeutic journey. Adolescents, like Wang, often experience heightened physiological arousal in response to stress, which can exacerbate feelings of anxiety and overwhelm. By incorporating relaxation techniques, Wang learned to manage her physiological responses to stress, leading to improved emotional regulation and a reduction in anxiety symptoms. This component of the therapeutic process underscores the interconnectedness of mind and body, emphasizing the need for holistic approaches in addressing psychological issues.\n\nReflecting on the consultation process, it is evident that establishing a comprehensive understanding of the client's background and current situation is paramount. Wang's familial context, characterized by high parental expectations and economic pressures, added layers of complexity to her psychological issues. Her parents' focus on academic achievement, while well-intentioned, inadvertently contributed to her feelings of inadequacy and anxiety. This case highlights the importance of considering familial and cultural dynamics in the therapeutic process, as they often play a significant role in shaping an individual's psychological landscape.\n\nMoreover, the feedback from Wang's mother and class teacher provided valuable insights into her behavioral patterns and social interactions, further informing the therapeutic approach. The teacher's observations of Wang's introverted nature and recent changes in mood were consistent with the self-reported experiences of anxiety and social difficulties. This alignment between external observations and self-reports underscores the importance of a collaborative approach in therapy, where input from various sources can enrich the understanding of the client's challenges and inform the intervention strategy.\n\nThe results of psychological testing, particularly the elevated scores on the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), reinforced the clinical observations and diagnosis of general psychological issues. These findings underscored the need for targeted interventions to address Wang's anxiety and prevent the potential escalation of depressive symptoms. It is crucial to continuously monitor and evaluate the client's progress, adapting therapeutic strategies as necessary to ensure optimal outcomes.\n\nA key reflection from this case is the value of employing a flexible and integrative approach to therapy. While each therapeutic modality has its strengths, the combination of person-centered therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and relaxation training allowed for a more comprehensive and effective intervention. This integrative approach enabled us to address the cognitive, emotional, and physiological aspects of Wang's psychological issues, facilitating a more holistic healing process. It serves as a reminder that therapeutic success often lies in the ability to adapt and tailor interventions to the unique needs of each client.\n\nIn addition to clinical techniques, the case of Wang highlights the importance of fostering resilience and self-efficacy in adolescents. By encouraging Wang to recognize her strengths and capabilities, we aimed to instill a sense of hope and agency in her. This empowerment is crucial in helping adolescents navigate the challenges of high school and beyond, equipping them with the skills and confidence needed to thrive in various aspects of life.\n\nFurthermore, the case underscores the importance of ongoing reflection and professional development for clinicians. By critically analyzing our therapeutic approaches and outcomes, we can identify areas for improvement and enhance our effectiveness in future cases. This commitment to continuous learning and growth is essential in providing the highest quality of care to clients.\n\nIn conclusion, the case of Wang offers valuable insights into the psychological issues faced by adolescents in high-pressure environments. It underscores the importance of a comprehensive and integrative therapeutic approach, addressing cognitive, emotional, and physiological aspects of psychological distress. By fostering a supportive and empowering therapeutic environment, we can help adolescents like Wang develop the resilience and self-efficacy needed to navigate the complexities of interpersonal relationships and personal growth. This case serves as a reminder of the profound impact that thoughtful and compassionate therapeutic interventions can have on the lives of young individuals, guiding them towards a path of self-discovery and fulfillment.", "causes": "Personality traits (introversion, sensitivity) and a decline in academic ranking after entering high school, difficulties in interpersonal interactions, thus manifesting anxiety and depression.", "symptoms": "Anxiety, depression.", "treatment_process": "Humanistic therapy: empathy, unconditional positive regard and consistency, creating a supportive therapeutic environment for the visitor;\n Cognitive-behavioral therapy: change the irrational cognition that self-worth depends on the evaluation of others;\n Relaxation training: improving anxiety, reducing anxiety, and learning to manage one's physiological response to stress.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Anxiety, depression, and a desire for recognition and acceptance.", "treatment_effect": "The counselor adopts a comprehensive and integrated treatment approach, through creating a supportive therapeutic environment, to change the irrational cognition of , and to enhance the resilience and self-efficacy needed for adolescent development to cope with complex interpersonal relationships and personal growth."}
{"id": 104, "case_description": ["Visitor, male, 30 years old, primary issue is insomnia for one month accompanied by widespread bodily discomfort."], "consultation_process": ["Last Friday, Xiao A came to our hospital's psychological counseling room for treatment due to insomnia, accompanied by his mother. I received Xiao A together with Teacher Wang. Xiao A said that he hadn't had a good night's sleep for over a month and was unable to work normally or rest at home. The visitor reported that every night he lay in bed tossing and turning, unable to fall asleep. Even when he occasionally fell asleep, he would wake up immediately. He felt extremely distressed. In addition to his insomnia, he also experienced symptoms such as tightness in his head, a sensation of obstruction in his throat, chest tightness, difficulty breathing, and overall fatigue. He mentioned that while lying in bed, it felt as if the lower part of the back of his head was elevated with bricks, and his back felt like it was resting on bricks. After getting comfortable with his head and back, he would feel as though there was a rope tightening around his throat and a burning sensation in his stomach, sometimes leading to feelings of nausea. He stated that he had undergone many medical examinations but had not found any organic diseases.", "The visitor has a wide range of physical symptoms caused by anxiety. He has previously been treated by a psychiatrist and prescribed medication. After taking the medication for half a month, there was no improvement in his physical symptoms or sleep, and he experienced some side effects that he could not accept. He has unilaterally stopped taking the medication for more than twenty days and is unwilling to continue the treatment.", "I asked the visitor what methods he had used to fall asleep, and he said that his work made him very anxious. He couldn't sleep the first night, so the next night he went to bed early, but still couldn't fall asleep. He struggled to sleep for several nights in a row. Eventually, he took a leave of absence to rest at home. During the day, he would lie in bed to rest, and at night, he would go to bed early again. After getting into bed, he tried to fall asleep by listening to music and counting sheep, but still couldn't sleep. After many days of sleeplessness, he began to worry that his lungs and liver would be affected by not sleeping for a long time. The more he thought about it, the more anxious he became, and the more anxious he got, the less he could sleep. Later, he tried to drink alcohol before bed to help him sleep, but contrary to his intentions, he still couldn't sleep all night long. Moreover, due to his worries, his initially simple insomnia developed into symptoms of overall discomfort.", "Due to the fact that the visitor has undergone many medical examinations and organic diseases have been ruled out, and considering that the visitor's extensive physical discomfort is a result of anxiety leading to a prolonged state of sympathetic nervous system activation, I believe that in order to improve the patient's sleep, we must first alleviate the patient's physical symptoms. Therefore, we considered implementing relaxation training for the patient. Initially, I thought of using deep breathing to activate the visitor's parasympathetic nervous system, to slow down their heart rate and breathing, lower blood pressure, and dilate the blood vessels in the internal organs, skin, and muscles, achieving a state of physical relaxation to relieve symptoms of head tension, chest tightness, palpitations, muscle pain, and overall fatigue. However, the visitor was too anxious to concentrate on deep breathing and could not close their eyes; when they did try to close their eyes and breathe deeply, they felt even tenser, and their throat blockage worsened. We immediately switched to a modified muscle relaxation method, guiding them to first tense their muscles and then relax them. We instructed them to contract and relax from head to toe. After completing one round, the visitor joyfully informed us that their throat was no longer blocked, their head felt comfortable, and their whole body felt relaxed. We advised them to practice full-body contraction and relaxation exercises at home twice daily. Next, we guided the visitor to practice sleep-promoting exercises, and I asked them to perform these exercises twice a day at home.", "Finally, I provide sleep hygiene education to the visitors. I point out that sleep is a natural instinct for humans, just like eating. When a person is hungry, they need to eat; when they are tired, they need to sleep. To enter a sleep state, one must accumulate enough sleep drive, meaning one needs to feel sleepy to fall asleep. The longer one stays awake, the stronger the sleep drive and the greater the sleepiness. Napping and dozing during the day can reduce sleep drive, making it difficult to fall asleep at night.", "I also pointed out that to have good sleep, it is necessary to establish a conditioned reflex for the bed and sleep. The bed is only for sleeping and sexual activities; do not listen to music, use a mobile phone, or read newspapers in bed. If you are not sleepy, do not enter the bedroom; you can stay in the living room or study until you feel tired enough to go to bed. If you still cannot fall asleep after 15 minutes in bed, get up and read a book, preferably something rather dull, or engage in some monotonous activities, as this makes it easier to feel drowsy. Once you feel sleepy again, return to bed. Additionally, limit the time spent in bed, avoid napping during the day, and get up on time the next morning. His usual wake-up time is 7 a.m., so he needs to get up at 7 a.m. sharp, even if he still feels sleepy at that time. Furthermore, do not drink alcohol before bed, as it has a sedative effect; however, like sleeping pills, it makes it harder to fall asleep after the sedative effect wears off, and it can also lead to waking up early. We also advised him to engage in appropriate exercise and schedule some time to meet with friends or relatives.", "The visitor came for a follow-up appointment on Monday morning. He reported that after the last treatment, he continued to practice muscle contraction and relaxation exercises and the sleep aid exercises twice a day. His physical discomfort symptoms have greatly improved, and his sleep has significantly improved. He mentioned that he went to bed at 9:30 PM on Friday, fell asleep immediately after getting into bed, and slept very soundly until 7 AM the next morning. On Saturday, he went to bed a little after 9 AM, fell asleep quickly, woke up once but fell back asleep after about half an hour, and slept until after 7 AM the next day. On Sunday, he also went to bed at 9:30 PM, fell asleep immediately, and had a very sweet sleep.", "My thoughts on the patient's insomnia and this treatment are as follows:", "The reasons for the visitor's insomnia may include several aspects. Firstly, it may be related to his anxious personality; his mother mentioned that he cried a lot since birth and was difficult to manage. He had severe physical illnesses during childhood, and the discomfort he experienced during those times is likely stored as bodily memory. Under pressure or during insomnia, this feeling from his early illness is activated in his body. The second factor contributing to his insomnia may be related to his daily work. The third and most important factor is that he has adopted poor sleep behaviors after experiencing insomnia, which helps maintain his insomnia. For example, he engages in napping and goes to bed without feeling sleepy. After experiencing insomnia, he lies in bed during the day to rest and is afraid to go out at night or arrange any activities. Instead, he goes to bed early at 7 PM, waiting to sleep, and tries to force himself to sleep. He has negative cognitions, believing that sleep can be controlled and that not sleeping well will damage his lungs and liver. The more he thinks about sleeping, the more he struggles to fall asleep, and the more he struggles, the more he worries and thinks irrationally. This excessive thinking and worrying lead to increased tension and anxiety, resulting in widespread physical discomfort. Due to the visitor's avoidance and negative cognitions, he is in a heightened state of cognitive arousal, which, combined with his anxiety, results in a high state of physiological arousal. This cognitive and physiological arousal prevents him from falling asleep. Additionally, his habit of lying in bed for long periods during the day and going to bed early at night leads to a lack of motivation for sleep, making it difficult for him to fall asleep and disrupting his sleep rhythm. His pre-sleep alcohol consumption will also exacerbate his insomnia symptoms in the long run.", "Moreover, the visitor has not formed a conditioned reflex between the bed and sleep. According to stimulus control theory, a single stimulus can evoke multiple responses. In a simple conditioning process, a stimulus paired with a single response is likely to produce only one response. However, in a complex conditioning process, one or more stimuli can lead to various responses. This mechanism also applies to the issue of insomnia, where sleep-related cues (such as the bed, bedroom, and bedtime) are too frequently paired with responses unrelated to sleep. As a result, to cope with insomnia, patients spend too much time awake in bed/bedroom engaging in activities other than sleep. For instance, if a visitor listens to music or plays on their phone in bed and becomes restless and anxious from being awake for a long time without falling asleep, it leads to a broad conditioned reflex between the bed and the phone, music, and wakefulness. Therefore, we limit activities unrelated to sleep in the bedroom and on the bed through stimulus control. If one does not fall asleep within 15 minutes of getting into bed or wakes up at night, they should leave the bedroom to ensure the pairing of the bed and sleep, establishing a conditioned reflex between the bedroom/bed and sleep.", "By using full-body muscle contraction and relaxation exercises, the visitors are thoroughly relaxed. When the body relaxes, the mind also relaxes. Once both the body and mind are relaxed, the visitor's physiological state of high arousal is alleviated. By correcting the visitor's negative cognition and reasonably arranging their life and activities, including meeting with friends, it helps the visitor reduce anxiety and alleviate the cognitive state of high arousal. Lower physiological and cognitive arousal will further promote the accumulation of sleep drive.", "Leisure Sleep Exercise is developed by Dr. Sun Wei based on the Daoist health-preserving skill \"Foundation Building\" in China, guided by traditional Chinese medicine meridian theory, and combined with mindfulness therapy. By practicing \"Leisure Sleep Exercise,\" the focus is mainly on rotating the torso between the head and the waist to strengthen the Ren and Du meridians. Practicing \"Leisure Sleep Exercise\" can help participants feel a sense of physical and mental pleasure, calmness, and tranquility.", "By limiting the time visitors spend in bed, sleep drive accumulates, allowing them to fall asleep quickly. By encouraging visitors to leave the bedroom and bed while they are still awake and only get into bed when they are tired, a conditioned reflex is formed between the bed and sleep. This way, once visitors enter the bedroom and get into bed, they can immediately fall asleep."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on the treatment journey of Xiao A, it is apparent that the rapid improvement in his condition can be attributed to a combination of effective therapeutic techniques and the visitor’s high level of compliance. The contraction and relaxation of whole-body muscles, alongside the practice of sleep exercises and the regulation of time spent in bed, proved instrumental in alleviating Xiao A's insomnia. This outcome highlights the significance of a multi-faceted approach in psychotherapy, where physiological, cognitive, and behavioral components are addressed in tandem.\n\nOne of the pivotal factors in Xiao A's case was the establishment of a strong therapeutic alliance. The counselor-visitor relationship forms the foundation upon which effective interventions are built. It is through this trust and mutual respect that Xiao A felt secure enough to engage fully with the prescribed exercises and adhere to the therapeutic regimen. This compliance was not just a passive following of instructions but an active engagement that facilitated rapid progress.\n\nThe case also underscores the importance of addressing underlying anxiety and cognitive arousal. Xiao A's insomnia was not merely a symptom but a manifestation of deeper psychological distress. His history of severe physical illnesses during childhood, coupled with an anxious personality, contributed to a heightened state of cognitive and physiological arousal. This case illustrates the intricate interplay between past experiences, personality traits, and current stressors in the development and maintenance of insomnia.\n\nBy employing relaxation techniques, we targeted the physiological arousal that perpetuated Xiao A’s insomnia. The initial attempt to use deep breathing exercises was met with resistance due to his inability to concentrate and relax. This led to the adoption of modified muscle relaxation techniques, which proved more effective. This adaptability in approach highlights the necessity of tailoring interventions to suit individual needs and responses, a critical skill in psychotherapy.\n\nMoreover, Xiao A's case revealed the significance of correcting maladaptive sleep behaviors and cognitive patterns. His initial attempts to manage insomnia, such as napping during the day and going to bed without feeling sleepy, inadvertently reinforced his sleep difficulties. These behaviors, coupled with his negative beliefs about sleep, created a vicious cycle of anxiety and insomnia. By restructuring these cognitions and implementing stimulus control techniques, we aimed to break this cycle and foster healthier sleep habits.\n\nThe role of stimulus control in establishing a conditioned reflex between the bed and sleep was crucial. By limiting activities unrelated to sleep in the bedroom, we strengthened the association between the bed and sleep. This approach is rooted in the understanding that our environment plays a significant role in shaping behaviors and responses. By modifying Xiao A's sleep environment and routines, we facilitated the development of a more robust sleep-wake pattern.\n\nFurthermore, the incorporation of \"Leisure Sleep Exercise\" provided Xiao A with a culturally resonant tool that aligned with his values and beliefs. This exercise, inspired by traditional Chinese medicine and mindfulness, offered a holistic approach to managing stress and promoting relaxation. The practice not only addressed the physical tension but also nurtured a sense of mental calmness and tranquility, essential for restful sleep.\n\nIn retrospect, this case reinforces the importance of a comprehensive assessment that considers biological, psychological, and social factors. While the immediate improvement in Xiao A's sleep was gratifying, it is imperative to recognize that sustaining these gains requires ongoing attention to his overall well-being. This includes addressing any residual psychological stress, promoting a healthy lifestyle, and fostering supportive interpersonal relationships.\n\nThe case also prompts a reflection on the broader implications for clinical practice. It highlights the need for clinicians to remain flexible and creative in their therapeutic approaches, continually adapting to the unique needs of each visitor. It also underscores the value of integrating culturally informed practices, which can enhance engagement and effectiveness.\n\nIn conclusion, Xiao A's treatment journey offers valuable insights into the complex nature of insomnia and its treatment. It serves as a reminder of the power of a well-rounded, individualized approach that considers the whole person, not just the symptoms. As clinicians, it is our responsibility to guide visitors through this process, empowering them to reclaim their sleep and, by extension, their overall health and well-being.", "causes": "Anxiety and insomnia due to work stress.", "symptoms": "Mood anxiety, insomnia with a wide range of somatization Symptoms.", "treatment_process": "Listening and empathy: relationship building;\n Relaxation training: to relieve general discomfort and somatization symptoms;\n Cognitive-behavioral therapy: to change the visitor's negative cognition;\n Behavioral therapy: establishing conditioned reflexes between bed and sleep.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Anxious personality due to childhood illness, insomnia, anxiety and generalized discomfort caused by work stress.", "treatment_effect": "The counselor first improved the visitor's physical discomfort through muscle relaxation training, then established the conditioned reflex between bed and sleep through behavioral therapy, and changed the irrational cognition of the visitor about sleep, clarified the concept of sleep drive that only sleepy people fall asleep, and thus helped the visitor to improve her insomnia."}
{"id": 105, "case_description": ["Emotional stress caused by mother's favoritism, work stress, and family pressure."], "consultation_process": ["Because growth happens at this moment: the darkest moment of life, alone. Darkness and loneliness equal trauma. In these dark moments, they bleed without being bandaged, and their lives begin to lose energy. What we need to do is return to those dark moments and rebuild the framework of their lives. When Zhen came to the consultation, she felt her world was in chaos. Once, holding her one-year-old son on the balcony, she had the urge to throw him down; at the same time, she had a huge argument with her boss, who withheld her annual salary; her husband was also in a fierce quarrel with her. What made her even sadder was that she found out her mother secretly gave all the family savings to her brother, and when she needed her mother the most, her mother said she had no money! These were the words she spoke in the first half hour of starting the consultation. Her tone was sharp, she was crying like a child, and she spoke incoherently, summarizing her story, which I recorded. Zhen: This week has been terrible for me; nothing is going right. My work has encountered significant difficulties; my boss threatened that if I couldn't meet my targets this month, there would be no year-end bonus, and I wouldn’t need to come to work next year! I panicked immediately. When I got home, I kept crying, and my husband asked me what was wrong. I told him, what’s the use? He yelled at me; then my mom came over to ask for this month's living expenses. Doesn’t she have secret savings? I’m about to get fired, and she still asks me for money? … It is evident that Zhen is a \"suffering type\" visitor; such visitors have too much bitter tears in their lives, and they are eager to vent, but the problem is that after they narrate their overwhelming and complicated stories, you cannot process them at all, and in the end, they will feel unsatisfied. In fact, even if it were three days and three nights, she still couldn't finish her story. So after listening for about 15 minutes and grasping the main events, I planned to slowly clarify her pain. My focus was not on the events but on her emotions, which drove her wild from one topic to another. Counselor: Continuous blows, this surround of despair has nearly broken you. When you are on the verge of breaking down, how do you feel? Zhen: Teacher Liu, what should I do? (Crying) To some extent, she uses various tragic stories to mask deeper inner pain, such as inner emptiness and the fear of powerlessness. If she becomes an accuser, she might feel more empowered. When I began to touch her emotions, she refused to engage because it was a terrifying experience she could not bear, so either she would keep talking, or she would hope I would solve everything for her. What I needed to do was slowly guide her back to the world of emotions; this is our battlefield. In the early stages of my consultations, whenever a visitor said, \"What should I do?\", I would panic because I didn't have enough capacity to absorb their anxiety and would be overwhelmed by it. At this point, the counselor's personality power began to take effect. Counselor: You seem completely at a loss; this challenge is too great. How do you cope with such a terrible day? When a visitor dumps too many negative emotions onto you, you need to assess: Is she really that bad? Or is her negativity a form of defense? Often, they overly focus on the unsatisfactory parts of life, while undervaluing their resources and those of others. If you empathize with her at this time, you may fall into an endless abyss; she will become increasingly immersed in superficial, hysterical emotional outbreaks, successfully avoiding the core emotions she fears. So at this point, I would emphasize her capabilities and \"empower\" her. I would not agree with her negativity; instead, I would highlight her own energy. Counselor: Have you encountered bad times before? How did you handle them? Zhen: Yes, there was a time when a voice said: I can endure this; I still have hope; there must be another way! When a visitor has resources, don’t let it go to waste, especially those who are immersed in their own pain. They might not realize how outstanding they are as crisis responders, and what often supports their long-term \"resistance\" are the significant others in their lives. Connecting them with their resources will add more than just a bitter color to their lives; it can also bring a touch of warmth. Even a \"little flower on a grave\" is better than complete desolation. Counselor: Can you talk more about that voice? Zhen: I just remembered, it’s like my mother’s voice. When I was a child, I broke my leg and went to several hospitals. The doctors said amputation was necessary, but my mother didn’t believe it and kept saying there must be another way. Finally, at the fifth hospital, the doctor thought surgery could be done, and in the end, my leg was saved. My mother saved me! Counselor: So your mother's voice is a pillar for you when facing danger. Zhen: But she gave all her secret savings to my brother. Counselor: So you feel a bit conflicted? On one hand, your mother’s persistence makes you feel loved, and her strength is your support when you are about to break down; on the other hand, you are reluctant to acknowledge her role because you are still upset with her. When a visitor throws a pile of anxiety and panic at us, we need to assess which emotions are deep, which are merely functional surface emotions, which are primary, and which are secondary. Once we can clearly see the visitor's emotions, we can follow her emotions into the deepest part of her heart. For example, I hypothesize that the deepest emotion in her chaotic anxiety outbreak is her mother giving secret savings to her brother, and that action hurts her the most. However, the visitor tries to brush past this emotion with an indifferent disdain. At this point, we have a choice. If we have established a good enough relationship with the visitor, we can try to see how she handles deep emotions. Zhen: It’s better not to mention such a mother. Counselor: Yes, in your view, with such a biased mother, why even bring it up? Maybe you just want to forget her. Zhen: How could she still have the nerve to ask me for living expenses! Counselor: She saved the living expenses you gave her for your brother… In her tears, when reaching the core emotion, she becomes indifferent instead. This is where we can intervene when we have established a certain level of safety in the relationship. This statement is a bit insidious because it seems to provoke her sensitive nerves, which will stimulate her. Only by provoking her core emotions can her pain be truly released. It’s like a massage; we need enough pressure to help the knotted muscles relax while also being careful not to exert too much force and cause injury. This requires a bit of probing and a bit of rendering, watching the other person's reactions and adjusting accordingly. Zhen: (voice rising an octave) How dare she! I’ve been serving her like I’m catering to Empress Dowager Cixi, trying to please her cautiously, sacrificing so much, and she turns a blind eye, only thinking about that useless son who never pays her attention. Am I not her biological child? Counselor: You’re very angry. You’ve put in a lot of effort to maintain your relationship with your mother, but in the end, you find she gives so much love to your brother, who never reciprocates; that’s too unbalanced. No wonder you feel so sad and wronged, as if your contributions mean nothing in your mother's eyes... Zhen: (starts crying again) Am I really that bad? Mom, I just want to see you smile at me, I just want you to care about me a little bit, just this little bit, is it that hard? Mom… At this moment, Zhen finally reached the core emotion. In this emotion, she no longer displays her anger fiercely or exaggerates her pain with excitement; she enters a more regressed state because everyone's capacity to bear pain is limited. This is just a demonstration. This is merely a small wave amidst the tumultuous sea of consultation; in fact, it is very difficult for a person to reach deep inner emotions because they often accumulate too much hurt. These hurts become an undercurrent that continuously impacts our lives due to years of unresolved issues, until we can slowly present them. This presentation process is brutal; some might say, you call that empathy? It’s simply stabbing the bleeding heart. In fact, the similarity between doctors and butchers is that they both engage in a bloody trade, except one is for construction, and the other is for destruction. Both involve cutting open, but one is for healing after stitching, while the other is for dismembering after slaughtering."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on this particular case with Zhen, I find myself revisiting the profound dynamics of emotional stress and how it manifests in the therapeutic space. The journey with Zhen was a testament to the complexity of human emotions and the nuanced role of a counselor in navigating these intricacies. As counselors, we find ourselves standing in the darkest corners of our clients' lives, not because we are immune to the shadows, but because we have the strength and clarity to illuminate these spaces. We become the holders of hope, the architects of resilience, and the facilitators of healing.\n\nThe initial stages of Zhen's consultation were marked by a torrent of emotions, a deluge of despair that seemed unending. Her narrative was a complex tapestry woven with threads of familial betrayal, professional anxiety, and personal disillusionment. Her expression was raw, unfiltered, a cacophony of feelings that demanded attention yet resisted coherence. It was evident that Zhen was a 'suffering type' visitor, one whose life was punctuated by bitter tears and unresolved grievances. Her narrative was not merely a recounting of events but a visceral outpouring of pain, a desperate attempt to make sense of her fragmented world.\n\nIn these moments, the role of the counselor transcends mere listening; it becomes an act of holding, of containing the chaos within a safe therapeutic frame. It requires a delicate balance between empathy and guidance, a dance between acknowledging the client's pain and steering them towards introspection and healing. The counselor's presence must be both grounding and empowering, providing a sanctuary where the client can explore their deepest fears without judgment or reprisal.\n\nAs Zhen recounted her week of turmoil, the themes of powerlessness and betrayal became increasingly apparent. Her mother's favoritism, the withholding of resources, and the subsequent familial tension were not isolated incidents but interconnected experiences that compounded her sense of worthlessness. Her work-related stress further exacerbated these feelings, leaving her trapped in a cycle of anxiety and despair. Each element of her story was like a piece of a puzzle, contributing to the overarching narrative of feeling unseen and undervalued.\n\nIn such cases, it becomes crucial to differentiate between the surface emotions and the underlying core emotions. Surface emotions are often defensive, a protective layer that shields the client from confronting their deeper vulnerabilities. For Zhen, the surface emotion was anger—anger at her mother, her boss, her husband. However, beneath this anger lay a more profound sense of hurt and longing—a yearning for recognition, love, and acceptance. The challenge for the counselor is to gently peel back these layers, to create a space where the client feels safe enough to confront and articulate these core emotions.\n\nThe therapeutic process with Zhen involved a series of strategic interventions aimed at reconnecting her with her inner resources. One such intervention was highlighting her past resilience, reminding her of the inner strength she had exhibited in overcoming previous adversities. This not only served to empower her but also to shift her focus from helplessness to agency. It was essential to help Zhen recognize that despite the overwhelming nature of her current circumstances, she possessed the capacity to navigate through them.\n\nIn the therapeutic space, we often encounter clients who are so entrenched in their narratives of pain that they lose sight of their inherent strengths. As counselors, part of our role is to hold up a mirror to these strengths, to reflect back to our clients their resilience and potential for growth. This is not to negate their pain but to provide a counterbalance, a reminder that they are more than their struggles.\n\nThe exploration of Zhen's relationship with her mother was particularly poignant. It was a relationship fraught with contradictions—love intertwined with resentment, loyalty marred by betrayal. Her mother's actions, giving the secret savings to her brother, were a significant source of pain for Zhen. Yet, her mother also represented a voice of hope and persistence, a paradox that Zhen struggled to reconcile. This duality is not uncommon in familial relationships, where the very individuals who are sources of support can also become sources of profound hurt.\n\nIn addressing this, the therapeutic approach involved validating Zhen's feelings of betrayal while also exploring the positive aspects of her relationship with her mother. This dual approach allowed Zhen to process her emotions in a more nuanced manner, acknowledging the complexity of her feelings rather than viewing them in black-and-white terms. It also opened up a dialogue about forgiveness and acceptance, about finding peace in the midst of relational turmoil.\n\nAs Zhen navigated through her emotions, the therapeutic relationship played a crucial role in providing stability and support. The counselor's role was not to provide solutions but to facilitate exploration, to guide Zhen as she charted her path towards healing. This involved moments of gentle provocation, challenging her to confront the core emotions she feared, to move beyond the surface narrative and delve into the deeper layers of her psyche.\n\nIn the latter stages of our work together, Zhen began to access these deeper emotions, moving beyond anger to a place of vulnerability and longing. Her tears, once a manifestation of frustration, became a release of pent-up grief—a mourning for the relationship she wished she had with her mother, for the recognition she craved but never received. In these moments, the therapeutic space transformed into a sanctuary of healing, a place where Zhen could confront her pain without fear of judgment.\n\nReflecting on this case, I am reminded of the transformative power of therapy, of the profound impact that a safe and supportive therapeutic relationship can have on a client's journey towards healing. The process is often messy and nonlinear, fraught with setbacks and breakthroughs. Yet, it is in this very messiness that healing occurs, in the willingness to sit with discomfort, to explore the shadows, and to emerge with newfound clarity and strength.\n\nAs a counselor, the experience with Zhen reinforced the importance of holding space for clients, of being present with them in their darkest moments. It highlighted the need for patience and empathy, for allowing clients the time and space to process their emotions at their own pace. It also underscored the significance of empowerment, of helping clients reconnect with their inner resources and recognize their capacity for resilience.\n\nIn conclusion, the journey with Zhen was a powerful reminder of the intricate dance between darkness and light, between pain and healing. It was an affirmation of the counselor's role as a guide and companion, as someone who stands beside the client in their moments of despair, offering hope and support as they navigate their path towards the dawn of a new beginning. This case, like many others, served as a testament to the enduring strength of the human spirit and the transformative power of therapy in unlocking that strength.", "causes": "Emotional breakdown due to work stress, conflict with motherhood", "symptoms": "Anxious to vent, emotional breakdown", "treatment_process": "Acceptance and listening: relationship building;\n Gestalt therapy: focusing on the here and now, finding personal resources to get out of the situation;", "characteristics_of_illness": "Psychological conflict caused by the mother's preference for sons and the inner attachment to the mother.", "treatment_effect": "Through Gestalt therapy, the counselor clarifies the deep-seated emotions from the visitor's confessions, i.e., the visitor adopts the psychological defense mechanism of denial because of her mother's son preference and her attachment to her mother, and the counselor helps the visitor discover the psychological resources to get out of the predicament through the emotional blasting technique."}
{"id": 106, "case_description": ["Visitor: Female, 36 years old", "Main issue: Anxiety disorder accompanied by depression.", "Visitor's self-statement:", "The visitor is a middle manager in the company. Due to the high work pressure and seeing colleagues around her becoming irritable from stress, she occasionally comes across examples on her phone of people who have taken extreme actions due to excessive anxiety. These negative messages have a significant impact on her. She worries that one day she might not be able to cope and something unexpected could happen. Under such worries and anxieties, she has become sensitive and suspicious, leading to a significant decrease in her sleep quality at night, which in turn lowers her work efficiency. She has lost interest in some things, finds herself ruminating uncontrollably, and the more she thinks, the more afraid she becomes, which in turn increases her anxiety. \"It feels like I live in anxiety every day,\" she says. She feels that her anxiety is not only confined to internal feelings such as restlessness, oppression, and sorrow but also often manifests in her behavior. She can no longer concentrate on work, is restless, experiences difficulty breathing, numbness in her limbs, excessive sweating, dizziness, fatigue, and insomnia or waking up startled from dreams. This period of anxiety has caused significant disruption to her physical and mental well-being, as well as to her life and work. Prolonged anxiety has made her look haggard, caused weight loss, and even triggered illnesses, greatly affecting her health. This anxious state has led her to feel the need to seek help from a psychological expert to guide her in overcoming this distressing anxiety. Therefore, she has come to seek psychological counseling, hoping to eliminate the interference of anxiety, adjust her mindset, change her perception, and achieve a better state of being."], "consultation_process": ["Consultation process", "Analyze the reasons:", "The causes of anxiety disorders are mostly due to sensitivity, suspicion, mental tension, high work or thought pressure, anger, trauma from life events, changes in the environment, and other factors. Some anxiety disorder patients often express feelings of restlessness, inability to sit still, psychological tension, insomnia, and racing thoughts, which can lead to headaches, insomnia, fatigue, excessive sweating, palpitations, and other symptoms. This emotion cannot be shaken off or clarified, and the more they think about it, the more irritated they become, which indicates they have an anxiety neurosis, also known as an anxiety disorder. This is a persistent emotional disorder characterized by restlessness, tension, and fear. It may involve a lack of specific psychological tension and unpleasant anticipatory emotions, leading to inexplicable tension and unease; or it may be a result of being repeatedly impacted by unfavorable events, where the mind cannot cope, resulting in an excessive state of physical and mental fatigue that gradually forms feelings of tension and unease; or it may stem from a “premonition” or “imagination” of certain events, leading to constant worry, distress, and irritability about future occurrences. The mental state may manifest as constant confusion, worry, depression, and a sense of impending doom, feeling anxious and fearful throughout the day, easily disturbed by trivial matters. There is self-blame, a tendency to think negatively about situations, resentment towards others, lamenting one's own circumstances, a tendency to nag, lose temper, and be restless. Anxiety can easily lead to anxiety-related insomnia, with the most prominent symptom being shallow sleep, difficulty falling asleep, and waking up at the slightest noise, making it hard to fall back asleep. The next day, they often say they dreamed all night, feeling drained during the day, lacking interest and energy in any activity or work. Anxiety-related insomnia is characterized primarily by difficulty in falling asleep, where after lying in bed, they toss and turn without being able to sleep, thinking about anxious matters that cannot be resolved, leading to increased excitement and further insomnia. Over time, the patient develops a fear of sleep itself, constantly worrying at night about whether they will be unable to sleep, which ultimately results in insomnia. This vicious cycle causes great distress for the individual, who hopes to find fundamental solutions to overcome insomnia and anxiety.", "Solution:", "1. Increase self-confidence: Self-confidence is a necessary prerequisite for healing neurotic anxiety. Some people who lack self-confidence doubt their ability to accomplish and cope with tasks, exaggerating the possibility of their failure, which leads to worry, tension, and fear.", "Therefore, as a patient with neurotic anxiety disorder, you must first be confident and reduce feelings of inferiority. You should believe that with every increase in confidence, your level of anxiety will decrease a little, and restoring confidence will ultimately drive away anxiety.", "2. Self-relaxation: This means freeing oneself from tense emotions. For example, when you are in a slightly better mental state, imagine various possible dangerous scenarios, allowing the weakest scenario to appear first. By repeating this, you will gradually realize that any dangerous scenario or the entire process no longer causes anxiety. At this point, it can be considered terminated.", "3. Self-reflection: Some neurotic anxiety arises from the patient's repression of certain emotional experiences or desires, which are suppressed unconsciously but do not disappear and remain latent in the unconscious, leading to symptoms. When the condition manifests, you only feel pain and anxiety, without knowing the cause. Therefore, in such cases, you must engage in self-reflection and express the things in your subconscious that cause pain. If necessary, you can vent, and generally, the symptoms may alleviate after venting.", "4. Self-stimulation: After the onset of anxiety neurosis, patients often find themselves lost in chaotic thoughts, unable to sit still, perplexed, and in great pain. At this time, patients can use self-stimulation techniques to divert their attention. For example, when lost in thought, they can find an interesting book to read or engage in strenuous physical labor to forget their painful experiences. This can help prevent chaotic thoughts from leading to other symptoms, while also enhancing one's adaptability.", "5. Self-hypnosis: Most patients with anxiety disorders have sleep disturbances, making it difficult to fall asleep or causing them to wake suddenly from dreams. At this time, you can practice self-suggestive hypnosis.", "6. You can also relax through music. Based on principles of psychology and music therapy, each audio segment is guided by a deep and magnetic vocal energy, combined with professional healing music. Through detailed guidance, exercises for relaxation, breathing, and imagination stimulation are conducted to achieve deep release of psychological stress, improve sleep quality easily, and enhance the quality of life.", "7. Correct the unreasonable belief of \"excessive negativity.\" \"How could this happen to me? How could I be so unlucky?\" In surveys and conversations with many visitors, we often hear such excessively negative voices, and it is necessary to correct these unreasonable and unscientific beliefs.", "8. List the worst scenarios you are worried about and prioritize them. Then analyze each one, and you will find that the final result is not as dire as \"not being able to survive.\" Secondly, prepare a \"I'm awesome\" rewards bulletin board. Stick all your progress on it with sticky notes, no matter how small the progress is, and display it to remind yourself.", "9. Express your anxiety. Regardless of the type of negative emotion, \"speaking out\" is an effective method. Introverted individuals often tend to close themselves off, living in their own world. In fact, just taking a step forward and talking more with a mental health professional can make it much easier to overcome the shadow of anxiety.", "10. Give up the idea of constantly blaming yourself and do what you enjoy. Endless complaints and self-blame are pointless; do something you like, even if it's something small. It should be simple and easy to do, without taking too much time. It might help to relax first, as this will create a sense of happiness and effectively alleviate anxiety."], "experience_and_reflection": "In reflecting upon the therapeutic journey with this client, a deeper understanding of the multifaceted nature of anxiety disorders has emerged. Anxiety, as an emotional experience, is both complex and nuanced, often intricately woven into the fabric of an individual's daily life. Our client, a 36-year-old female middle manager, presents a compelling case of anxiety disorder with panic attacks, compounded by depressive symptoms. Her narrative provides a lens through which we can explore the underlying psychological mechanisms that perpetuate her anxiety and the therapeutic interventions that can facilitate her path to recovery.\n\nThe client's self-statement paints a vivid picture of her lived experience. Her anxiety is not only a private, internal struggle but also one that manifests behaviorally and impacts her professional and personal life. Her concerns about work pressure and the distressing stories she encounters on her phone act as significant triggers, exacerbating her sensitivity and leading to a cascade of physical symptoms. This highlights a critical aspect of anxiety disorders—the interplay between cognitive processes, emotional experiences, and physiological responses.\n\nFrom a clinical perspective, the client's case underscores the importance of addressing the cognitive distortions that fuel her anxiety. Cognitive therapy, therefore, plays a pivotal role in helping her identify and challenge the negative thought patterns that contribute to her heightened state of fear and restlessness. By reframing her perceptions and beliefs, she can begin to dismantle the catastrophic thinking that underlies her anxiety. For instance, her fear of not being able to cope is rooted in a cognitive bias that overestimates the likelihood and severity of negative outcomes. Through cognitive restructuring, she learns to evaluate her thoughts more realistically, reducing the intensity of her anxiety response.\n\nHypnotherapy complements cognitive therapy by facilitating deeper exploration of the subconscious mind, where many of her unresolved emotional conflicts reside. This therapeutic modality allows her to access and process repressed emotions and desires that manifest as anxiety symptoms. The hypnotic state provides a safe space for her to confront and release these latent emotions, paving the way for symptom alleviation and emotional healing.\n\nThe consultation process reveals the complexity of anxiety disorders, which often arise from a confluence of factors such as sensitivity, suspicion, mental tension, and external stressors. It is evident that our client experiences a persistent state of heightened arousal, marked by symptoms such as insomnia, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating. These symptoms are not merely byproducts of her anxiety but are integral components that perpetuate the disorder. Understanding the cyclical nature of anxiety is crucial for devising effective intervention strategies.\n\nOne of the most salient insights from this case is the role of self-confidence in mitigating anxiety. A lack of self-confidence can exacerbate feelings of vulnerability and helplessness, leading to an exaggerated perception of threats and an impaired ability to cope. Building self-confidence, therefore, becomes a therapeutic goal. By encouraging the client to recognize her strengths and accomplishments, she begins to shift her focus from perceived failures to personal achievements, thereby fostering a sense of agency and empowerment.\n\nSelf-relaxation techniques also emerge as vital tools in the client's therapeutic arsenal. These techniques, which include visualization and controlled exposure to feared scenarios, help her regulate her emotional responses and reduce physiological arousal. By gradually desensitizing herself to anxiety-provoking stimuli, she learns to tolerate uncertainty and diminish the power of her fears.\n\nSelf-reflection, another therapeutic strategy, enables the client to gain insight into the root causes of her anxiety. By examining her emotional experiences and identifying patterns of repression, she can begin to understand the underlying dynamics that contribute to her distress. This process of introspection allows her to articulate and process emotions that were previously inaccessible, leading to greater emotional clarity and symptom relief.\n\nThe concept of self-stimulation, which involves redirecting attention away from anxiety-inducing thoughts, proves beneficial for the client. Engaging in activities that capture her interest or require physical exertion helps interrupt the cycle of rumination and reduces the intensity of her anxious thoughts. This strategy not only alleviates immediate distress but also enhances her adaptability and resilience.\n\nSelf-hypnosis and relaxation through music are additional interventions that support the client's journey toward improved mental health. These techniques promote relaxation and enhance sleep quality, addressing one of the most challenging aspects of her anxiety disorder—insomnia. By incorporating these practices into her daily routine, she cultivates a sense of calm and restores balance to her sleep-wake cycle.\n\nCorrecting unreasonable beliefs, particularly those rooted in excessive negativity, is a crucial aspect of the therapeutic process. The client's tendency to engage in self-blame and negative self-talk perpetuates her anxiety and undermines her self-worth. By challenging these beliefs and replacing them with more constructive and balanced perspectives, she learns to cultivate a more positive and realistic outlook.\n\nThe exercise of listing worst-case scenarios and analyzing their plausibility serves as a cognitive intervention to reduce anxiety. This practice helps the client confront her fears directly and assess their likelihood, ultimately revealing that the outcomes she dreads are often not as catastrophic as imagined. This realization fosters a sense of control and diminishes the power of her fears.\n\nExpressing anxiety through verbalization is another therapeutic avenue explored with the client. By articulating her fears and concerns, she externalizes her internal struggles, reducing their emotional burden. This process of expression is particularly beneficial for introverted individuals who may find it challenging to share their experiences. Through dialogue with a mental health professional, the client gains validation and support, facilitating her journey toward recovery.\n\nFinally, the therapeutic journey emphasizes the importance of relinquishing self-blame and engaging in activities that bring joy and fulfillment. By shifting her focus from criticism to self-compassion, the client begins to embrace her inherent worth and pursue activities that nurture her well-being. This shift not only alleviates anxiety but also enhances her overall quality of life.\n\nIn conclusion, this case reflection underscores the intricate interplay of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral factors in anxiety disorders. Through a comprehensive therapeutic approach that integrates cognitive therapy, hypnotherapy, and self-care strategies, the client embarks on a transformative journey toward healing. The insights gained from this case contribute to a deeper understanding of anxiety disorders and inform the development of effective therapeutic interventions that empower individuals to reclaim their lives from the grip of anxiety.", "causes": "Anxiety and panic attacks caused by work stress and negative information.", "symptoms": "Anxiety, insomnia, dyspnea and other somatization Symptoms.", "treatment_process": "Listening and empathy: Building relationships;\n Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: reshaping perceptions and beliefs to eliminate catastrophic thinking behind anxiety;\n Hypnotherapy: providing a safe space to face and release underlying emotions, lifting repressed states;\n Desensitization training: desensitizing the visitor to anxiety-provoking stimuli, learning to tolerate uncertainty and diminish fear.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Catastrophizing anxiety and panic attacks triggered by work stress and negative information.", "treatment_effect": "Through cognitive-behavioral therapy to change catastrophic cognitive thinking and desensitization training in daily life, the patient learns to face stressful events correctly, establishes a positive mindset and behavioral patterns, and enhances psychological resilience and self-confidence."}

Ultimately, both paths lead to failure; when students fail at tasks, they feel sad, resulting in heightened anxiety.", "Old Yan said: The person who loves you the most in the world can sometimes become the one who harms you the most.

Therefore, it is essential to impose strict requirements and fully protect students. However, if our practices exceed what students can bear, or even contradict the psychological principles of students, it will be counterproductive and detrimental.", "4. Unexpected high anxiety", "Accidents have a significant impact on children. For example, the illness or death of a loved one, car accidents, and bullying can greatly affect a child's emotions. The proportion of students experiencing depression due to such unexpected events is quite high."], "experience_and_reflection": "As I reflect on the case of Liu and her child, I am reminded of the profound complexity of student depression, particularly when it manifests as school refusal depression. This case compels me to delve deeper into the multifaceted causes of depression in students and the roles played by various external pressures. The initial diagnosis of \"moderate depression\" for Liu's child, confirmed by multiple reputable institutions, was a turning point not only for the family but also for my understanding of how external factors can profoundly influence a young person's mental health.\n\nOne of the most critical insights I have gathered over time is the pervasive influence of high anxiety as a core factor in student depression. Anxiety, especially when originating from external sources, can create a relentless cycle of stress that is difficult for students to break free from. In Liu's case, the pressures from both family and school environments were significant contributors to her child's condition. Understanding these external sources of anxiety is vital for developing effective therapeutic interventions and providing meaningful support to both students and their families.\n\nThe pressure related to academic performance is perhaps the most apparent external source of anxiety for students. Both parents and teachers often unknowingly contribute to this anxiety by placing excessive emphasis on academic success. Parents may continuously urge their children to strive for excellence, while teachers emphasize the importance of high grades. Although moderate anxiety can motivate students to perform better, excessive anxiety can lead to feelings of helplessness and a decline in self-esteem. In Liu's case, her child's obedience and past academic excellence may have been driven by a manageable level of anxiety. However, as academic demands increased in high school, the anxiety likely intensified, surpassing the child's coping capacity and contributing to depressive symptoms.\n\nAnother significant aspect to consider is the anxiety stemming from the family environment. Family dynamics, particularly conflicts between parents or within extended family structures, can create a sense of insecurity in children. This insecurity often translates into heightened anxiety levels. In many cases, children are caught in the crossfire of their parents' disputes or feel the weight of expectations to maintain family harmony. Liu's child may have experienced similar pressures, which, when combined with academic stress, contributed to the development of depression.\n\nThe school's role in generating anxiety cannot be overlooked. The educational system often imposes rigorous schedules, leaving little room for students to relax and rejuvenate. The case of Wang, another student suffering from mild depression, highlights the detrimental effects of constant surveillance and lack of privacy within the school environment. Students need psychological safety and personal space to process their emotions. However, the ever-present monitoring in schools, justified under the guise of safety and discipline, can lead to feelings of being trapped and increase anxiety levels, making it difficult for students to concentrate and perform well academically.\n\nMoreover, the rigid educational structures often fail to accommodate individual learning needs and psychological well-being. Schools are primarily evaluated based on academic performance and safety, and this evaluation system may inadvertently contribute to a high-pressure environment. In Liu's case, her child's school environment might have lacked the necessary flexibility and support to address the unique psychological needs, further exacerbating the depression.\n\nBeyond these more predictable sources of anxiety, unexpected events such as illness, death of a loved one, or bullying can also have a profound impact on a student's mental health. Such incidents can create a sudden spike in anxiety, overwhelming the student's coping mechanisms and leading to depressive symptoms. These unexpected stressors highlight the importance of resilience-building in young people, equipping them with the skills needed to navigate life's inevitable challenges.\n\nReflecting on these insights, it becomes clear that the approach to addressing student depression must be holistic and multifaceted. Interventions should focus not only on the individual student but also on the broader systems that influence their mental health. This includes working closely with families to foster supportive home environments, collaborating with schools to create nurturing educational settings, and empowering students with strategies to manage anxiety effectively.\n\nAs clinicians, it is imperative to adopt metacognitive intervention techniques that encourage students to reflect on their thought patterns and emotional responses. By helping students develop greater self-awareness and cognitive flexibility, we can enable them to break free from the cycle of anxiety and depression. Additionally, psychoeducation for parents and teachers is crucial in reshaping their perceptions of success and well-being, promoting a balanced approach to academic and personal growth.\n\nIn conclusion, the case of Liu and her child serves as a poignant reminder of the complex interplay between external pressures and student mental health. It challenges us to broaden our understanding and deepen our empathy, recognizing that each student's journey is unique. Through comprehensive and compassionate care, we can support students in overcoming depression and thriving in all aspects of their lives.", "causes": "Depression caused by academic stress in high school", "symptoms": "Anorexia, social withdrawal, sleep disorder, suicidal tendency", "treatment_process": "Acceptance and listening: relationship building;\n Metacognitive Intervention Techniques: Help students break the cycle of anxiety and depression by increasing self-awareness and cognitive flexibility.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Parents' high expectations and the pressure of academic competition in school lead to depression in high school students.", "treatment_effect": "Through the use of metacognitive intervention techniques, students are encouraged to reflect on their thinking patterns and emotional responses, helping them to improve their self-awareness and cognitive flexibility so as to escape from the vicious cycle of anxiety and depression.

While standing on a suspended platform in the middle of the cave and looking down, he suddenly experienced symptoms of a panic attack. His limbs went numb, his heart raced, he struggled to breathe, and he became unsteady on his feet. With the help of his family, he managed to exit the cave and was hospitalized for treatment. Later, he developed a series of symptoms, repeatedly worrying about his heartbeat, undergoing more than 30 medical examinations, feeling anxious, and experiencing pain in various parts of his body, including rib pain, back pain, shoulder pain, and scalp pain. He cannot bear to hear negative news and is afraid to drive. Medical examinations found no organic issues, and he has been hospitalized for treatment before."], "consultation_process": ["First consultation: Describe the process of the first panic attack (in an underground cave) and the second one (in an underground supermarket), as well as the subsequent hospital treatment and psychological counseling experiences (one session of hypnosis therapy and one session of psychological counseling); describe current physical symptoms, mainly anxiety and worry, while taking two types of anti-anxiety medications twice a day, not daring to go to the supermarket (where panic attacks occurred), unable to hear negative information, and afraid to drink even a little alcohol (previously able to drink half a pound), always worrying about heartbeats, constantly testing, and going to the hospital for heart checks; describe a simple childhood experience. Second consultation: Learn that the parents are cinema employees, discuss the early experiences of watching horror movies, and relate the scenes of horror movies to underground caves, exploring commonalities; discuss the meaning behind the symptoms, accept the symptoms, using heartbeat as an example, converse with the organs, treating them like a mischievous child, where both fast and slow heartbeats are loved just like one loves their four-year-old daughter. Third consultation: Continue gathering information about childhood, grew up at the foot of a mountain, a carefree childhood spent playing with peers all day, with little parental restriction; also learned about a significant scalding incident at age seven, accidentally pouring a pot of hot water over oneself while playing, feeling both pain and itch, and being wrapped in a shirt to be taken to the hospital. Fourth consultation: Understand recent symptoms, interpret the patterns of neurosis symptoms in counseling: they repeatedly appear but overall intensity diminishes; explore systematic desensitization therapy, discussing the five stages that need desensitization; propose a connection between the childhood scalding incident and panic attacks, explaining the principle of panic attacks resembling nightmares. Fifth consultation: Discuss the practice of the first stage of systematic desensitization (going to the supermarket with family), continue to the second stage of systematic desensitization (going to the supermarket alone); use the \"lid theory\" to visualize and interpret the symptoms that still frequently appear in counseling, aiding in accepting the symptoms; use rational emotive therapy to interpret events in life; assign homework. Sixth consultation: Continue discussing symptoms, discussing the understanding and recognition of the \"lid theory\"; discuss the second stage of systematic desensitization (going to the supermarket alone), as preparation for going to Huainan, propose the third stage of systematic desensitization (driving anxiety); establish the counseling relationship, discuss the issue of halving medication. Seventh consultation: The counseling relationship stabilizes, medication is halved, discuss the next steps for reducing medication; continue discussing symptoms, explore how the self benefits from symptoms, controls loved ones, and satisfies inner desires for control; reflect on the incident of not leaving the daughter in the park but taking her to a 4S shop, where the daughter cried, using rational emotive therapy thinking to discuss. Eighth consultation: Symptoms change, anxiety and worry become stable, realize that I no longer focus intensely on my heartbeat, nor do I check it anymore; continue to explore systematic desensitization, consolidate the first two stages, implement the third stage, guide coping with anxiety when driving to Bengbu and Huainan; since this is a voice consultation, starting from this time, as per the client's request, a brief summary of the consultation will be sent via text message after each session. Ninth consultation: Appointments start being on time, no longer contacting in advance, significantly reducing the need to control the therapist, previously always dominating the changes in appointment times, indicating a weakening control over the surrounding environment; discuss symptoms, symptoms change, no longer worried about heartbeats, no longer testing, symptoms shift to rib pain. The client expresses some concern, the therapist explains using the \"inner straw theory,\" which the client finds easier to accept; replace subconscious benefits from symptoms with marital harmony, children's happy growth, and a warm family. The client gives feedback, feeling very confident about the neurosis symptoms. Tenth consultation: Provide specific guidance for driving to Hefei, practice the fourth stage of systematic desensitization, successfully cope; continue discussing reducing medication, respect the client's method of reducing medication casually and slowly, sometimes forgetting to take it; review and summarize previous consultations, through reinterpreting the \"lid theory\" and \"straw theory,\" accept changes in symptoms, and enhance understanding of symptoms; gather two childhood fear memories: one is being submerged underwater while helping a peer by a bigger boy. The second is swimming with an inner tube, feeling scared when it started to leak as I neared the shore. Eleventh to fifteenth consultations: Briefly summarized. Sixteenth consultation: New changes in symptoms appear, rib pain and general aches shift to migraines, especially experiencing unexplained diarrhea, up to ten times a day; I interpret this as the concentrated release of psychological conflict into the body, a more effective way than panic attacks, while using the \"anti-bandit theory\" to help the client understand; explore views on thought-shifting tasks, the client can use thought-shifting concepts to cope with people and events in life; medication reduction is implemented, from two types twice a day to one type once a day, three pills each time, increasing confidence in reducing medication. Seventeenth consultation: Starting from this session, systematically organize and repair related psychological conflicts; symptom intensity sharply decreases, pain symptoms disappear, sometimes feeling like an ordinary person, experiencing unprecedented feelings; one night, feeling an urge to explode, I used concepts and methods from the counseling process to cope, naturally falling asleep, truly accepting the symptoms; through intentional dialogue, guide the client to revisit the process of being burned at age seven, focusing on describing everything seen in the burn department, reconstructing the client’s emotional memories, then attributing new, positive meanings. Eighteenth consultation: In terms of symptoms, the client experienced some during a two-day trip to Nanjing and Changzhou but was able to cope; continue through intentional dialogue, guiding the client to recount the process of being burned at age seven, focusing on expressing everything seen in the burn department, reconstructing the emotional memories. Nineteenth consultation: Current symptoms are present when thought of, but not felt when not thought of; repair parent-child concepts, communicate about matters related to the daughter, shift views on family education, master scientific educational methods, allowing parent-child interactions to become a source of joy, with the daughter becoming the client’s “therapist”; discuss further reduction of medication, reducing from one pill once a day to half a pill once a day. Twentieth consultation: One night, the client experienced severe scalp pain lasting several seconds, which was alleviated through self-regulation and sleep; implement interaction between the client and child, actively take the child to play in the square, and play darts at home, experiencing the joy of interacting with the child, no longer viewing child-rearing as solely a mother’s responsibility; through relaxation methods, help the client return to the scene of the burn at age seven, reconstructing the emotional memories associated with the burn, then attributing new, positive meanings. Twenty-first consultation: Reinterpret and reposition panic attacks, noting that the conditions of the client's attacks do not align with the unpredictability of panic attacks, lacking a definite background and intrinsic characteristics. The client’s attacks have common situational elements, involving downward processes, enclosed spaces, and the presence of others. The attacks can be viewed as the release of suppressed fears from the subconscious in specific situations, which can be identified as agoraphobia; use empty chair technique to mend mother-child relationships, guiding the client to dialogue with the mother, with the therapist acting as the mother, releasing suppressed control and anger; continue exploring the issue of reducing medication, agreeing to reduce the medication to a quarter of a pill each time. Twenty-second consultation: The client and cousin drank ten bottles of beer without feeling any abnormalities, while previously the client hadn't drunk a single bottle in three years and even felt scared talking about alcohol; the client believes that if they can drink like before, they will be normal again; when discussing the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law relationship, explore mending that relationship, reinterpreting it through the \"pipeline processing theory,\" changing the client's role from observer in the relationship to an active participant; start working on separation tasks, beginning to summarize the first five consultations. Twenty-third consultation: Insist on morning runs for a week; due to the sister's strict demands on the child, mend the controlling and counter-controlling relationship with the sister. The sister is as dominant as the mother, with the client feeling controlled by the sister at a conscious level, while the subconscious controls the sister through symptoms, exploring substitutes for symptoms; summarize consultations six to ten, reinforcing the effectiveness of counseling; the client begins to think that the quarter pill daily seems ineffective. Twenty-fourth consultation: Insist on morning runs for the second week, and also engage in gardening and fish-keeping, feeling very busy; I suggest this reminds me of someone, the client’s father, and explore the seldom-speaking father's role in the family, which is no less than that of the mother, surprising the client, offering explanations from the perspective of family dynamics; continue summarizing consultations eleven to sixteen, gradually verifying the patterns of neurosis symptoms in counseling, reinforcing the effectiveness of counseling; no longer discussing medication. Twenty-fifth consultation: The client chatted with their cousin under a big bridge, discussing a relative who was hospitalized with lung cancer, making the client feel uneasy; at that time, they received a call from their sister (with stomach pain), on the way back on the motorcycle and for the next two days, symptoms fully rebounded, including scalp pain, back pain, and overall weakness. The client inquired whether symptoms had relapsed; the therapist's affirmation is crucial, explaining: \"That's great, they finally appeared,\" indicating subconscious anxiety about separation, explaining: 1. This situation should have appeared two weeks prior during the separation in the counseling relationship. 2. After three years of companionship, when leaving, a handshake or farewell is necessary, reflecting the inertia of physiological symptoms. 3. The final exposure of residual hiding, leading to ultimate elimination. 4. Even occasional visits can be warmly welcomed; the client begins to take the initiative in household chores. Twenty-sixth consultation: The client reports symptoms over the past three days that have never occurred before; during these three days, the symptoms include rib, back, and scalp pains occurring intermittently, yet their emotions remain relatively stable, feeling confident about the symptoms; the therapist’s response is that they are particularly curious about what other tricks the pains might have; summarize the mending work from consultations seventeen to twenty-four, consolidating effects. The client summarizes: From seeking hospitals (37 heart checks) → to seeking a psychiatrist (head of a psychiatric hospital) → to seeking a counselor → to seeking themselves. Starting from this consultation, the counseling schedule is changed to once every two weeks, then three weeks, once a month, and follow-ups every three months and six months. Twenty-seventh consultation: Report changes over the past two weeks, feeling very happy, experiencing feelings never felt in three years, all symptoms have disappeared, unable to imagine returning to normal, no symptoms even when drunk, no longer anxious when driving, feeling free to go wherever; the therapist provides a comprehensive and simple summary using three metaphors to address the stubbornness, strength, changes, and recurrence of symptoms, using eight consultations to fully mend and resolve psychological conflicts; the client expresses gratitude for the counseling, noting that the anxiety counseling discussed online was ineffective, likely due to a lack of trust in the relationship. The client narrates that the changes are multifaceted; they often recall a segment from previous counseling or something said by the therapist, finding it reasonable, summarizing that they previously controlled too much but can now work and live calmly, with harmonious family relationships, and the child becoming their greatest source of comfort and joy. Twenty-eighth consultation: The client reports on their life situation over the past three weeks, feeling fulfilled and happy, having a good relationship with family, often playing happily with the child, and no longer feeling so anxious about events in life; jointly review and summarize symptoms, finding them not complicated at all, coming because of needs, and leaving because of gains; the client suggests monthly consultations moving forward, while the therapist recommends adhering to the established schedule, completing all sessions, and being able to schedule consultations as needed. Twenty-ninth consultation: Symptoms completely disappeared within the month, feeling no concern about them, fully able to cope; the relationship with the mother has changed significantly, as the mother used to worry about the client needing her money, but now often gives the client pocket money and even offers her savings of 150,000 to help with the mortgage; the client mentions having a bit of a temper, which they are aware of and actively adjusting, and the therapist suggests using rational emotive therapy and thought-shifting concepts practiced in counseling to cope. The counseling ended in late November 2014, and by 2016, it had been 14 months. Work and life are normal, family is harmonious, and parent-child relationships are harmonious."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on this comprehensive journey of psychotherapy with a client who initially presented with an anxiety disorder, it is evident that the path to recovery is both intricate and deeply rewarding. The journey from debilitating neurosis to emotional stability and personal growth offers profound insights into the therapeutic process, the client's resilience, and the transformative power of psychotherapy. This reflection seeks to explore these dimensions in greater detail, drawing upon the extensive consultations and the therapeutic techniques employed throughout the case.\n\nInitially, the client presented with intense anxiety symptoms that manifested as physical pain and a pervasive fear of certain situations. These symptoms were deeply rooted in past experiences and exacerbated by cognitive patterns that reinforced anxiety. The recovery process was significantly bolstered by psychological counseling, which proved to be the cornerstone of the client's rehabilitation. The use of psychoanalysis enabled an exploration of the subconscious mind, uncovering fears and traumas that had been suppressed for years. By revisiting and reconstructing emotional memories, particularly those related to childhood traumas such as the scalding incident, the client was able to reframe these experiences and reduce their psychological impact.\n\nOne of the core insights gleaned from this case is the realization that psychological counseling extends far beyond mere symptom relief. It facilitates a holistic transformation, enabling clients to rebuild their identity and relationships. For this client, the therapeutic journey included mending familial bonds, particularly with the mother and sister, which were previously characterized by control and counter-control dynamics. The application of techniques such as the empty chair dialogue allowed the client to express and process suppressed emotions, leading to healthier and more supportive relationships.\n\nMoreover, the case underscores the importance of systematic desensitization in addressing specific phobias and anxiety triggers. By gradually exposing the client to anxiety-provoking situations, such as visiting supermarkets or driving, the therapy helped dismantle the conditioned fear responses. This technique was crucial in empowering the client to reclaim their autonomy and navigate daily life with confidence. The progression through the stages of desensitization was marked by a significant reduction in medication, which was carefully managed to ensure the client's comfort and safety.\n\nAnother pivotal aspect of the therapy was the exploration of the client's internal narratives and the substitution of symptom-driven benefits with healthier sources of fulfillment. The client's initial reliance on symptoms to exert control over their environment and relationships was gradually replaced by positive interactions and a harmonious family life. This shift was facilitated by the introduction of rational emotive therapy and thought-shifting techniques, which equipped the client with tools to reinterpret life events and reduce emotional distress.\n\nThe therapeutic process also highlighted the necessity for patience and persistence in overcoming neurosis. The fluctuations in symptom intensity, such as the transition from heart-focused anxiety to rib pain and eventually to migraines, were indicative of the complex nature of psychological healing. The therapeutic environment provided a safe space for the client to express fears and explore new coping strategies, ultimately leading to a profound sense of self-discovery and empowerment.\n\nThroughout the consultations, the role of the therapeutic relationship emerged as a critical factor in the client's recovery. Trust and rapport between the therapist and client facilitated open communication and a willingness to engage in introspective work. This relationship also allowed for the exploration of deeper psychological conflicts, such as the client's fear of separation and dependency issues, which were addressed through intentional dialogue and guided self-reflection.\n\nThe process of reducing medication was carefully synchronized with therapeutic progress, emphasizing the importance of integrating pharmacological and psychological interventions. This approach minimized dependency on medication while promoting sustainable mental health improvements. The client's eventual decision to taper off medication reflected their growing confidence and self-efficacy, further reinforced by therapeutic achievements.\n\nIn conclusion, this case exemplifies the transformative potential of psychological counseling for individuals with anxiety disorders. The multifaceted nature of therapy, encompassing symptom relief, emotional healing, and personal growth, highlights the profound impact of psychotherapy. The insights gained from this case underscore the urgency of promoting psychological counseling to a broader audience, ensuring that individuals struggling with similar challenges can access effective and compassionate care.

Consultation Process: At 7 AM, the visitor mentioned feeling a bit uncomfortable and wanted to continue the consultation from yesterday's session at 9 AM. I suggested she close her eyes, relax, and visualize what this discomfort felt like in her mind, then draw it out. However, in the afternoon, she only wrote a brief diary entry, stating that she didn't want to draw and felt increasingly uncomfortable. Her diary entry read: After dropping off the kids in the morning, I dozed off for a while, didn't tidy up the house, and around ten, I checked Taobao. When I went out to pick up the kids at noon, I felt fine, didn't think about anything, and chatted with other parents. After lunch, the kids played on their phones and I looked at Taobao again. Someone online asked me how to sell succulents (potted plants) because I didn't want to keep them anymore and was planning to sell them online. Basically, these were the things (the visitor seemed to avoid addressing her own discomfort!). Since the consultation ended yesterday, she has been engulfed in negative emotions about her husband. Just thinking about how he doesn't understand how to care for his wife makes her feel upset and wronged. The visitor analyzed the reasons for her discomfort this morning: first, being alone at home without anyone to keep her company made her want to forget her loneliness, but the more she thought about it, the more it seemed to reinforce her obsessive thinking. Second, it was related to the topic discussed about her husband yesterday; third, she felt a lack of achievement from being a housewife over the years.", "We discussed the issue of children's education again. She mentioned that children raised by women tend to lack confidence, while she observed that some fathers working in her unit, who were raising their children, had kids that were particularly confident, bold, and open-minded, developing in various ways. Her husband's workplace was doing quite well, and he had recently been promoted to a good position, which gave him a bit of a sense of superiority. Her husband has always been clean but is a bit stubborn. The visitor hopes her husband would treat her like a little woman and wishes for more interaction between her husband and their son, ideally like friends! However, her husband sets too many restrictions and rules for the child, and it seems their son doesn't enjoy being with his father. Whenever she discusses something with her husband, if he says he is busy, it frustrates her, and she acknowledges that her own temperament isn't good either. The visitor also shared the difference between tolerance and patience, stating that she isn't tolerant but more inclined to retreat. Retreating essentially means not solving the problem but merely taking a step back. She feels she has retreated in front of her in-laws because she was raised to respect the elderly and honor her parents. The visitor shared a side story about the first time she took the initiative to comfort her husband. I immediately enriched this side story, prompting the visitor to compare this \"slightly more proactive\" communication style with her previous patterns and how it impacted their relationship. The visitor said, \"Previously, I would get angry and throw a tantrum, but as long as my husband gently comforted me, we would reconcile! This time, I took the initiative to apologize to him and express my feelings to improve our relationship.\" Through this comparison, the visitor gained more insight into her and her husband's emotional needs and their inappropriate communication patterns. She recognized more of her husband's strengths: he is hardworking, patient, clean, and self-sufficient, and he has never been violent with her. Although he tends to be a bit nagging, he still has many virtues. She desires her husband to be a strong man, while he longs for a warm and romantic wife, both wanting the other to express love first. I also pointed out how her husband makes her delicious meals every time he comes home, helping the visitor see the goodwill behind his actions.", "8.

By the end of the consultation, there was a noticeable decrease in the client's anxiety and an increase in their confidence."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on the therapeutic journey with this client, I am struck by the complexity of her emotional landscape and the intricacies of her interpersonal relationships. Our primary goal has been to address her anxiety, particularly her separation anxiety, which manifests in various forms, such as physical symptoms and relational tensions. The client’s history of postpartum depression and her ongoing struggle with anxiety highlight the necessity of a careful, nuanced approach in therapy. Narrative Therapy has served as a valuable framework, enabling us to explore and reconstruct her life stories.\n\nInitially, the consultation focused on understanding the client's emotional distress and its connection to her life circumstances. Her description of symptoms like chest tightness, dizziness, and hand tremors was not just a physical manifestation of anxiety but also a reflection of her inner turmoil and sense of being overwhelmed by her roles and relationships. This prompted us to explore the narratives surrounding her identity as a housewife, a mother, and a wife, and how these roles contributed to her anxiety.\n\nOne significant aspect of our sessions was the exploration of her relationship with her husband. The client often felt misunderstood and unsupported by him, which exacerbated her feelings of loneliness and fear. The narrative approach allowed us to delve into her perceptions and expectations within the marriage. We discussed her longing for a more romantic and intimate connection with her husband, contrasting with his tendency to be practical and somewhat rigid in his interactions.\n\nThroughout the sessions, I encouraged the client to examine not only her husband's shortcomings but also his strengths and contributions to their family life. This shift in perspective was crucial in helping her recognize the goodwill behind his actions, such as preparing meals for the family. This act of care, while seemingly mundane, was a profound expression of his desire to nurture the family and maintain a harmonious environment, which the client began to appreciate more deeply over time.\n\nAn important turning point in therapy was when the client took the initiative to comfort her husband, breaking the longstanding pattern of communication in their marriage. This act signified a shift from passive to active engagement in their relationship, fostering a deeper understanding and connection between them. It was a testament to the client’s growing self-awareness and her willingness to embrace change, which was a significant step towards enhancing her emotional resilience.\n\nIn reflecting on the process, I realize the importance of patience and the careful pacing of therapy. Anxiety, particularly when intertwined with familial and marital dynamics, requires a gentle, supportive approach. The client’s initial reluctance to confront her emotions was a protective mechanism, and respecting this boundary was essential to building trust and facilitating gradual change. Forcing confrontation might have led to further distress, underscoring the need to strengthen her inner resources before tackling deeper emotional issues.\n\nThe client’s reflections on her role as a housewife and mother also provided rich material for narrative exploration. She expressed feelings of inadequacy and a lack of personal achievement, which were compounded by societal and familial expectations. By revisiting and reframing these narratives, we aimed to empower her to see the value in her contributions and to cultivate a sense of self-worth independent of external validation. This process involved identifying and nurturing her strengths, which were often overshadowed by her focus on perceived shortcomings.\n\nOur discussions frequently returned to the theme of loneliness and how it intertwined with her anxiety. Living in an urban environment, separated from her extended family and support network, amplified these feelings. We explored ways in which she could build connections and find fulfillment outside her immediate family roles. This included fostering friendships, pursuing interests, and perhaps engaging in activities that could provide a sense of accomplishment and community.\n\nThe client’s relationship with her son also emerged as a significant focus. Her concerns about his confidence and development, particularly in comparison to children raised by fathers, reflected her anxieties about her own parenting. We worked on reshaping this narrative by recognizing her strengths as a mother and identifying opportunities for her to support her son’s growth in ways that aligned with her values and aspirations for him.\n\nThrough narrative therapy, we continuously sought to identify and enrich the client’s sub-stories, allowing her to gradually rewrite the dominant narratives in her life. This involved highlighting moments of resilience, connection, and growth, helping her to construct a more empowering and hopeful life story. The process of narrative reconstruction was not about negating her struggles but about integrating them into a broader context of personal development and relational healing.\n\nThe consultation process also highlighted the importance of addressing the client’s beliefs about authenticity and uncertainty. Her interpretations of her anxiety, whether linked to her past experiences or current relationships, were valid and real for her at that moment. By respecting and exploring these narratives, we opened up space for new insights and possibilities. This approach required a delicate balance of curiosity, empathy, and support, acknowledging the fluid and evolving nature of her self-understanding.\n\nReflecting on my role as a therapist, I am mindful of the potential impact of my actions and the resources I provide to the client. For instance, sharing the article on self-care and boundaries was intended to empower her but also required careful consideration of how it might influence her perceptions and decisions. This underscores the ethical responsibility to support clients in a way that respects their autonomy and individual journey.\n\nIn conclusion, the therapeutic journey with this client has been one of gradual unfolding and deepening understanding. By focusing on narrative reconstruction, we have begun to transform her relationship with anxiety and her interpersonal dynamics, paving the way for continued growth and healing. The process has reaffirmed the power of narrative therapy in helping clients navigate complex emotional landscapes and construct more fulfilling life stories. As we continue this journey, the emphasis will remain on fostering resilience, connection, and a sense of agency in the face of life's uncertainties.", "causes": "Anxiety and somatization symptoms due to loneliness and conjugal tension.", "symptoms": "Chest tightness and shortness of breath, anxiety and tension.", "treatment_process": "Acceptance and listening: building relationships;\n Narrative therapy: By allowing the visitor to reconstruct the narrative, improve her sense of self-worth, re-examine her husband's strengths and weaknesses, improve her husband's relationship with , and alleviate her anxiety Symptoms.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Anxiety accompanied by somatization symptoms such as chest tightness and shortness of breath.", "treatment_effect": "Through narrative reconstruction, the visitor's relationship with her husband and her sense of self-worth were changed, and the visitor's psychological resilience was improved, paving the way for her continued growth and recovery."}

If this payment cannot be recovered on time, it will directly affect the normal operation of my husband's business and could even put the company's development or survival in jeopardy. After this incident, the company has followed the procedures and filed a lawsuit with the court, but there has been no outcome so far. Throughout this entire process, my husband has not engaged in any illegal or improper conduct, so the company's leadership has not expressed any criticism or complaints about his handling of the situation.", "However, my husband finds it hard to let go of this matter. He exhausts himself day and night thinking about it, but he still hasn't come up with a solution, which has caused his mood to gradually become irritable.

He often wakes up at two or three in the morning, and if he can't sleep, he calls me to talk. However, most of what he talks about is how miserable and suffering he feels, and he often says that life is meaningless and that death would be a release.

This case has prompted me to re-examine not only the clinical techniques I employed but also the broader implications of psychological distress in a world where economic pressures and professional responsibilities weigh heavily on individuals. \n\nThe client's situation is emblematic of the psychological burden faced by many in high-pressure careers. His dedication to his role as the head of the sales department, while commendable, also illustrates the potential for occupational stress to spill over into personal life, creating a cycle of anxiety and depression. His experience with the financial debacle involving the overseas client underscores how unforeseen professional setbacks can precipitate a crisis of self-worth and efficacy. This leads me to ponder the psychological constructs of identity and self-esteem, particularly how they are often intertwined with professional success. \n\nIn examining the details of his case, I am reminded of the delicate balance between professional ambition and personal well-being. The client’s relentless pursuit of excellence and the subsequent failure to recover a significant payment resulted in a profound sense of personal failure and inadequacy. This situation highlights the importance of fostering resilience and a healthy self-concept that is not solely dependent on external achievements. It is crucial for individuals to cultivate an internal sense of worth that can withstand the vicissitudes of professional life.\n\nThe client's initial presentation, marked by irritability, insomnia, and feelings of hopelessness, is a classic manifestation of depressive neurosis. His symptoms were exacerbated by his inability to reconcile his perceived failure with his self-image as a successful and competent professional. This cognitive dissonance is a critical area for therapeutic intervention, as it can fuel a downward spiral of negative thoughts and behaviors. The \"Carrot and Stick Comprehensive Therapy,\" rooted in \"Xingyi Psychology and the Comprehensive Therapy of Combining Authority with Kindness,\" provided a framework for addressing these maladaptive thought patterns and behaviors.\n\nAs I reflect on the therapeutic process, the importance of empathy and understanding in building a therapeutic alliance becomes evident. The client's vacillation between recognizing his irrational fears and succumbing to them illustrates the internal struggle many individuals face when grappling with psychological distress. Our sessions focused on creating a safe space for him to explore these emotions without judgment, encouraging him to articulate his fears and anxieties openly. This approach was crucial in helping him feel heard and understood, laying the groundwork for deeper therapeutic work.\n\nThe role of family support in the therapeutic process cannot be overstated. The involvement of the client's wife was instrumental in providing a supportive environment conducive to healing. Her understanding of his situation and her willingness to participate in the therapeutic process facilitated a sense of solidarity and reassurance for the client. This case reinforces the need for therapists to engage family members in the treatment process, as their support can significantly enhance the client's journey towards recovery.\n\nA critical aspect of the therapeutic intervention was helping the client to develop new cognitive frameworks to reinterpret his experiences. Encouraging him to engage in outdoor activities and to gradually alter his perceptions was aimed at fostering a sense of agency and control over his life. This therapeutic goal aligns with the principles of cognitive restructuring, which seeks to replace distorted thinking patterns with more adaptive ones. It is a reminder of the power of cognitive interventions in transforming an individual's outlook and emotional well-being.\n\nReflecting on the client's journey, I am reminded of the resilience of the human spirit. Despite the depths of his despair, he demonstrated a capacity for introspection and a desire to overcome his challenges. His gradual progress serves as a testament to the effectiveness of psychotherapy in addressing deep-seated psychological issues. It also underscores the importance of patience and persistence in the therapeutic process, as meaningful change often occurs incrementally.\n\nThis case has enriched my understanding of the complex interplay between external stressors and internal psychological states. It has reinforced my belief in the necessity of a holistic approach to therapy, one that considers the multifaceted nature of human experience. As a clinician, I am continually inspired by the courage and resilience of my clients, and I am committed to supporting them in their journey towards healing and self-discovery.\n\nThe experience of working with this client has also prompted me to reflect on my own professional development. Over the years, I have cultivated a deep appreciation for the nuances of psychological therapy and the art of balancing authority with kindness. This case has reaffirmed the value of an empathetic and client-centered approach, while also challenging me to refine my therapeutic techniques to better meet the diverse needs of those I serve.\n\nIn conclusion, this case of depressive neurosis has been a profound learning experience, reinforcing the complexities of human psychology and the transformative potential of psychotherapy. It has deepened my commitment to advancing the field of psychology, fostering a therapeutic environment where clients can explore their innermost thoughts and emotions, and ultimately, achieve a sense of peace and fulfillment in their lives.", "causes": "Unexpected career setbacks and stress leading to depression.", "symptoms": "Insomnia, temper tantrums, decreased appetite and libido, social avoidance, suicidal ideation.", "treatment_process": "Empathy and understanding: Establishing a trusting relationship;\n Rational emotive therapy: The counselor helps the client to realize that his emotional problems are caused by irrational beliefs (fear of failure), and to develop resilience and a healthy self-concept by changing the irrational beliefs;", "characteristics_of_illness": "Depressive symptoms of irritability, insomnia, and hopelessness caused by stressful events at work.", "treatment_effect": "Through rational emotive therapy, the client was helped to develop a new cognitive framework for reinterpreting his experiences, enhancing his subjectivity and sense of control over his life."}
{"id": 111, "case_description": ["Channeling emotional energy changes the interaction pattern."], "consultation_process": ["Weichen, 30 years old, was supposed to be a bride this year, but now it seems that this plan might fall through. The problem does not lie with the couple in love, but with Weichen's mother. Regarding the bride price, the wedding's scale, the location and size of the wedding house, and the price of the car, she has set very harsh conditions for the groom's side. If any of these conditions are not met, she will not agree to the marriage. Weichen knows that her mother wants her to have a better life, but such explicit pricing has truly hurt her self-esteem. It has also damaged her relationship with her boyfriend, and his parents have looked down on her and her family because of it. They believe that while it is acceptable for the bride's side to make some material demands, it should not be as unreasonable as her family’s expectations, treating the marriage as a business deal. Weichen is not new to her mother’s strong-handedness. Since she started dating, her mother has insisted that she must bring her partner to meet her immediately, but nearly every time, she found fault, believing that no one was worthy of her daughter. Now that Weichen has finally found a boyfriend she likes, her mother has made these demands. The situation has now come to a standstill, with Weichen's mother refusing to budge. Although her boyfriend has said he would try to meet her demands, his parents do not want to be led around. If they comply this time, it would set a precedent that would make things difficult for their son in the future. In fact, Weichen, caught in the middle, is the one who finds it hardest. Just after the recent May Day holiday, she was supposed to attend two weddings, one of a colleague and one of a neighbor who is also a classmate, but she didn't go to either, as she really wasn't in the mood. If it weren't for her mother's harsh material demands on her boyfriend, she would have been a bride this year. But now, everything has become uncertain. She doesn't even know what standards her mother used to set these conditions. First, the house must be in the Heping District, over 100 square meters, and it cannot be a second-hand house. Her mother said that living in a second-hand house after marriage is unlucky. Second, she won’t consider a car that costs less than 300,000 yuan because she thinks there is no essential difference between a car worth 100,000 yuan and one worth several thousand. Third, the bride price is set at 160,000 yuan, for the sake of good fortune. Finally, the wedding must be held in a five-star hotel, with a minimum of 5,000 yuan per table. Besides these major points, her mother has listed many other requirements, such as the wedding ring needing to be over 2 carats and the wedding dress costing over 10,000 yuan, etc. On the day when both families met to discuss the wedding, unexpectedly, her mother took out a list outlining these demands. At that moment, her boyfriend and his parents' expressions changed. Weichen and her father were also restless. Her mother didn’t even give her a heads-up and directly put a price tag on her. Although the words were harsh, it was essentially the truth. As a result, the meeting ended abruptly, and none of the important matters were discussed. Her boyfriend's father said that they had an urgent matter to attend to at home. This was clearly an excuse, and it was obvious they had their thoughts on the matter. If it were me, I would have thoughts too. Her boyfriend was in a dilemma, unable to leave or stay. She quickly signaled him to take his parents home. It was better that they left; if they stayed, who knows what her mother might demand next. On the way back, her mother complained a lot, saying that they didn’t take her seriously, that they could just leave at such an important occasion. Weichen said it was her mother's fault, and her mother immediately retorted that she was being foolish. Her mother did this to prevent the groom's family from easily marrying her off without effort. If things come too easily, they won’t cherish them. She wanted them to see her in a better light. What was the result? They not only didn’t see her in a better light, but they looked down on her even more. Later, her boyfriend expressed that he would try to meet her mother’s requirements, but he hoped she could persuade her mother not to be so rigid. However, his parents disagreed. They believed that while it is acceptable for the bride’s side to make specific requests during marriage, it should be based on mutual respect, considering the feelings and actual circumstances of both parties. Her mother has gone too far by listing a price list; this is no longer just a negotiation but a business deal. This disrespects both herself and others. It’s not a matter of having more or less money, but rather a difference in values between the two families; they are fundamentally from two different worlds. Therefore, they are now left questioning whether the marriage will happen. Weichen’s mother has also been unable to persuade her. She has always been authoritative over Weichen, a trait that has persisted since Weichen can remember. Her father has hardly any say in their family; her mother is the absolute authority. Her mother could even make decisions for her grandparents; the arrangements for the two families' houses were all managed by her. She has been responsible for both major and minor matters, so she has been quite exhausted over the years. That day, her mother even joked that her father seemed to be growing younger, like a young man, unlike her, who is aging faster than anyone. Of course, her father seems younger; he is not burdened by any worries and spends his days tending to his flowers and plants. So, Weichen cannot count on her father for help, and she even thinks he might be afraid of her mother. But no matter what she says, her mother does not listen. Weichen knows her mother means well, wanting her to have a good life after marriage. But the problem is, her understanding of a good life is completely different from her mother's. Her mother thinks living in a big house, driving a nice car, and being a wealthy wife equates to a good life. They have debated this issue many times, and each time, her mother would directly counter her arguments. In fact, it’s not the first time Weichen has faced her mother’s rebuttals; this time, however, it’s the harshest because it concerns marriage. In the past, none of her boyfriends ever reached the stage of discussing marriage. Of course, her mother is part of the reason for that. Weichen's first relationship was in college, and when her mother found out, she insisted that Weichen bring him home to meet her. At that time, she was not even 20 and could not possibly think about marriage, so there was no need to meet the parents. As a result, her mother claimed that he lacked sincerity. In any case, they eventually broke up, and while she cannot attribute the entire responsibility to her mother, it was certainly a contributing factor. Later, whenever Weichen had a boyfriend, her mother insisted that she show him to her immediately. But her mother would look down on everyone and pick out faults. Over time, Weichen ended up delaying things until now. Now that she has finally found a boyfriend her mother has somewhat accepted, this situation has arisen. Being caught between both families is truly an uncomfortable experience. Other people's parents are urging them to marry, while her mother is the opposite. I am turning 30 this year; doesn’t she fear that I might become an aging leftover woman?"], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on Weichen's case provides a profound insight into the intricate dynamics between familial expectations and personal autonomy, a theme that frequently surfaces in psychotherapy, particularly within the context of Chinese cultural norms. The core issue in this case revolves around Weichen's struggle with her mother's domineering influence over her life decisions, especially concerning her marriage. This is not merely a familial disagreement but a broader commentary on how deeply rooted cultural values and personal identity can clash, leading to significant emotional distress.\n\nWeichen's mother has long exerted a strong influence over her, a pattern established since childhood. This pattern has manifested in various ways, from dictating Weichen's romantic engagements to setting exorbitant demands for her marriage. It is crucial to acknowledge that while Weichen's mother believes she is acting in her daughter's best interest, this perceived benevolence translates into control that stifles Weichen's autonomy. This dynamic is emblematic of many familial relationships where the line between care and control blurs, leading to an unhealthy dependency and an erosion of personal boundaries.\n\nFrom a clinical perspective, this case underscores the importance of understanding the cultural context in which these familial interactions occur. In many Asian cultures, there is a strong emphasis on filial piety and family honor, which can lead to parents wielding considerable power over their children's life choices. Weichen's situation exemplifies this, where her mother's demands are not just personal whims but are deeply tied to cultural notions of status, success, and family reputation.\n\nWeichen's internal conflict can be attributed to her awareness of this cultural expectation juxtaposed with her desire for personal freedom and happiness. This tension is evident in her reflections on her mother's actions, recognizing both the intention of care and the resultant harm. The first step in addressing this is to facilitate Weichen's realization that autonomy does not equate to disrespect or disobedience, but rather a necessary step towards self-actualization and authentic living.\n\nIn therapeutic practice, helping Weichen navigate this path requires a delicate balance. It is essential to validate her feelings of frustration and hurt while also exploring the underlying fears and dependencies that bind her to her mother's will. One possible approach is to help Weichen develop a stronger sense of self, separate from her mother's identity and expectations. This involves exploring her values, desires, and goals, independent of familial influence, thereby strengthening her self-efficacy and decision-making capabilities.\n\nAnother critical aspect is addressing Weichen's fear of confrontation with her mother. This fear is likely rooted in years of habitual compliance and the anxiety of potential conflict disrupting familial harmony. Cognitive-behavioral strategies could be employed to reframe her perception of these interactions, viewing them not as confrontations but as opportunities for assertive communication and boundary-setting. Role-playing scenarios in therapy could provide Weichen with the tools to express her needs clearly and confidently, reinforcing her autonomy without resorting to hostility.\n\nMoreover, the economic dimension of Weichen's relationship with her mother cannot be overlooked. Financial dependency often underpins many such power dynamics, reinforcing the control one party holds over the other. Encouraging Weichen to achieve financial independence, if not already present, would be a significant step towards diminishing this dependency. Financial autonomy would not only empower Weichen to make decisions free from economic coercion but also shift the power balance in her relationship with her mother.\n\nWeichen's emotional dependency on her mother is another layer that must be addressed. This dependency, stemming from a desire for maternal approval and love, suggests a possible internalized belief that autonomy and maternal affection are mutually exclusive. Therapy could focus on helping Weichen disentangle these beliefs, reinforcing the understanding that it is possible to maintain a loving relationship while asserting one's independence. This may involve exploring past interactions and experiences that shaped her current beliefs, helping her to reframe and redefine her relationship with her mother.\n\nFurthermore, exploring Weichen's social support system is crucial. The presence of a supportive network outside the family can provide her with alternative perspectives and emotional support, which are vital as she navigates these complex dynamics. Encouraging Weichen to engage with friends, colleagues, or support groups can provide her with a sense of belonging and validation, mitigating the emotional toll of familial discord.\n\nThe role of Weichen's boyfriend and his family in this scenario also warrants consideration. Their reactions to her mother's demands highlight a cultural and value-based clash, which adds another layer of complexity to the situation. It is vital for Weichen to engage in open communication with her partner, ensuring that their relationship remains a source of support rather than additional stress. Joint sessions could be beneficial, fostering mutual understanding and collaborative problem-solving, ultimately strengthening their bond amidst external pressures.\n\nIn retrospect, the case of Weichen is a vivid illustration of the interplay between cultural expectations, familial dynamics, and personal autonomy. It emphasizes the necessity for individuals to carve out a space for their identity amidst external pressures, a task that requires both internal strength and external support. As therapists, our role is to facilitate this journey, providing the tools and insights necessary for clients like Weichen to navigate their unique challenges, ultimately leading to a more harmonious and self-directed life.\n\nReflecting further, it is important to recognize the broader societal structures that contribute to such familial dynamics. Societal expectations and gender roles often place undue pressure on individuals to conform to certain life paths, such as marriage and career choices, which are deemed 'acceptable' or 'successful' by cultural standards. Weichen's case, with its focus on marriage, particularly highlights the gendered expectations placed on women in terms of marital success and family prestige. This adds an additional layer of complexity to her situation, as she not only grapples with her mother's demands but also with societal pressures that reinforce these expectations.\n\nIn therapy, it is crucial to validate the client's experience of these societal pressures and to explore ways to navigate them while staying true to their values and desires. This involves fostering resilience and empowering the client to challenge societal norms, thereby contributing to a broader cultural shift towards greater acceptance of diverse life choices and definitions of success.\n\nUltimately, Weichen's journey towards autonomy is not just a personal struggle but part of a larger narrative of individuals seeking to redefine their lives amidst traditional expectations. By supporting Weichen in her quest for self-determination, we contribute to a broader movement towards personal freedom and authenticity, underscoring the transformative potential of psychotherapy in effecting change at both individual and societal levels.", "causes": "Marital crisis caused by the mother's strong intervention.", "symptoms": "Dissatisfaction with mother's forcefulness and lack of courage to resist.", "treatment_process": "Empathy and understanding: Establishing a trusting relationship;\n Humanistic therapy: A client-centered approach in which the counselor helps the client to clarify the boundaries between her mother's expectations and her personal autonomy without judging her, thus enhancing her self-efficacy and decision-making ability;\n Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): to change the misconception that mother's disobedience is confrontational and to see them as opportunities for assertive communication and boundary setting.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Feelings of disempowerment due to the mother's strong control and dominance in the relationship.", "treatment_effect": "Through humanistic therapy, the visitor is helped to develop a stronger sense of self, differentiated from her mother's control and expectations, enabling her to express her needs clearly and confidently, and strengthening her autonomy without resorting to hostility."}
{"id": 112, "case_description": ["This is a perplexing case. The visitor (visitor information: female, 15 years old, third-year junior high school student, only child) mentioned that her mother stated during the appointment for consultation that her daughter suffers from moderate depression, and what confuses her is that her daughter seems to crave being depressed. Two years ago, she took her daughter to several large specialized hospitals in China, including Peking University Sixth Hospital and Tianjin An Ding Hospital, where she was diagnosed with moderate depression. She had taken antidepressants for over a month but stopped due to severe side effects. The psychiatrist at Tianjin An Ding Hospital strongly recommended that the child receive psychological counseling. Her daughter has visited several psychological clinics in Tianjin and Beijing and consulted six therapists. Among them, five male therapists couldn't elicit a single word from her daughter, while only one female therapist managed to talk with her for an hour, but her daughter said that consultation was also ineffective. Throughout the process of hospital diagnosis and psychological counseling, the daughter was very cooperative and never refused. Moreover, the daughter claimed to be very familiar with the routines of psychological counselors and felt a sense of accomplishment in successfully challenging them, even giving herself the nickname \"the killer of psychological counselors.\" The mother asked me if I was willing to take on this consultation. I replied that as long as her daughter could come to my consulting room, I would be capable of handling the psychological consultation, and if her daughter didn't speak, I would refund the entire consultation fee. The mother stated that she is a regional manager for a foreign company, and the consultation fee is not an issue, as long as the consultant can help her daughter express her thoughts. The husband has been staying home to care for their daughter and has not worked for several years. The couple has only this one daughter. The daughter's main symptoms include not going out, being unhappy all day, feeling irritable, and being unwilling to go to school, yet she performs excellently in her studies and is well-regarded by her teachers. However, the daughter self-harms on her arms every two weeks, and there are many wounds on her arms. The school teachers have reported to the parents, with the most recent incident being quite serious, and the mother had accompanied her to the hospital for stitches. The mother is worried about her daughter's safety and has brought her in for consultation."], "consultation_process": ["Consultation Objective: How to help my daughter overcome the troubles of depression?", "III. Consultation Process: When the mother and daughter walked into the consultation room, the atmosphere was not particularly awkward. The two were more playful, with the daughter's laughter being more flippant, denying that she had any psychological issues and only admitting that she was \"unhappy\"! She did not answer any other questions and mostly just said \"whatever\"! The mother was often forcing a smile, trying to comfort and cheer up her daughter. Surprisingly, the whole family of three came, and they even brought a small dog. This dog seemed to be closer to the father. When I asked the daughter if she was willing to have both parents present during the conversation, she repeatedly said \"whatever.\" In the midst of this indifference, the father took the dog and voluntarily left to walk it outside! During the first half of the consultation, the words the daughter used most often in response to questions were \"whatever\" or \"I don't know\" (who is the client in this case, I wondered?). Since the daughter was unwilling to say much, I had to ask the mother, the help-seeker in this case, to speak! The mother expressed that her greatest concern was her daughter's \"unhappiness.\" The daughter had been diagnosed with moderate depression at several major hospitals, which is quite \"serious.\" Recently, she had not been going out or attending school, and her biggest hope for the consultation was to help her daughter overcome her unhappiness.", "The mother is the regional general manager of a multinational foreign-funded enterprise. Over the years, her daughter has studied in various places and transferred from a school in Beijing to a school in Tianjin in 2015. The reason for the transfer was the child's aversion to studying, during which she took a two-month break from school at home. In the consultation, the daughter only admitted to feeling \"unhappy\" and did not talk about anything else. Fortunately, the mother was present in the consultation room, and to avoid an awkward situation, I had to find a breakthrough in the conversation with her. After nearly an hour of consultation, the girl remained silent, so I started to \"chat\" with the mother. Through this casual conversation, the girl's expression gradually relaxed. The mother inadvertently mentioned that her daughter had only one hobby: \"eating fish.\" This topic seemed to spark a bit of interest in the daughter, and she finally engaged with us. Seeing this turning point, I cautiously asked her when she started to love eating fish, what kinds she liked, and what flavors. Perhaps my curiosity and listening made her feel respected, and the daughter finally opened up! Initially, she only mentioned that she loved the grilled fish from a restaurant called \"Fish Cool,\" particularly the \"spicy lychee flavor.\" I felt our conversation was becoming more casual. However, no matter what we talked about, as long as the daughter was willing to speak with me, the consultation was already halfway successful. The mother mentioned that the daughter often felt \"unhappy\" and that \"she feels bad when others are happy,\" to which the daughter immediately countered. I said, \"That viewpoint is your mother's, not yours. I would really like to hear your perspective.\" Later, the daughter began to open up, saying she had read a book called \"Extreme Psychology.\" I became curious about why someone her age would read psychology books, what her purpose was, what she gained from it, and how she would evaluate the book! The daughter said she read psychology books just for fun, and was particularly interested in topics like pedophilia, paraphilia, mental disorders, and multiple personality disorders. She also mentioned having read many other psychology-related books (micro-expressions psychology) as well as books on other topics, indicating that this girl is both self-assured and confident in certain areas. Last Christmas, a parent gifted a Christmas tree to the whole class, and the daughter wrote a wish on the wish card to challenge a top student in her grade. In her own words: she didn't expect that with a little effort, she would succeed in the challenge and become the top student in her class. This success changed the perceptions of all her teachers and classmates. Later, the daughter took the initiative to discuss her relationship with her father! The mother said that the daughter's repressive personality was related to her father, who raised her from a young age. Until now, the mother is often out and very busy with work, spending less time caring for the family and her daughter, which may also relate to the daughter's issues. The daughter mentioned that she has never dared to cry; she said if she cried out of grievance, it would lead to trouble with her father (her father would scare her into not crying, and she said it had always been like this since she could remember). Later, the mother said that they rarely communicated while each was in their own rooms! At this point, the daughter suddenly interjected: \"Each of us in our family of three lives in our own room!\" This statement opened up another space for our dialogue, starting to shift the direction of our conversation. We began to explore the mother's anxiety, the conflicts in the parents' marriage, and the connection between their disharmonious marital relationship and the daughter's current issues. One time, while the couple was arguing fiercely in their room, the daughter suddenly pushed open the door, shocking her parents. The mother quickly feigned laughter and told the daughter that they were \"showing affection.\" The daughter was also a bit surprised by the sudden change in the scene. The mother said her marriage was just a choice made out of helplessness; at the time, she chose her husband because \"he is good to only me,\" and even now, when the mother mentions her husband's virtues, it is only this one: \"He has never cheated and has only been good to me.\" The mother also expressed that she feels her husband's goodness is merely verbal and not something she can genuinely feel, similar to how her daughter perceives her mother's love: the daughter said that rationally, she believes her mother should love her, but emotionally, she cannot feel it!", "Case Analysis: What role does the mother play in addressing her daughter's depression? In my opinion, the mother is the one who cares the most about her daughter's issues, and she has been striving to solve these problems for years. The daughter's issues have overshadowed the problems within the family and the parents' marriage. The mother claims that her daughter's problems are the biggest issue, and in order to address them, she can temporarily set aside her own problems, or rather, she has found an excuse to avoid confronting her marital issues and inner pain. Unbeknownst to her, the daughter's problems are a direct result of the issues in their marriage. If the problems in their marriage are resolved, the daughter's issues will also be resolved. Helping this mother recognize this connection and encouraging her to face and solve these problems is the key to breaking this deadlock.", "V. Reflection on the success or failure of the consultation goals: My mother said I wanted my daughter to come out of her \"unhappiness,\" but later it seemed that the one who needed the consultation the most was me, and it seemed that the consultation was being directed at me. I believe it was precisely because I did not set the consultation goals on my daughter's issues, but rather on the relationship between the client and her parents, teachers, and classmates, that our consultation's perspective became broader, allowing my mother to see the connection between my daughter's \"problems\" and the disharmony in their marital relationship.", "Sixth, reflections on the consultation process:", "As the consultation was coming to an end, our discussion returned to the topic of my daughter's \"moderate depression.\" I mentioned that the diagnostic criteria for depression are very strict and that it indicates a problem with the brain's endocrine system, which requires medication. If the medication is appropriate, the results should be good; however, based on my daughter's conversations, I questioned the doctor's diagnosis. At this point, the mother said that the doctor at Tianjin An Ding Hospital did not say that her daughter had depression, but rather described it as \"depressive emotions,\" and thus suggested that I take my daughter to see a psychologist. Oh, I find this perspective more acceptable. So, who labeled the child with \"moderate depression\"? I asked my daughter how she views depression and the impact it has on her. Both children refused to answer. Later, I expressed my feelings and thoughts transparently, stating that I did not sense my daughter's depressive emotions, but I felt that the mother's anxiety was quite significant! My daughter strongly agreed with my viewpoint. I asked the mother if her anxiety had decreased during the consultation (was I pathologizing my mother)? The mother said, \"If my daughter is better, then I will be better?\" Really? If my daughter's issues are resolved, that would be the predicament this mother least wants to face!", "7. Situational Analysis: Throughout the consultation process, it was only when discussing the couple's marriage that the daughter's attitude began to grow serious, no longer displaying that carefree demeanor. Several times she turned her head to the other side, as if she were crying, unwilling to let me see! This was the embodied response of the daughter that I observed; if one is not sensitive, this detail can easily be overlooked. I believe this consultation had an impact on the daughter."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting upon this unique and intricate case has provided me with profound insights into the multifaceted dynamics at play within this family, as well as the broader implications for therapeutic practice. Initially, the consultation was centered around the daughter's alleged depression and the mother's urgent concern for her well-being. However, as the session unfolded, it became evident that the daughter's issues were symptomatic of deeper, more pervasive familial and relational dynamics. \n\nThe mother, a high-achieving professional, presented with a veneer of composure and determination to seek help for her daughter. Her insistence on finding a solution for her daughter's \"unhappiness\" was palpable, yet it seemed to mask a deeper reluctance to confront her own emotional struggles and the underlying issues in her marriage. The father's role, though less directly engaged during the session, was nonetheless significant. His decision to leave the room with the dog when the daughter expressed indifference was indicative of a pattern of avoidance, possibly mirroring how he navigates emotional conflicts within the family.\n\nThe daughter's self-assigned moniker, \"the killer of psychological counselors,\" initially appeared as a rebellious, perhaps attention-seeking label. However, it soon became clear that it reflected a deeper sense of control and mastery over her situation. Her familiarity with therapeutic \"routines\" suggested a level of sophistication and perhaps a defensive mechanism against vulnerability. Her love for reading psychology books, particularly those focusing on complex and dark themes, hinted at a quest for understanding her own psyche and the world around her. It was as if she was constructing a mental framework to make sense of her internal and external experiences, possibly in the absence of open, emotional communication within her family.\n\nThe turning point in our consultation was the seemingly innocuous topic of her interest in eating fish, which momentarily dissolved her defenses and allowed for genuine engagement. This demonstrated the power of finding common ground and interests that resonate personally with clients, allowing them to feel seen and heard without the pressure of therapeutic agendas. It reminded me of the importance of patience and subtlety in building rapport, especially with adolescents who may feel misunderstood or scrutinized.\n\nThe exploration of the parents' marriage revealed another layer of complexity. The mother's admission of her marriage being a choice made out of necessity rather than desire was revealing. Her description of her husband as someone who is \"good to only me\" suggests a transactional view of their relationship, devoid of emotional intimacy. This dynamic, I suspect, has inadvertently shaped the daughter's perception of relationships and emotional expression. The father's apparent emotional unavailability and the mother's focus on work might have left the daughter feeling isolated, leading her to adopt a self-reliant and emotionally guarded persona.\n\nThe daughter's remark about each family member living in their own room was more than a literal statement; it was metaphorical of the emotional distances between them. This physical and emotional separation likely contributed to her feelings of unhappiness and her self-harming behavior, possibly as a cry for connection and validation that she might not have been able to articulate verbally. It was a poignant moment in the session, highlighting the silent struggles and unspoken tensions that permeated their household.\n\nIn retrospect, the consultation underscored the necessity of addressing the systemic issues within the family. The daughter's presenting symptoms were not isolated phenomena but were intricately linked to the familial context. The mother's initial focus on the daughter's depression diverted attention from the broader relational issues, yet it became clear that these were inextricably intertwined. The session illuminated the importance of shifting the therapeutic lens from individual pathology to relational dynamics and systemic influences.\n\nThe mother's post-consultation reflection via WeChat further validated this shift in perspective. Her acknowledgment of the family's and her own roles in the unfolding dynamics was a critical step toward potential change. It suggested an emerging awareness and willingness to address the deeper issues at play, even if the father remained reluctant to engage in therapy. This highlights the challenge of facilitating change in a family system where not all members are equally committed to the process.\n\nReflecting on the session's impact on the daughter, her reaction during discussions about her parents' marriage was telling. Her somber demeanor and attempts to conceal her emotions indicated a deep-seated vulnerability and perhaps a longing for stability and emotional safety within her family. This was a pivotal moment, suggesting that beneath her facade of indifference and control lay a sensitive and perceptive individual profoundly affected by her parents' relationship.\n\nIn clinical practice, this case reinforced the significance of viewing the client within the context of their familial and relational environment. It also highlighted the need for flexibility and creativity in therapeutic approaches, particularly with adolescents who might resist conventional methods. Engaging clients through their interests and allowing space for them to express themselves on their terms can foster trust and facilitate deeper exploration.\n\nThis case also prompted me to reflect on the role of parental anxiety and its impact on children. The mother's anxiety, though centered on her daughter's well-being, inadvertently contributed to the cycle of distress within the family. By addressing her anxiety and helping her recognize its broader implications, there is potential for transformative change that could benefit the entire family.\n\nUltimately, this consultation was a reminder of the complexity and interconnectedness of human experiences. It emphasized the importance of holistic, systemic approaches in therapy, where the focus is not solely on alleviating symptoms but on fostering healthier relationships and communication patterns. The journey toward healing and change is often non-linear and requires patience, empathy, and a willingness to navigate the fog of uncertainty.", "causes": "Daughter's depressive tendencies due to family tension and mother's anxiety.", "symptoms": "Social avoidance, irritability, self-harming tendencies.", "treatment_process": "Empathy and understanding: Establishing a trusting relationship;\n Family Dialogue Therapy (FDT): The mother and daughter express their feelings and thoughts separately, and the counselor helps the client to clarify the connection between the mother's anxiety, the conflict in the parents' marriage, and the discord in their marital relationship and the daughter's current emotional problems.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Parental conflict, lack of emotional communication among family members, which leads the daughter to gain attention and a sense of control through behaviors such as anorexia and self-harm.", "treatment_effect": "Through Family Dialogue Therapy, we help the client clarify that the strained family relationship is the cause of the daughter's emotional problems, and that the emotional detachment of the family members has led the daughter to adopt a reverse emotional defense mechanism, and that the current changes need to start with the mother's anxiety, thus breaking the cycle of suffering within the family."}

He feels particularly distressed, often feels stuffy and panicked, and finds life very exhausting.  \n\nDetailed Record of the First Consultation:  \nClient: Doctor, is everything I say to you confidential?  \nConsultant: Yes, every word you say in this consultation room cannot be disclosed by me; this is a professional confidentiality principle. If you find out I leaked your information, you can take legal action against me.  \nClient: I checked online before and know it will be kept confidential; I just wanted to confirm.  \nConsultant: It seems you feel quite insecure. Has anything happened recently that made you uncomfortable?  \nClient: I always feel deceived. Honest people like me are easily bullied, and I can't get what I want. I also hesitate to refuse others, which makes me very uncomfortable. I often feel stuffy and panicked, and life is very exhausting.  \nConsultant: The feeling of being deceived is indeed painful. Can you share more about what specifically happened?  \nClient: At work, I am a small civil servant in the town government. I have a lot of tasks, but I can complete them. However, other colleagues, especially older ones, often ask me to help them with their work. They have been around for a long time, and at first, I thought I could help them, but over time, they began to take it for granted. They often ask me to do this and that without even saying thank you. I feel very resentful; it’s a true reflection of \"the kind are bullied, and the good horses are ridden.\"  \nConsultant: You have taken on many tasks that shouldn't have been yours, and you feel uncomfortable about it, right?  \nClient: Yes, if it were just about doing more work, it would be fine, but their attitude makes me very uncomfortable; they act as if it's a given. When the leader assigns tasks, they all push them onto me. They treat me like a fool. I have my own life and am not working for them. I really dislike them now. I feel oppressed at work but don’t know how to talk to my leader about it. I'm distressed and don’t want to be used as a fool anymore.  \nConsultant: You have helped your colleagues in the past, but it has resulted in them increasingly pushing their work onto you without gratitude. Their attitude toward handling issues makes you feel disrespected, so you no longer want to help them, but you don’t know how to communicate with your leader and refuse their requests.  \nClient: Yes, I’m very afraid to see the leader; I often become incoherent in front of them. What I want to say often turns into something else. They are articulate, and the leader thinks they are very capable.  \nConsultant: It seems that you are not afraid of hard work but are very concerned about the leader’s recognition and your colleagues’ attitudes toward you.  \nClient: Yes, I don’t know why, but I don’t mind working hard; however, the suppression and exclusion from colleagues, along with the leader’s indifference, really upset me.  \nConsultant: I think you long for recognition from others, especially affirmation from the leader.  \nClient: Yes, I care a lot about others' evaluations of me. No one praised me when I was young, and I particularly want to perform well at work to gain recognition from colleagues and leaders. I didn’t expect to end up in this situation, and I feel very bad, not knowing how to handle it.  \nConsultant: Perhaps your parents seldom affirmed you when you were young. Would you like to talk about your family?  \nClient: It feels like my family was not very happy when I was young. My parents moved from the countryside to the city to work, renting a room where we all squeezed together. I was in the same class as the landlord's child and was very afraid that classmates would find out I lived in someone else's house. I often avoided the landlord's child while walking, fearing that he would walk with me and others would look down on me. My family was financially tight, and I didn’t have many toys. After I asked, my father bought me a game console, and I was very happy playing with it. However, because I kept playing games and neglected eating and doing homework, my mother was very angry and broke the game console. At that time, I hated my mother very much for taking away my only joy. My two sisters did well in school, especially my second sister. My father often asked her to help me with my homework, but she was impatient and would criticize me. My parents often compared me with my sister, which made me very angry and dislike her. During the college entrance examination, I didn’t get into a bachelor's degree program and had to repeat a year before getting into a private university, but it was quite expensive.  \n\nRecord of the Second Psychological Consultation:  \nClient's Complaint: I often ask my family for money because I need to spend money on dating. My parents pressure me to get married and introduce me to potential partners, and I also go see them. Therefore, during the dating process, I need to ask my parents to reimburse me for expenses like meals, movies, and gifts. Sometimes I ask my parents for around 5000 yuan in a month. On one hand, they blame me, and on the other hand, they hope I can settle down and start a family. After several blind dates, I finally found a girlfriend that we both think is nice and we are getting to know each other. My father said a friend introduced him to a girl with good conditions; she is an only child and her family has several houses, so he asked me to pursue that girl. I followed my father's wishes and pursued her. After several meetings, both families were quite satisfied. Once, while traveling together and encouraged by our families, I was ready to propose, but unexpectedly, the girl refused, saying the feelings weren’t there. After that, she felt it wasn’t suitable and declined further contact. I was devastated, feeling like I had put in a lot of effort for nothing. I hate my father; it's all his fault for making me end up like this. I lost control of my emotions and had a big fight with my family, saying I wouldn’t get married anymore.  \n\nRecord of the Third Psychological Consultation:  \nClient's Complaint: During middle school, I was seduced into a sexual encounter by a male doctor from a clinic near my home and experienced sexual pleasure. I think I am gay. In college, I had a sexual encounter with a man through a gay website, but later he extorted me using my semen, and I had to ask my father to help me deal with this difficult situation, which severely harmed my emotions. After seeking help from a school counselor, I improved a bit. During college, I had difficulty studying and was not focused on my studies, and I even took a break for a period. In the end, I completed my studies through my father's financial support, giving gifts to teachers and cheating.  \n\nRecord of the Fourth Psychological Consultation:  \nClient's Complaint: The office director has been transferred, and I was selected by my leader to temporarily take over as office director, but I don't hold a deputy position. I rarely go home from the town and work over ten hours a day, almost always working overtime. I often pay for meals to take my colleagues out. This year, two male college students joined the office, and I particularly like one of them, so I often cover for him when he is late, takes leave, or makes mistakes. However, he has a girlfriend, and I know he is not gay, but I still silently invest my feelings in him. Because of my indulgence, people in the office gradually lost respect for me and often contradicted me, even complaining about work arrangements and shirking tasks. The male colleague I have feelings for organizes barbecues with other colleagues but doesn’t invite me, making me feel excluded. The conflicts in the office have intensified, and I feel unfit to be a leader.  \n\nRecord of the Fifth Psychological Consultation:  \nClient's Complaint: Recently, I've been feeling very irritable, as if there is a stone pressing down on my heart. When I go to roadside stalls to buy fruit, the aunties always pick out one or two bad ones. Once I bought a large watermelon, but when I got home and cut it open, it was red and white inside, indicating it wasn’t ripe. The aunt said all her watermelons are sweet. The more I thought about it, the angrier I became, so I ran out holding the watermelon to exchange it with the stall owner, but she refused because it had already been cut. In anger, I threw the watermelon on the ground. I also have similar experiences with taxi drivers; they often raise the price because my home is in a remote area. I feel like everyone I encounter is bullying me, so I often argue with taxi drivers. Once, I went to the district government office to handle something, and the taxi driver wanted to charge me extra, which I refused. After I finished my business, he was still waiting outside for payment. Lately, nothing seems to go well. I don’t dare to lose my temper at work, so I vent my frustrations on those at the lower end of society, but I find them very fierce and uncivilized, which makes me even more angry.  \n\nRecord of the Sixth Psychological Consultation:  \nClient's Complaint: Recently, when I returned home for the weekend, my mom invited her friends over to play mahjong, making me feel quite uncomfortable moving in and out. I felt a bit irritated, and my mom was very angry, thinking I didn’t consider her feelings. She then told my dad and sisters, and both my dad and sister called me to ask me to respect and understand my mom. In fact, I really dislike my mom; she is just an ignorant rural woman who keeps gossiping and always tells me to eat things she thinks are nutritious, buying cheap and unappetizing fruits, which is very annoying. After this conflict, not long after, she told me she would go to my elder sister's house in Fuzhou to help take care of the kids, partly to avoid conflict with me. I feel like I really look down on my mom and often yell at her, so I think she is avoiding me to prevent conflict between us. My sisters also fear that my mom will be unhappy, so they take her to Fuzhou.  \n\nRecord of the Seventh Psychological Consultation:  \nClient's Complaint: Recently, I often buy fruits and have gotten to know a cleaner-looking young man at the fruit shop, occasionally taking him out to eat. Over time, I found that I really like him, but I am afraid to tell him I am gay, fearing he might not accept me and also afraid of being threatened like back in college. I feel that gay people are very lonely and cannot find true love. Occasionally, I run to Fuzhou, where there is a gay club with some gay people, but when I’m with them, it’s all about sex and not feelings. Some of the gay people there are even married with wives and kids; they are just pretending to be gay for fun. I feel that my emotional needs are not being met. Now that my family knows I am gay, they no longer urge me to get married, but I still feel that life is meaningless. Sometimes I think about quitting my job, selling my house, and finding a place with a gay community to indulge for a while before ending my life. At least I would have some happy moments. Of course, this is just a thought; the reality is still quite binding, but I am not that extreme yet. Who knows, maybe one day it could happen.  \n\nRecord of the Eighth Psychological Consultation:  \nClient's Complaint: My sister introduced me to a female colleague from her unit, who comes from a family with financial difficulties but is very warm-hearted. I found that I don't reject interacting with the opposite sex; dating someone of the opposite sex can also be a happy thing, feeling cared for and having someone to call and share my thoughts with. Sometimes I think about marriage, but I fear that if others find out I am gay after marriage, they might divorce me. I have also had sexual relations with women. I really like my sister's child; my nephew is very cute, and having children to continue the family line is something my parents hope for and expect. Sometimes I think about just casually marrying a woman, but I also feel that I don’t love her much. The wedding gifts are so expensive, and if we divorce, it would be very unwise.  \n\nRecord of the Ninth Psychological Consultation:  \nClient's Complaint: Recently, I was temporarily transferred to the city government to help out. I feel that I am not very happy staying in the town and really want to get help from relatives to transfer to work in the city or district. However, my family is not very supportive financially. During my time as office director, I had to build good relationships with the town mayor and secretary, so I often asked my family for money to give gifts. In order to win over my subordinates, I also asked my family for money to treat them to meals. So this time, my family won’t give me money anymore; they think I am just wasting money and looking for ways to ask them for money. In fact, I really want to return to the city; I don’t want to stay in the town anymore. The interpersonal relationships in the office are quite tense now, and I am sensitive and suspicious, living a very hard life. I have no ability to transfer jobs, and my family is not helping me, which is very frustrating."], "experience_and_reflection": "The experience and reflections on the case of this gay client with anxiety, depression, and adjustment disorder require a nuanced exploration of various contributing factors. As a clinician, it is essential to approach the topic of sexual orientation with sensitivity, understanding, and an awareness of the complex interplay of genetics, environment, and personal history.\n\nInitially, it is critical to acknowledge the multi-faceted nature of homosexuality. Genetic factors indeed play a significant role, as studies have suggested a strong hereditary component. However, it is equally important to recognize that human sexuality exists on a spectrum, and the rigid dichotomy of heterosexual versus homosexual does not fully capture the diversity of human sexual experiences. Moreover, while genetic predispositions may exist, they interact with a multitude of environmental and psychological factors that shape one's sexual orientation and identity.\n\nThe client's experiences with familial relationships offer a lens through which to understand some of the emotional and psychological struggles they face. The client's narrative reveals a lack of affirmation and emotional support during childhood, particularly from paternal figures. This absence of a nurturing male role model may contribute to the client's seeking validation and acceptance from male peers and superiors, a pattern that persists into adulthood. Furthermore, the strained relationship with the mother, coupled with her apparent lack of understanding and empathy, could exacerbate feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt. These familial dynamics, characterized by criticism and comparison, likely contributed to the client's low self-esteem and internalized sense of worthlessness.\n\nThe client's history of childhood trauma, specifically the encounter with the male doctor, adds another layer of complexity. Such experiences can have profound effects on an individual's psychological development and perception of relationships. The trauma may lead to confusion about boundaries and consent, further complicating the client's understanding of their sexuality. Moreover, the subsequent extortion incident during college would have reinforced feelings of vulnerability and mistrust, potentially leading to anxiety around forming new relationships and a fear of exploitation or betrayal.\n\nIt is also essential to consider the societal and cultural pressures that influence the client's mental health. Growing up in an environment where homosexuality is stigmatized can create a profound sense of isolation and fear. The client's experience of loneliness and the perception that genuine emotional connections are unattainable reflect the internalized homophobia that many LGBTQ+ individuals grapple with. This internal conflict can manifest as depression and anxiety, as the individual struggles to reconcile their identity with societal expectations.\n\nIn exploring the client's professional life, we see a pattern of overcompensation and people-pleasing behaviors. The client expresses a desire for recognition and affirmation from colleagues and superiors, often at the expense of their well-being. This need for external validation is likely rooted in the lack of affirmation received during childhood and the ongoing struggle for self-acceptance. The client's difficulty in asserting boundaries and the tendency to take on additional responsibilities without receiving gratitude further indicate an ingrained belief that their worth is tied to their ability to serve others.\n\nThe client's interactions with family also reveal a tension between personal desires and familial expectations. The pressure to marry and conform to heteronormative standards, despite a preference for same-sex relationships, highlights the conflict between self-identity and external pressures. The client's contemplation of a heterosexual marriage as a means to fulfill familial expectations underscores the internalized conflict and fear of societal rejection.\n\nIn addressing the client's mental health concerns, it is vital to adopt an integrative therapeutic approach that considers these various factors. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can be instrumental in challenging the client's negative self-perceptions and developing healthier coping mechanisms. Additionally, exploring the client's past traumas and their impact on current relationships through trauma-informed therapy could facilitate healing and promote a sense of empowerment.\n\nEmpathy and validation are crucial components of the therapeutic process, helping the client to feel seen and understood in their struggles. Encouraging the client to explore and embrace their sexual identity without fear of judgment or rejection can foster self-acceptance and resilience. It is also important to support the client in building a supportive network, whether through LGBTQ+ community resources or by strengthening healthy relationships with family and friends.\n\nThe client's contemplation of extreme measures, such as quitting their job and retreating into a gay community, speaks to a profound sense of despair and hopelessness. Addressing these thoughts in therapy requires a compassionate and non-judgmental approach, offering the client a safe space to express their fears and explore alternative pathways to fulfillment and happiness.\n\nIn summary, the client's case underscores the importance of a holistic and empathetic approach to therapy, considering the interplay of genetic, familial, societal, and personal factors in shaping an individual's mental health and identity. By fostering a therapeutic environment of acceptance and understanding, clinicians can support clients in navigating their unique journeys toward self-discovery and emotional well-being.", "causes": "Anxiety, depressive tendencies, and adjustment disorders resulting from unsupportive family-of-origin environments, homosexuality at odds with the dominant culture, and stressful workplace relationships.", "symptoms": "Anxiety, insecurity, often feeling cheated and bullied, afraid to refuse coworkers' requests.", "treatment_process": "Empathy and Understanding: Establishing a trusting relationship and allowing visitors to explore their emotions in a safe environment;\n Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: Helping clients challenge negative self-perceptions (that their value is tied to their ability to serve others) and develop healthier coping mechanisms (learning to say no).\n Trauma-informed therapy: exploring the client's past traumas and their impact on current relationships (an extortion incident during college can reinforce feelings of vulnerability and mistrust, and may lead to anxiety about forming new relationships and fear of exploitation or betrayal) can promote healing and enhance the client's sense of empowerment.", "characteristics_of_illness": "An unsupportive upbringing in which the client over-pleases others to validate his or her self-worth, and a homosexual identity and experience that leads to profound feelings of isolation and fear.", "treatment_effect": "Through empathy and acceptance techniques, the counselor helps the client to feel seen and understood in her struggles.

So I quickly got up, brushed my teeth, washed my face, and hurriedly took a taxi to the counseling office.

She experiences tension with colleagues at work, and in general, has difficulty interacting with everyone.

Additionally, I advised her mother to visit a psychiatric specialty hospital for medication treatment to control the progression of the depression, while also pursuing psychological counseling.", "At that time, Liu had no money to pay the consultation fee, and her parents didn't have any money either (they are retired). A year ago, Liu had an accident where she hit an elderly woman with her bicycle, who later died, and the court ordered her to pay 150,000 yuan in compensation, which was covered by her parents. I told them that it was okay not to have money right now; saving the person was the priority, and they could pay me later when they had the money.", "In the subsequent counseling sessions, I closely monitored the effects of the medication. During the period when the medication had not yet taken effect, I advised her to be patient (as the effects of antidepressants typically take time to manifest, generally becoming noticeable after about two weeks). Once the severe depressive symptoms subsided, I informed her that the medication should not be discontinued; she needed to maintain treatment for three to six months to prevent relapse (as depression is very prone to relapse, and the second relapse is often harder to treat than the first).

Additionally, there was a red envelope containing 1000 yuan. I accepted her gifts and expressed my gratitude! However, I did not accept the 1000 yuan envelope (I had already collected the usual consulting fees)."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on this case has been an enlightening journey into the complexities of severe depression and the profound impact of interpersonal relationships on mental health. The initial symptoms that presented—such as her intense emotional distress, suicide attempt, and the physical manifestations of her depression—were indeed alarming. However, through the process of psychotherapy, it became increasingly apparent that these symptoms were merely the surface manifestations of deeper, unresolved issues rooted in her interpersonal dynamics and self-perception.\n\nAt the outset, Liu was engulfed in a profound sense of hopelessness and disconnection from those around her. Her hearing impairment from a young age had set a precedent for communication challenges, significantly influencing her self-esteem and capacity to form healthy relationships. This impairment, combined with the emotional distress stemming from strained familial and marital relationships, created a fertile ground for severe depression. The streptomycin reaction, a seemingly isolated medical incident, had profound ripple effects on her psychosocial development, demonstrating how early physiological challenges can evolve into complex psychological and relational issues.\n\nThe therapeutic journey began with an urgent intervention following her suicide attempt. This was a critical moment that required immediate action and compassionate support. The initial focus was on stabilizing her condition, both through psychological counseling and the necessary medical intervention. Recognizing the high risk she posed to herself, I prioritized creating a safe environment by involving her family and advocating for psychiatric evaluation and medication management. This dual approach highlighted the importance of integrated care in managing severe depression—a realization that has been reinforced through this case.\n\nLiu's narrative, rich with personal insights and emotional expressions, provided a window into her struggles with communication and connection. Her statements about her marriage, her relationship with her siblings, and her workplace interactions all underscored a pervasive theme of interpersonal dissonance. Her husband’s inability to understand her needs and her own communication style that often exacerbated conflicts revealed how critical the role of effective communication is in maintaining relational harmony. These dynamics were further complicated by her use of maladaptive coping mechanisms, such as her reliance on sexual behaviors to modulate emotional states, which pointed to a need for healthier emotional regulation strategies.\n\nThrough cognitive therapy, the focus shifted to unpacking these layers of interpersonal discord and reshaping her interaction patterns. This involved teaching Liu how to recognize and appreciate the strengths in others—a technique symbolized by the \"thumb method\"—and learning to articulate her needs and feelings in ways that foster connection rather than conflict. This method was pivotal in transforming her relationship with her husband, where affirming his positive traits led to unexpected improvements in their domestic interactions. Similarly, adopting strategies such as \"the highest good is like water\" facilitated more harmonious relationships with her in-laws, showing that empathy and positive reinforcement can be powerful tools in overcoming familial tensions.\n\nIn the workplace, Liu applied newfound skills to foster camaraderie with colleagues, illustrating how small acts of kindness and consideration can build bridges in seemingly impenetrable environments. Her approach to cleaning the office and attending to her colleagues' needs transformed her workplace relationships and, importantly, her own self-perception. This evolution not only alleviated her feelings of isolation but also instilled a sense of belonging and purpose, which are vital counterweights to depression.\n\nLiu's story is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the transformative power of psychotherapy. Her journey from despair to empowerment was marked by a gradual shift from focusing on symptoms to addressing underlying relational issues. This case has reinforced the clinical insight that depression often thrives in isolation and discord, and by fostering connection, understanding, and empathy, we can begin to dismantle its grip.\n\nThe integration of various therapeutic modalities—cognitive therapy, Morita therapy, rational emotive therapy, and intention dialogue—played a crucial role in this transformation. Each approach contributed uniquely to Liu's healing process, offering different perspectives and techniques that addressed her specific needs. Cognitive therapy's emphasis on restructuring thought patterns was foundational, while Morita therapy's focus on accepting emotions and finding purpose provided Liu with a framework to navigate her inner experiences. Rational emotive therapy helped challenge and change the irrational beliefs that fueled her interpersonal conflicts, and intention dialogue facilitated deeper self-reflection and improved communication skills.\n\nAs Liu's depressive symptoms began to subside, a new challenge emerged: the potential for manic states, indicative of bipolar tendencies. This aspect of her condition required careful monitoring and adjustment of her treatment plan, underscoring the importance of vigilance and adaptability in clinical practice. The necessity to balance medication with psychotherapy highlights the complex interplay between biological and psychological factors in managing mood disorders.\n\nReflecting on Liu's journey, I am reminded of the importance of seeing beyond the immediate presentation of symptoms to understand the broader context of a patient's life. Her case underscores the principle that depression is often a symptom of deeper, unresolved relational issues, and that by addressing these, we can achieve significant therapeutic outcomes. The success of her treatment illustrates the efficacy of a holistic approach that integrates emotional, relational, and cognitive dimensions of healing.\n\nLiu's transformation from a woman overwhelmed by depression to one who finds joy and meaning in social interactions is a powerful narrative of recovery. Her story serves as a beacon of hope for others grappling with similar challenges and reaffirms my belief in the potential for psychotherapy to effect profound change. Her growth in interpersonal skills and self-awareness not only alleviated her depressive symptoms but also equipped her with tools to navigate life's complexities with confidence and resilience.\n\nIn conclusion, this case has deepened my understanding of the intricate relationship between interpersonal dynamics and mental health. It has reinforced the value of a patient-centered approach that considers the unique experiences and challenges each individual faces. Liu's recovery journey exemplifies how addressing primary relational issues can lead to the resolution of secondary depressive symptoms, offering valuable insights for future clinical practice. As I continue to reflect on her story, I am inspired by her courage and the transformative power of psychotherapy in unlocking the potential for healing and growth.", "causes": "Family, marital, and workplace relationship conflicts due to hearing impairment and communication difficulties, leading to depression.", "symptoms": "Severe depression, suicidal behavior.", "treatment_process": "Cognitive therapy: Emphasizes the reorganization of thinking patterns, and sees the essence of interpersonal conflicts through the symptoms of depression;\n Morita therapy: helps visitors accept emotions and focus on behaviors, go with the flow, do what is necessary, and reduce anxiety;\n Rational Emotive Therapy: helps visitors challenge and change irrational beliefs that fuel interpersonal conflict;\n Intentional Dialogue: facilitates deeper self-reflection and improves communication skills.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Miscommunication due to childhood hearing loss, leading to chronic interpersonal tension and conflict, and depression.", "treatment_effect": "Through the integrated use of cognitive therapy and Morita therapy, the counselor helped the client to get out of the severe depression and improve her interpersonal relationships by changing her interpersonal strategies.

My mom is a generous person, but after observing my sister's husband over the years, I feel he is a bit selfish and has a short temper.

Deep down, I am actually very vulnerable and want to become stronger."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting upon my extensive journey within the realm of psychology, I find myself deeply entrenched in the profound intricacies of human behavior and the diverse challenges faced by individuals in their interpersonal relationships. Over the years, my commitment to understanding and alleviating psychological distress has driven me to develop the \"Psychology of Form and Meaning and Comprehensive Therapy of Kindness and Authority,\" an academic framework that addresses the psychological needs of contemporary society. Through this framework, I aim to foster emotional and psychological growth in marriage, family, and interpersonal relationships, ensuring they evolve in a healthy and orderly manner.\n\nIn examining the case titled \"Is it because I am not magnanimous, or is it that he doesn't know how to be a person?\" I am reminded of the complexities inherent in family dynamics, particularly when individuals struggle with differing perceptions and expectations within familial roles. This case illuminates the tension between the helper and her brother-in-law, showcasing the deep-seated frustrations and the resultant conflict that stems from unmet familial expectations and perceived injustices.\n\nThe helper's struggle with accepting her brother-in-law's behavior reveals an underlying concern for her sister's well-being and the broader family harmony. Her anger and resentment are palpable, fueled by the belief that her family has extended kindness and support to her brother-in-law, yet he has not reciprocated with gratitude or respectful behavior. This scenario is a testament to the challenges of navigating relationships where one feels their efforts are undervalued or unappreciated, leading to a sense of moral injustice and emotional turmoil.\n\nAs a clinician, it is crucial to delve into the psychological underpinnings of such familial conflicts. The helper's narrative reflects a protective instinct towards her sister, stemming from their shared history and the perceived vulnerability of her sister due to a lack of independence and social experience. The helper's anger is compounded by her sister's passive demeanor, which she interprets as a failure to stand up for herself. This dynamic points to the helper's internal conflict between her desire to protect her sister and the recognition that her intervention might not yield the desired change.\n\nIn exploring the psychological analysis of this case, it is essential to consider the implications of cohabitation within a multi-generational household. Living together can amplify misunderstandings and tensions, as personal boundaries become blurred and individual privacy is compromised. The helper's feelings of being calculative and unable to genuinely accept her brother-in-law suggest a struggle with reconciling her emotions and finding peace within the familial setup. This highlights the importance of establishing separate living arrangements to reduce friction and allow each family unit to develop independently.\n\nMoreover, the case underscores the role of cultural and familial norms in shaping expectations and behaviors. The helper's reflections on her parents' attitudes and their educational methods reveal a backdrop of mixed messages regarding authority, kindness, and punishment. These formative experiences likely influence the helper's current perceptions and interactions with her brother-in-law, as she grapples with the lessons learned from her upbringing and their application in adult relationships.\n\nThe helper's interactions with her nephew further illustrate the complexity of familial roles and the emotional investment in the younger generation. Her concern over the nephew's welfare, particularly in the face of perceived harsh discipline from the brother-in-law, showcases the protective instincts that often arise within family dynamics. The helper's frustration at witnessing her nephew being hit and her subsequent emotional response reflect the innate desire to safeguard those she loves from harm, even when her role in the family does not formally encompass parental responsibilities.\n\nFrom a clinical perspective, the helper's reflections raise important considerations regarding the boundaries of intervention in family matters. While her intentions are rooted in love and concern, the helper's actions can inadvertently exacerbate conflicts, placing her at odds with other family members. This case serves as a poignant reminder of the need to balance protective instincts with respect for autonomy and the natural consequences of familial interactions.\n\nIn offering guidance, the principle of kindness and authority becomes pivotal. Encouraging the helper to cultivate empathy and understanding towards her brother-in-law, despite their differences, is essential in fostering a more harmonious family environment. While the helper may not feel compelled to be overtly kind, adopting a stance of neutrality and disengagement from direct confrontation can prevent further escalation of tensions.\n\nAdditionally, the helper's self-reflection on her emotional vulnerabilities and desire for personal growth presents an opportunity for therapeutic intervention. By addressing her feelings of inadequacy and her aspiration to become stronger, the helper can be guided towards developing resilience and emotional regulation. This self-improvement journey not only benefits her personal well-being but also enhances her ability to navigate complex familial relationships with greater equanimity.\n\nThrough this case, I am reminded of the multifaceted nature of psychological practice and the enduring impact of familial relationships on individual mental health. As a clinician, my role extends beyond providing immediate solutions; it encompasses nurturing long-term growth and understanding within the familial context. By integrating the principles of kindness and authority, we can support individuals in cultivating healthier relationships, ultimately contributing to a more balanced and harmonious family life.\n\nReflecting on my experiences and the insights gained from this case, I am inspired to continue advancing the academic system of \"Psychology of Form and Meaning and Comprehensive Therapy of Kindness and Authority.\" My hope is to empower individuals to navigate their emotional landscapes with wisdom and empathy, fostering resilience and adaptability in the face of life's challenges. Through dedicated exploration and application of psychological principles, I strive to nurture a society where emotional and psychological well-being flourishes, enabling individuals to thrive within their interpersonal relationships.", "causes": "Dissatisfaction with her brother-in-law caused tension in the family.", "symptoms": "Anger at her brother-in-law's poor attitude toward her family, and a sense of inadequacy that she is not strong enough to protect her family.", "treatment_process": "Family Systemic Therapy: Helping the client to clarify the boundaries of intervention in family affairs, encouraging the client to develop empathy and understanding for her brother-in-law, and preventing further escalation of the family conflict by adopting a neutral and non-confrontational stance;\n Cognitive-behavioral therapy: to help the client realize that her anger and resentment towards her brother-in-law is partly due to her dissatisfaction with her own abilities, and that the process of self-improvement is not only beneficial to her personal well-being, but also enables her to deal with the complexity of her family relationships in a more peaceful manner.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Three generations living in the same family, the visitor's protectiveness towards her family and her anger and resentment towards her brother-in-law.", "treatment_effect": "Through family therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy, the visitor was able to clarify the boundaries of family intervention, improve her self-competence, and deal with complex family relationships with a more peaceful mind."}
{"id": 116, "case_description": ["Visitor, female, 35 years old, bachelor's degree, homemaker. Married for 10 years, with a 9-year-old boy. Main symptoms of the visitor: chest tightness and shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, and hand tremors. The visitor describes her symptoms as follows: \"When I'm not feeling well, I feel sensitive, suspicious, timid, chest tightness, nervousness, palpitations, prone to fatigue, lack of appetite, choking after eating, tightness in my head, headaches, lack of motivation to work, and sometimes when I'm anxious, my mind feels foggy.\" Additionally, the visitor has experienced postpartum depression and has taken anti-anxiety medication. Currently, blood test results from the hospital show low potassium levels. She was hospitalized a month ago due to a panic attack."], "consultation_process": ["2. Consultation Process: There was a 12-day gap between this consultation and the last one. During these 12 days, the client experienced anxiety twice. The first time was when the therapist asked if she had come for the consultation on the planned date; the client felt anxious because there were only two consultation opportunities left, and she was financially strained, wanting to use the last two sessions when she felt the worst. The second episode of anxiety occurred yesterday morning when her brother called to ask her about purchasing renovation materials for his house. Since her brother lacked experience, the client felt that the tiles he bought were not economical. She panicked, leading to symptoms like a racing heart, dizziness, and elevated blood pressure. The client suspected that her potassium levels might be low, but after going to the hospital for a check-up, her potassium levels were found to be normal. The next morning, she went to the hospital for a blood test again, and the results were not concerning, so the doctor prescribed some medication. Our initial consultation goal was to address how to cope with anxiety. From the beginning, we focused on how to solve problems! The client started describing her symptoms when anxious: feeling timid and weak, having a rapid heartbeat, high blood pressure, and worrying about her child not being picked up and dropped off for school. She also expressed concerns about her health, fearing she was low on potassium, having a poor appetite, and experiencing nervous hiccups and frequent tension headaches. Later, the client concluded that she was essentially scaring herself. Reflecting on the last consultation, the client was very worried about living alone at home with her child. I was curious about how she managed during such a long period. The client mentioned that she now has a group of friends and often goes to the market with them. Additionally, recently her husband has been staying at home more often due to work reasons, so she has not felt anxious due to loneliness. Furthermore, the client summarized some successful experiences in her interactions with others, such as spending more time with positive people, and being generous and not keeping score when with her sisters-in-law, which helped her maintain good relationships with them. Later, I discussed the support she received from people around her during this time. For example, her older sister is capable and opinionated, making her feel comfortable when with her. The client has had less interaction with her family sister, saying that her sister is somewhat selfish and she is reluctant to engage with her. However, her older sister, who studies medicine and practices Buddhism, sent her CDs and books like the \"Great Compassion Mantra\" and the \"Diamond Sutra\" after learning about her situation, encouraging her to listen to, recite, and copy the texts in her spare time. Initially, the client practiced for two days but later felt it was not very helpful and gave up. The client stated that she is a person who holds grudges yet is also grateful (this statement is quite important!). She is very willing to help others, but when facing her own difficulties, she fears being a burden to others and is reluctant to ask for help, which she considers a weakness in her character!", "3. The effect of this consultation: I believe the biggest effect of this consultation is that the visitor has seen herself and recognized how her thinking and behavior patterns limit her: although she is willing to help others and will give her utmost when someone needs her, she struggles with her own difficulties, fears bothering others, and is not accustomed to asking for help or expressing her inner needs. This may be the reason why the visitor often feels lonely and helpless!", "IV. Case Analysis: The visitor's tension and anxiety stem from a frequent sense of loneliness and helplessness, which originates from a lack of security. This may be related to her inability to see the support system around her, and she is also unaware of her character weaknesses, such as her reluctance to trouble others and her embarrassment in asking for help when facing difficulties.", "V. Reflection on the Success or Failure of Consultation Goals: Our initial goal at the beginning of the consultation was to help the client deal with their anxiety. However, halfway through the consultation, the client expressed that discussing these issues made her uncomfortable and she wanted to talk about how to be more optimistic. This suggestion from the client was quite postmodern and impressive. We then began to discuss who she felt happy and joyful with. Through our discussion, we discovered that being with people who were helpful to her brought her happiness. Who had helped her in the past? When facing difficulties, how could she receive help from others? This exploration allowed the client to broaden her perspective and recognize the increasing number of resources available around her. I believe the initial consultation goal is not important; what matters is what kind of companionship the client needs. This reminds me of He Lin's analogy of consultation as a walk taken together by the counselor and the client, or the theory of taking a helicopter ride to see the scenery below together.", "Reflection on the consultation process:", "At the beginning of the consultation, although I was also looking for the client's strengths, we were still discussing how the client copes with anxiety. We were focused on the problems and finding solutions, which made the client feel uncomfortable and made it difficult to move forward. Later, the client proposed their own idea - to talk about how to be more optimistic. This shifted the direction of our consultation and allowed the client to see themselves differently, recognizing the limitations of their thinking and behavioral patterns.", "In this consultation, we discussed the visitor's relationships with friends and family, and I suddenly realized that we are looking for resources around the visitor. Would it alleviate the visitor's frequent feelings of loneliness and helplessness if they could see these effective and accessible resources around them?", "Summary of Experience: In psychological counseling, our role as counselors is to expand the range of choices and understanding, while collaboratively constructing new possibilities for action with the clients. The approach is to focus on a specific aspect of each person's life and relationships, helping them define a new, more empowering life story. We should not be fixated on achieving specific counseling goals and outcomes; our role as counselors is to stimulate therapeutic dialogue, allowing clients' goals and thoughts to be heard, validated, and respected at any time, guiding the conversation to help clients move along their chosen path. In this process, anxious clients can let go of their worries and anxieties, and, with the counselor's support, better grow themselves!", "7.

Who is the second person you want to turn to? Why? What would you say when you ask for their help? Who is the third person you want to turn to? Why? What would you say when you ask for their help? Continue this way and see how many people you can identify that you can turn to for help!"], "experience_and_reflection": "Experience Summary: In psychological counseling, our work as counselors is not merely about addressing symptoms or resolving specific issues; rather, it is about expanding the range of choices and understanding available to clients. This is particularly true in cases of anxiety disorder, where clients often feel trapped in a cycle of fear and helplessness. By collaboratively constructing new possibilities for action with clients, we can help them redefine their life narratives in ways that are empowering and liberating.\n\nAnxiety is a multifaceted condition that affects individuals on various levels—physiological, psychological, and social. In this particular case, the client's anxiety was intertwined with feelings of loneliness and helplessness, stemming from her reluctance to ask for help and her discomfort in expressing her needs. This reluctance can often be traced back to deep-seated beliefs or past experiences, which the client may not be fully aware of. As counselors, it is our responsibility to gently guide the exploration of these underlying factors, helping the client uncover and understand them.\n\nOne core insight from this case is the importance of recognizing and utilizing the support systems available to the client. Often, individuals with anxiety feel isolated and believe they have to face their challenges alone. This belief can exacerbate their symptoms, leading to increased feelings of helplessness. Through narrative therapy, we can help clients reframe their stories, emphasizing the presence of supportive relationships and resources around them. In this case, the client was able to identify positive interactions with friends and family members, which provided her with a sense of comfort and security.\n\nThe consultation process revealed that the client's anxiety was triggered by specific stressors, such as financial strain and family obligations. These triggers are common in anxiety disorders and often require targeted interventions. By focusing on problem-solving strategies and emotional regulation techniques, clients can learn to manage their responses to stressors more effectively. However, it is crucial that this process is client-centered and collaborative, allowing the client to feel empowered and in control of their journey.\n\nThe shift in the consultation from focusing on anxiety symptoms to exploring optimism and positive relationships was a pivotal moment. It highlighted the client's resilience and capacity for self-reflection, demonstrating that change is possible when clients feel heard and supported. As counselors, we must be flexible and open to adjusting our approach based on the client's needs and preferences. This flexibility is not only essential for building trust but also for facilitating meaningful therapeutic change.\n\nIn narrative therapy, the concept of \"externalizing the problem\" can be particularly beneficial for clients with anxiety. By helping them view their anxiety as separate from their identity, they can begin to see themselves as capable of overcoming it. This process involves exploring the client's values, strengths, and past successes, which can be harnessed to combat the anxiety. Encouraging clients to engage with activities that promote their well-being, such as socializing with positive individuals or practicing mindfulness, can also aid in this process.\n\nReflecting on this case, it becomes evident that the client's reluctance to seek help was a significant barrier to her progress. This reluctance is not uncommon in anxiety disorders, where individuals may fear judgment or feel that their struggles are not valid. By fostering a therapeutic environment that emphasizes empathy, acceptance, and non-judgment, we can help clients feel safe in expressing their needs and seeking support.\n\nThe role of the counselor is not to dictate the path of therapy but to facilitate a dialogue that respects the client's autonomy and insights. This approach aligns with the postmodern view of therapy, where the client's perspective is valued and their goals are prioritized. By listening deeply and engaging with the client's narrative, counselors can help clients identify the resources and strengths they possess, which can be utilized to address their challenges.\n\nIn this case, the client's reflection on her relationships with friends and family provided valuable insights into her support network. Her interactions with her older sister, who practiced Buddhism and provided spiritual resources, were particularly noteworthy. While the client initially found these resources unhelpful, the gesture itself was a reminder of the support available to her. Exploring alternative ways to engage with these resources, such as incorporating mindfulness practices into her daily routine, could offer additional benefits.\n\nAnother important aspect of this case was the recognition of the client's character traits, such as holding grudges and being grateful. These traits can influence her interactions and coping mechanisms, and exploring them further could provide deeper insights into her anxiety. By understanding how these traits impact her relationships and self-perception, the client can develop more adaptive strategies for dealing with anxiety.\n\nThe homework assigned to the client was a practical exercise aimed at identifying potential sources of support. This task encouraged the client to think critically about her relationships and consider who she could turn to in times of need. By expanding her awareness of available resources, the client can develop a stronger support network, which is crucial for managing anxiety. \n\nIn conclusion, the process of psychological counseling is a journey of discovery and empowerment. It involves helping clients redefine their narratives, explore their strengths, and build supportive relationships. Through therapeutic dialogue, clients can let go of their anxieties and embrace a more fulfilling and connected life. As counselors, our role is to guide and support this process, fostering an environment where clients feel safe to explore, grow, and heal.", "causes": "Anxiety and hypochondriacal tendency triggered by financial pressure and family responsibilities.", "symptoms": "Anxiety with somatization symptoms such as chest tightness and shortness of breath.", "treatment_process": "Narrative therapy: helps the visitor separate anxiety from her identity through the concept of \"externalizing the problem,\" reframing her story to emphasize the existence of supportive relationships and resources around the visitor to alleviate anxiety;\n Homework: exercises to expand the visitor's awareness of available resources and build a stronger support network.", "characteristics_of_illness": "The limitations of the visitor's poor help-seeking mindset result in anxiety that is difficult to de-escalate.", "treatment_effect": "Through narrative therapy, the counselor helps the visitor to build a more powerful life story, explore the supportive relationships and resources around her, and enable her to deal with anxiety-provoking stressful events in a more positive frame of mind."}

However, when Angel is unhappy, her mother feels a hundred times more disappointed. Therefore, in front of her mother, Angel tries to maintain a positive, proactive, and optimistic attitude. Her parents often say that Angel is a very understanding, kind, and hardworking child."], "experience_and_reflection": "Based on Angel's family background, we will now delve deeper into the family system dynamics that influence Angel's romantic relationships from the perspective of family systems dynamics. This reflection aims to uncover the intricate layers of emotional and psychological factors that have shaped Angel's self-concept and relationship behaviors over time.\n\nFirstly, the motivation of being the top-ranked individual in her family has deeply influenced Angel's personality and approach to life. As the first child, Angel was the initial bearer of her parents' aspirations and expectations. This position often comes with a heavy burden of responsibility, and Angel was no exception. Her parents consistently urged her to be a role model for her younger brother, instilling in her a sense of duty and excellence. This upbringing fostered a strong desire in Angel to strive for perfection in all areas of her life, including her work. However, this relentless pursuit of excellence can lead to negative outcomes, such as self-doubt and a sense of failure when she falls short of her goals. This self-imposed pressure is also reflected in her romantic relationship, where her focus on achieving perfection in her career may have inadvertently led her to neglect her boyfriend's emotional needs and feelings, resulting in his perception that she does not truly understand life.\n\nCharacter motivation plays a significant role in Angel's behavior and emotional responses. Angel's happiness is intricately linked to her mother's emotional state; when Angel is happy, her mother is even happier, but when Angel is unhappy, her mother feels a hundred times more disappointed. This dynamic suggests that Angel's mother may have unresolved issues with her own mother, potentially stemming from a symbiotic relationship. As a result, Angel feels compelled to maintain a positive, active, and optimistic demeanor in her mother's presence. This pattern of behavior is further compounded by the absence of Angel's father, who is often busy with work and not physically present at home. Her mother, therefore, shoulders the responsibility of caring for both children, despite having a nanny to assist with household tasks. This lack of parental presence and emotional support may have led Angel to unconsciously adopt certain functions of her father and grandmother in her role, striving to fulfill the emotional void left by her father's absence.\n\nAngel's Chinese name, which carries the meanings of being \"knowledgeable and principled, sincere in dealing with others, and cherishing those around her,\" has exerted a powerful influence on her self-concept. Since childhood, Angel has been shaped by the implications of her name, gradually becoming the person it suggests. Consequently, she presents herself as friendly, gracious, and caring towards those around her, particularly in social settings. This self-concept is reinforced by her parents, who often describe Angel as a very sensible, kind, and hardworking child. These perceptions have seeped into Angel's subconscious, driving her to develop herself according to these ideals. As a result, Angel consistently applies herself diligently in her studies and work, setting high expectations for herself and, inadvertently, for her boyfriend. The pressure of these expectations may have contributed to the strain in their relationship.\n\nThe dynamics of parent-child relationships in Angel's family reveal a significant aspect of her emotional development. The lack of maternal empathy can lead to a deficiency in a child's sense of security. Without high-quality care, support, and assistance from parents, children may struggle to develop the ability to recognize and judge their own emotions, which in turn impedes their ability to understand others. This may be why Angel's boyfriend feels that, despite her attentive care, Angel fails to truly understand him. The four-year intimate relationship with her boyfriend, coupled with his supportive actions during the pandemic, fostered a sense of trust and reliance in Angel. However, the anxiety and accumulated work pressure resulting from the pandemic eventually overwhelmed Angel's rational control, leading her to express negative emotions she had previously suppressed. This emotional release may have placed an additional burden on her boyfriend, contributing to the breakdown of their relationship.\n\nThe dynamics of Angel's parents' marriage have also played a role in shaping her romantic relationship. Angel's father is caring and considerate towards her mother, even soothing her when she becomes unreasonable or angry. This dynamic has subtly transferred to Angel's relationship with her boyfriend, where she may unconsciously view herself as her mother and her boyfriend as her father. In other words, the marital dynamics of her parents have been replicated in her interactions with her boyfriend, leading to similar patterns of behavior and emotional responses.\n\nWhen we recognize that these family dynamics are affecting our relationship, it becomes essential to address them. The key lies in reconciling these unhealthy family dynamics to prevent their repetition in our lives. By reconciling with these influences, we can diminish their power to drain or harm our relationships and personal growth. For Angel, this reconciliation process involves acknowledging the impact of her family dynamics on her self-concept and relationships, and gradually detaching herself from these patterns.\n\nAs Angel progresses in reconciling these influences, she will begin to experience a profound transformation. She will no longer be bound by these dynamics, allowing her to accept and love herself authentically. This self-acceptance will enable Angel to live as her true self, free from the constraints of her family's expectations and the pressures she has internalized over the years. As she grows and evolves, her charm and presence will naturally change, offering her a renewed sense of confidence and appeal.\n\nWhen Angel reappears in front of her boyfriend with this newfound self-awareness and authenticity, she will present a version of herself that is markedly different from the past. This transformation may spark a second attraction, as her boyfriend perceives the changes in her demeanor and emotional resilience. The extent to which Angel reconciles with the influences affecting her relationship will directly correlate with the strength of this second attraction and the likelihood of reconciliation. By embracing her true self and relinquishing the burden of past family dynamics, Angel can pave the way for a healthier and more fulfilling relationship with her boyfriend, or with any future partner she chooses.\n\nUltimately, this reflection serves as a reminder of the profound impact that family dynamics can have on our lives and relationships. By understanding and addressing these influences, we can empower ourselves to break free from the patterns that no longer serve us and embrace a life of authenticity, growth, and genuine connection with others.", "causes": "Replicating parents' relationship patterns due to family of origin influences, resulting in failed relationships and sadness.", "symptoms": "Sadness, pain, wanting to get back her boyfriend's heart.", "treatment_process": "Systemic Family Therapy: By combing through Angel's family upbringing, the first in line, the high expectations of her parents cultivated the visitor's pursuit of perfection, and the symbiotic relationship with her mother led to Angel's habit of displaying her own optimistic and positive attitudes, and suppressing her inner negative thoughts.

The colleague mentioned that her sister's child has become quite something; originally, she would quietly take small change from home, but now she has escalated to taking hundred-dollar bills from her parents' wallets. Her boldness has increased to the point where she even stole 200 yuan from her aunt last time. The colleague's sister asked her (the colleague) to help look after the child, saying she no longer wanted the child because she couldn't bear the shame. My colleague felt anxious, helpless, and troubled, and asked for my advice. I told her that there are often other reasons behind a child's lying; the child may not necessarily be \"stealing for love of money.\" My colleague seemed to grasp onto this as a lifeline and brought her sister, brother-in-law, and their two children to my consulting room. \n\nUpon understanding the situation, I learned that my colleague's brother-in-law is a high school graduate working in real estate development, busy all day like a spinning top, and by the time he gets home, the children are usually asleep, leaving very little opportunity for communication with them. My colleague's sister graduated from junior high and is a full-time mother. Her husband lovingly tells her not to worry about money but to ensure the children eat well and maintain good grades, aiming for them to be among the top 10 students each year and to be recognized as model students.\n\nThe sister told me that although the family's financial situation is good, she worries about spoiling the children and rarely gives them pocket money. All household expenses, whether the children ask for them or not, are covered by the mother through her purchases at the supermarket, and she is very strict with discipline. The children are only responsible for studying at home. The mother’s approach is endorsed by the children, who feel the management is indeed strict. When the parents discovered that the child had a habit of stealing money, they thought it was too shameful and secretly subjected her to severe punishment several times, even denying her sleep, yet they still did not uncover the reasons behind the stealing and lying, and the lying habit only worsened! \n\nFrustration + distress + irritability + shame led them to decide to cast her out of the house! I employed various counseling techniques, such as empathy and allowing her to express herself. The child actively communicated with me, revealing that she was secretly helping her older brother with his homework because she didn't want him to be punished by their mother for not completing it. The stealing was motivated by her desire to buy a small bucket for the class, a shuttlecock for each girl, and a soccer ball for the boys to win their support, hoping to be elected as a model student at the end of the term. \n\nUpon hearing her child's account, the mother fell silent in shame. Of course, after communication and treatment, the child now has a good relationship with her parents, and she is happy, cheerful, and positive. This situation exposed many family issues. I just want to tell parents here: when your child lies, do you resort to \"harsh punishment,\" or do you reflect and seek to understand the truth behind the child's lies?"], "experience_and_reflection": "The journey of understanding the complexities behind children's lies is both intricate and revealing. Lies told by children can be a source of concern for parents, often leading to feelings of frustration, embarrassment, or shame. However, as a psychological counselor specializing in child development and parent-child relationships, it is crucial to delve deeper into the underlying causes and motivations behind these behaviors. This reflection aims to expand upon the core insights of my initial analysis, incorporating further clinical perspectives and insights gained from the presented case study.\n\nChildren are inherently imaginative beings, and this rich imagination often blurs the lines between fantasy and reality. This is not indicative of deceit but rather a developmental stage where they experiment with their perceptions of the world. Parents may mistakenly label these imaginative narratives as lies, not realizing that their child's cognitive development is still in its formative stages. This misinterpretation can lead to a cycle of misunderstanding and unwarranted punishment, which can stifle a child's natural creativity and hinder open communication.\n\nMoreover, children's lies are frequently a bid for attention. In our fast-paced lives, where parental presence may be limited due to professional obligations, children often resort to behaviors that will elicit a response, even if it is negative. It is imperative to understand that for a child, any attention—be it disciplinary or affectionate—validates their existence and importance in their parents' lives. This case exemplifies how a child's need to feel valued and recognized within the family unit can manifest as dishonest behavior, not out of malice but as a cry for connection.\n\nInadequate parental guidance and the modeling of behavior play significant roles in shaping a child's propensity to lie. Children learn by observing the actions and attitudes of their parents, who are their primary role models. If children witness their parents engaging in deceptive practices, even small ones justified as harmless, it can create a cognitive dissonance where lying seems permissible. This case highlights the importance of parents embodying honesty and integrity, as their actions lay the foundation for their children's moral compass.\n\nChildren's susceptibility to suggestion is another pivotal factor. The way adults frame questions can inadvertently lead children to fabricate responses that align with what they perceive is expected of them. This susceptibility underscores the need for parents and educators to be mindful of their language, opting for open-ended questions that encourage honest dialogue rather than inadvertently leading the child toward falsehoods.\n\nThe case further illustrates that children's lies often stem from a desire to fulfill unmet needs or desires. In situations where they lack the means or permission to achieve what they want, they may resort to dishonesty as a coping mechanism. The child in the case study was driven by a commendable desire to support her peers and gain their approval, yet her approach led her down a path of deception. This scenario sheds light on the importance of understanding the root of a child's desires and finding constructive ways to help them achieve their goals.\n\nFear is a powerful motivator for lying, particularly when children face harsh or punitive responses from authority figures. The fear of punishment can overshadow a child's ability to communicate truthfully, pushing them toward lies as a means of self-preservation. It is vital for parents to create an environment where mistakes are viewed as opportunities for learning rather than occasions for severe reprimand. This case underscores the necessity of replacing fear-based discipline with approaches that foster understanding and growth.\n\nAs we explore the dimensions of confronting lies, it becomes evident that the lies of children are fundamentally different from those of adults. They are not born out of a fully developed understanding of deceit but rather from an evolving psychological and cognitive landscape. Parents must shift their perspective from viewing lies as moral failings to recognizing them as part of their child's developmental journey.\n\nReplacing harsh punishment with love and acceptance can transform the parent-child relationship. When children are met with compassion and understanding, they are more likely to open up about their thoughts and feelings. This approach not only addresses the behavior but also reinforces the child's worth and importance within the family. It is crucial for parents to communicate that their love is unconditional and that mistakes do not diminish their child's value.\n\nUnderstanding and responding to a child's inner feelings requires empathy and patience. Children need to feel that their emotions are acknowledged and respected. By validating their feelings, parents can create a safe space for their children to express themselves honestly. This approach fosters trust and openness, allowing for meaningful conversations that uncover the reasons behind the child's actions.\n\nProviding more attention and care can significantly reduce the instances of lying. Children thrive in environments where they feel seen, heard, and valued. In the case study, the child's actions were driven by a need for recognition and approval. By nurturing a strong emotional connection and prioritizing quality time, parents can reinforce their child's self-esteem and reduce the likelihood of attention-seeking behavior through dishonesty.\n\nHolding the child accountable for their actions is a crucial step in their development. Encouraging direct communication about their needs and desires helps children understand the importance of honesty and integrity. Establishing clear agreements and boundaries fosters a sense of responsibility and empowers children to make ethical choices.\n\nReflecting on this case, it is evident that lies in children are multi-faceted and deeply intertwined with their developmental stages and family dynamics. As parents and caregivers, it is our responsibility to approach these situations with a mindset of curiosity and compassion, seeking to understand the underlying motivations rather than rushing to judgment. Through empathy, open communication, and a nurturing environment, we can guide our children toward honesty and integrity, equipping them with the tools they need to navigate the complexities of the world with confidence and authenticity.\n\nIn closing, this case serves as a poignant reminder of the power of empathy and understanding in parenting. It challenges us to look beyond the surface of a child's behavior and to consider the myriad factors that contribute to their actions. By doing so, we not only strengthen our relationship with our children but also pave the way for their emotional and moral development, ensuring they grow into individuals who value honesty, integrity, and connection.", "causes": "Children's lying and money stealing behaviors triggered by harsh parental discipline and high expectations.", "symptoms": "The child's lying and money stealing behavior causes embarrassment and shame to the parents.", "treatment_process": "Listening and empathy: By creating a safe and trusting relationship, the child is willing to open up to the counselor and express the reasons behind his/her lying and stealing (to prevent his/her older brother from being criticized by the parents, and stealing money from classmates for support in order to live up to the parents' expectations of being a model student).", "characteristics_of_illness": "Children are still in the cognitive formation stage, blurring the line between reality and imagination, and are not consciously deceitful.", "treatment_effect": "Through listening and empathy techniques, the counselor allows the child to express himself/herself safely and helps the parents to realize that behind the child's lying is attention-seeking and peer-approval-seeking, so that they can change their strict parenting style and give more understanding and attention to the child."}
{"id": 119, "case_description": ["Visitor, male, 36 years old, vocational school graduate, white-collar management staff in a company, married for 9 years, with two boys: one 8 years old and one 4 years old, a department manager in a domestic listed company. His wife comes from a rural background and works with him in the company. The visitor is excessively concerned about his health (health anxiety) and suspects he has obsessive-compulsive disorder. He hopes to undergo a practical psychological test and also receive some psychological counseling."], "consultation_process": ["Consultation date: July 5, 2018", "3. Consultation goal: How to alleviate my fear of AIDS?", "IV. Consultation Process: The 36-year-old visitor was originally just a rural migrant worker. After more than a decade of hard work, he is now a department manager at a listed company, earning over 20,000 yuan a month and owning multiple properties, with fixed assets totaling 10 million yuan. As his status changed, the visitor increasingly felt that his unsophisticated, uneducated wife was unworthy of him, and he developed a deep-seated disdain for her. He came from a poor rural background and got married for the first time at the age of 23, only to find that his wife was a mental health patient who stayed at home all day and was unable to have children. The visitor did not recognize this marriage and divorced his first wife two years later after compensating her with 70,000 yuan. During the period after his divorce, the visitor met his current wife, Xiaoyu, online. Xiaoyu is a rural girl from the mountains of Gansu, who, after working in Beijing for a few years, planned to return home to get married. Xiaoyu initially intended to introduce the visitor to one of her friends, but after spending some time together, she discovered that he was articulate, intelligent, and had his own opinions. She thought such a man was reliable and promising, so she decided to marry him. Thus, Xiaoyu disregarded her parents' objections and traveled alone from Gansu to join the visitor in Beijing. The visitor mentioned that he didn't initially find Xiaoyu attractive, but given that his family was not wealthy and he was divorced, he felt fortunate to have a girl willing to marry him under those circumstances. He had hoped to find a beautiful, educated, and cultured woman, but considering his situation, he questioned which educated, cultured, young, and beautiful woman would be willing to marry him. The visitor repeatedly emphasized that neither of his marriages was based on love; both were compromises made due to his circumstances at the time, and he reiterated that he came from a poor background and did not have good looks, which led him to settle for less, highlighting his deep-seated insecurity.", "V. Personal Analysis: Although the visitor is now middle class and a white-collar worker, he cannot hide his inner feelings of inferiority. He seeks psychological compensation through physical possession of young, beautiful girls. However, due to deep-seated moral constraints, he does not want to ruin his marriage and family, so he dares not openly engage in extramarital affairs and can only seek temporary psychological and physiological satisfaction in nightclubs. As the visitor himself said, “I have the heart of a thief but not the courage.” Although he has only been to nightclubs twice, each time afterward brings him great pressure and pain. His overly sensitive and perfectionist personality has made him very concerned about his body since childhood, always fearing he might contract a serious illness or even a terminal disease. Each time he has sexual relations with a prostitute, he takes strict precautions, but still feels anxious afterward. Despite multiple tests at the hospital, he remains uneasy. Since the exclusion period for HIV infection is three months, not a day goes by during those three months without fear! Yet he cannot resist the temptation of young, beautiful women and is always tempted to try again. A few days ago, he went to a foot massage parlor and, to prevent contracting HIV, he specifically brought testing strips. After testing, he only allowed the prostitute to touch his lower body without engaging in sexual intercourse. Even so, he returned home still worried about contracting a sexually transmitted disease. Upon inquiring with relevant departments, he was told that this does not constitute high-risk behavior and does not require intervention, yet the visitor remains unconvinced and sought psychological counseling online. The online counselor suspected he had obsessive-compulsive disorder and suggested he take an OCD tendency test, which led him to my counseling room. In fact, the visitor is what people commonly refer to as having \"HIV phobia,\" which is similar to hypochondria and falls under the category of obsessive-compulsive disorders. So why didn’t I give the visitor an OCD tendency test? I had already prepared the testing scale, but the reason I didn't administer it is that if the test results were positive, it would further increase the visitor's psychological burden without being helpful; if the results were negative, would the visitor believe it? The local disease control center clearly told him that his recent contact with the opposite sex did not constitute high-risk behavior and there was no need to worry, yet the visitor continues to seek consultations everywhere. His issue is psychological; “the heart's ailment requires a heart remedy,” and there is no need for medication. Therefore, conducting these tests is unnecessary; it is sufficient to recognize that the visitor has psychological issues. Furthermore, the postmodern concept of psychological counseling is de-pathologization, which makes testing scales even less necessary!"], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on the therapeutic journey with this client, it's clear that the process unveiled intricate layers of his psyche, each intertwined with his past and present experiences. Initially, the client articulated three primary goals: enhancing his marriage, alleviating his fear of AIDS, and reducing his excessive health anxieties. These goals, while seemingly distinct, were interconnected by a common thread of insecurity and self-worth issues that have been a constant in his life narrative.\n\nThe client’s background reveals a trajectory from a humble rural upbringing to a middle-class lifestyle, which has not been without its psychological toll. His deep-seated feelings of inferiority, exacerbated by his rapid socio-economic ascent, manifest as compulsive health anxieties, often referred to as \"HIV phobia.\" This phobia, similar to hypochondria, is rooted in obsessive-compulsive tendencies. The client's insistence on undergoing psychological tests, despite reassurances from medical professionals, highlights his reliance on external validation to quell internal fears. This reliance reflects a significant aspect of his psychological makeup: a profound lack of self-trust and an overdependence on external authorities to define his reality and safety.\n\nThe decision not to conduct an OCD tendency test was deliberate, rooted in the understanding that a positive result could exacerbate his distress, while a negative result might be dismissed due to his pervasive doubts. This aligns with the postmodern approach in psychotherapy, emphasizing de-pathologization and focusing on narrative therapy. By reshaping his personal narrative, the client can begin to perceive his fears not as pathological disorders but as narratives that can be rewritten. This approach also encourages the client to internalize his sense of safety and self-worth, rather than seeking it through external measures.\n\nThe consultation process illuminated the complex dynamics within his marriage. Initially, he perceived his relationship as a compromise, a sentiment stemming from his low self-esteem and his belief that his options were limited due to his perceived lack of attractiveness and wealth. Over time, however, there was a noticeable shift. The client began to appreciate his wife's role in his life, recognizing her contributions to family stability and cohesion. This newfound appreciation marked a critical turning point in addressing his marital dissatisfaction, as it redirected his focus from external appearances to intrinsic values.\n\nThe client's preoccupation with young, attractive women further illustrates his internal conflict and search for validation. His ventures into nightclubs, driven by a desire for physical affirmation, were fraught with guilt and anxiety, indicative of the moral and emotional constraints he felt bound by. These experiences underscore a recurring theme in his life: the pursuit of an idealized self-image that conflicts with his current reality. This pursuit is symptomatic of his perfectionist tendencies, which have led to a cycle of dissatisfaction and longing for an unattainable ideal.\n\nIn exploring the origins of his health anxieties, the client recounted significant losses in his life, including the early death of a childhood friend and the terminal illnesses of relatives. These experiences have undoubtedly contributed to a pervasive fear of death and illness, rooted in a lack of existential security. This existential insecurity appears to be a driving force behind his obsessive health concerns, as he seeks to exert control over the one aspect of life that is inherently unpredictable: mortality.\n\nDuring our sessions, it became evident that the client's issues were not merely symptomatic of OCD but were deeply entrenched in his life story and self-concept. His excessive health concerns and marital dissatisfaction were manifestations of a broader struggle with self-worth and identity. By employing narrative therapy, the goal was to empower him to reauthor his life story, shifting from a narrative of inadequacy and fear to one of acceptance and self-compassion.\n\nThe shift in his perspective on marriage is particularly noteworthy. By the end of our consultations, he had begun to view his wife not as a reflection of his compromises but as a partner whose strengths complemented his own. This shift was facilitated by a deeper understanding of his own values and needs, and the realization that the ideal partner he longed for may have been a projection of his unmet desires for self-validation.\n\nIn addressing his fear of AIDS and health anxieties, the consultations focused on redirecting his attention from external symptoms to internal narratives. By identifying the underlying fears driving these obsessions, we could address the root causes rather than just the symptoms. This approach involved encouraging the client to engage in activities that fostered mindfulness and presence, such as reading and listening to music, which he had previously used as coping mechanisms.\n\nOur discussions also delved into the societal and cultural factors influencing his perceptions and desires. The client’s comments about people being \"cheap\" and his dissatisfaction with his wife's obedience reflect a broader societal narrative that equates value with external attributes such as beauty and independence. By challenging these narratives, the client was encouraged to redefine what constitutes a fulfilling relationship and a successful life, based on his own experiences and values rather than societal expectations.\n\nThe reflections on this case underscore the importance of understanding the client's life story in its entirety, recognizing that psychological symptoms are often manifestations of deeper existential issues. By focusing on narrative therapy and de-pathologization, the therapeutic process aimed to empower the client to redefine his identity and relationships, fostering a more integrated and fulfilling life. This approach acknowledges that the heart's ailment indeed requires a heart remedy, one that is as much about healing the narrative as it is about addressing the symptoms.", "causes": "AIDS phobia due to extramarital sex.", "symptoms": "Fear of getting AIDS, obsessive-compulsive and hypochondriacal behavior.", "treatment_process": "Narrative therapy: Through sorting out the visitor's life story (social advancement, two unsatisfactory marriages, fear of death due to childhood trauma of peer death), the visitor is guided to recreate her own life story, from a narrative of inadequacy and fear to one of acceptance and self-compassion.", "characteristics_of_illness": "The client's pursuit of an idealized self-image that is in conflict with current reality and the constraints of social morality, a psychological conflict that triggers obsessive-compulsive tendencies in the client.", "treatment_effect": "Through narrative therapy and depathologization, the client is empowered to redefine her identity and relationships (seeing her wife as a partner who complements her strengths) to facilitate a more complete and fulfilling life."}

The father's seriousness creates a sense of \"emasculation\" anxiety in the child, and the child's feelings of inferiority stem from the stern father, where he feels small in comparison to the powerful, strict father, unable to catch up or surpass him no matter how hard he tries. Therefore, if a boy is surrounded by his father's gentleness, he is more likely to approach his father and learn many survival skills through imitation. The mother's absence before he turns three leads to significant setbacks in his attachment relationships, which is a major psychological challenge that HH faces in his emotional development, influencing all his behavioral responses. In the time to come, the mother should provide a nurturing environment that allows him to feel her presence while also being filled with challenges.", "(Counselor Observation)", "At first, he was a little boy who seemed completely unable to bear grievances, but he also relied heavily on strong power.

A holding environment refers to an environment that has healing significance for a child's psyche. On one hand, it is important to encourage children to express their emotions, especially through verbal means; on the other hand, parents and other important family members should \"hold\" these emotions, accepting and melting them before the child can fully grasp them; finally, these held emotions should be transformed into positive emotions and conveyed back to the child. The entire cycle flows like a vibrant, rushing river.", "(parent-child relationship)", "In the parent-child relationship, the father's seriousness pushed him away; the mother's indifference also pushed him away. Therefore, he did not learn how to properly express the strength of his masculine side or express his love in early parent-child relationships.

He lacked a deep sense of security and remained stuck in an infantile sense of omnipotence.", "Summary/Suggestions: When dealing with parent-child interactions with HH, the father should close the distance with him. At this time, the father needs to show tenderness rather than strictness. What he needs most now is his father. The mother can assist by gently guiding him towards his father, who should be ready to embrace him. Only with such a parent-child relationship can his personality be fundamentally stabilized and support his healthy development on a psychological level.", "(Relationship with siblings)", "The arrival of his sister was undoubtedly a blow to him, as the love that was already insufficient was now being contested by another person. At first, he thought that as a boy, he could emerge victorious in the competition with his sister. However, in reality, almost the entire family's attention was focused on her, which once again frustrated his self-esteem, making him feel that he was inherently unloved. As a result, he expressed his anger towards his sister in other ways, such as thinking that he could gain his parents' attention by becoming a girl like her or by becoming irritable and strong like his father to draw attention.", "Summary/Suggestion: The essence of sibling relationships is a balance of competition and cooperation; many people's competitive abilities are learned through parent-child interactions and interactions with siblings. HH's friendliness towards his sister indicates that he needs more attention from his parents. Therefore, when he shows kindness to his sister, it is important to remind him, \"HH, Mom and Dad have always loved you very much.\"", "(Intergenerational relationship)", "In this world, the farthest distance is the distance between a grandmother and her grandson, which can create pressure in a child's growth. As the grandson of his grandparents, he is certainly loved dearly. However, the love from grandparents cannot replace the love of parents, because grandparents' love often expresses a sense of responsibility. This sense of responsibility can seem quite limited compared to that of parents.", "Summary/Suggestions: He grew up around his grandmother and maternal grandmother. As a result, during his early years, especially during sensitive periods, his subtle psychological needs did not receive timely responses. This led to a feeling of emotional neglect, resulting in psychological trauma. This trauma later evolved into excessive demands on others, especially on intimate individuals; if these demands were met, he would feel anger, hatred, and aggression. From now on, parents need to be closely attuned to his needs and try to meet or delay fulfilling them as much as possible. After his needs are met, they should tell him, \"Child, you have always been cared for. If you feel unmet, it is not because we abandoned you, but because we may not have understood your meaning.\" This phrase should be repeated frequently.", "(Relationship with classmates)", "HH has a fluctuating relationship with his classmates.

After the teacher empathized with him, he became obedient and was able to follow the teacher's requests.", "Summary/Suggestion: Parents should become his mentors and friends, rather than just being pressure-filled figures. In the upcoming education, parents can communicate with him in a consultative manner. Opportunities for parallel dialogue should be created in their relationship, allowing him to experience a new kind of parent, which will lead to a new understanding of himself."], "experience_and_reflection": "After 58 hours of companionship and therapy, HH has made significant progress in both the sadistic and masochistic aspects, being able to express their emotions and needs verbally. This development marks a pivotal moment in our therapeutic journey and provides a rich tapestry of insights into the underlying dynamics of HH's emotional world, relationships, and the interplay between his environment and innate personality traits.\n\nAt the onset of our sessions, HH presented with a complex psychological profile characterized by a profound victim mentality, which was further compounded by an underlying aggressive tendency. This duality appeared as a manifestation of unspeakable anger and confusion, rooted deeply within his psyche. It became evident that the environment in which HH was growing was not conducive to nurturing his emotional needs adequately. The authoritative presence of his father, coupled with the initial absence of his mother during crucial developmental phases, fostered a sense of emasculation anxiety. HH felt dwarfed by his father's stern demeanor, creating a backdrop of inferiority and a perpetual struggle to meet the lofty expectations set before him.\n\nThe therapeutic process centered around creating a 'holding environment,' a concept pivotal in facilitating emotional healing and growth. This environment was meticulously crafted to allow HH to articulate his emotions and to provide a safe space where these emotions could be 'held' by the therapist, processed, and eventually transformed into constructive feelings. This cyclical process was akin to a vibrant river, facilitating a fluid and dynamic exchange between HH's internal experiences and the external support system provided in therapy.\n\nOne of the notable challenges in HH's psychological landscape was his interaction with authority figures, particularly his father. The father's seriousness, which was perceived by HH as distant and unapproachable, hindered the development of a healthy masculine identity. It was essential to encourage the father to bridge this emotional gap by adopting a more gentle approach, thereby closing the distance and fostering a nurturing father-son relationship. This recommendation was aimed at establishing a foundation for HH to model a balanced expression of strength and affection, which he struggled to manifest due to early relational dynamics.\n\nThe introduction of HH's sister further complicated his emotional experiences. The sibling relationship, marked by competition and a struggle for parental affection, intensified HH's feelings of inadequacy and unloved status. This was exacerbated by his observation that his sister seemed to capture the family's attention effortlessly. Such dynamics prompted HH to contemplate assuming roles that might garner parental focus, either by mimicking his sister's demeanor or adopting aggressive traits akin to his father's. Addressing this aspect required reinforcing HH's intrinsic value and ensuring he felt equally cherished, regardless of the familial shifts that naturally occur with the arrival of a sibling.\n\nIntergenerational relationships also played a crucial role in shaping HH's psychological framework. Growing up under the care of his grandmothers, he experienced a form of love that, while sincere, lacked the immediacy and depth required to fully meet his emotional needs during sensitive developmental periods. This resulted in an emotional neglect that translated into excessive demands on intimate relationships later in life. Therapeutically, it was vital to address these unmet needs and reframe them, allowing HH to understand that any perceived neglect was not due to abandonment but rather a misalignment in understanding his complex emotional language.\n\nHH's interpersonal relationships with peers echoed the unresolved dynamics from his family interactions. His fluctuating relationships with classmates revealed a 'dominant-submissive' pattern, indicative of his internalized struggle with authority and power. This pattern was a reenactment of his parent-child relationship dynamics, suggesting a heart filled with unresolved anger and hatred. Through therapy, it was important to reestablish a sense of security and guide HH in relearning healthier interaction patterns, thus allowing him to experience relationships devoid of the need to dominate or submit.\n\nFurthermore, HH's relationship with teachers highlighted his challenges in communicating needs and responding to authority. His reactions to unmet needs often manifested in aggressive behavior, a reflection of his broader struggles with authority figures. Therapeutic interventions focused on fostering a consultative relationship between HH and his parents, transforming them from figures of pressure to mentors and friends. This approach aimed to enable HH to experience a new kind of parental relationship, encouraging a deeper understanding of himself and fostering a sense of autonomy and self-worth.\n\nOverall, the therapeutic journey with HH has been profound, revealing intricate layers of emotional and psychological dynamics influenced by his environment, familial relationships, and innate personality traits. As HH continues to progress, the focus remains on solidifying these gains, ensuring that he feels supported and understood, and empowering him to navigate his emotional world with greater confidence and resilience. Through ongoing therapy and family support, HH's path toward emotional stability and healthy development is becoming increasingly apparent, promising a brighter future where he can thrive and express his full potential.", "causes": "Attachment disorders and victim mentality in children due to absence of parental nurturer, fear of authority.", "symptoms": "Excessive need for intimacy, fear of fathers and teachers, unconscious victim mentality with potential aggression in interactions with peers.", "treatment_process": "Play therapy: The child's family upbringing is analyzed, with the father's strictness leading to low self-esteem, the mother's absence until the age of three leading to attachment disorders, and the emotional neglect leading to insecurity, vulnerability, and an excessive need for intimacy.

The counselor structures the mainstream culture, listens to Xinxin's inner voice, and helps her understand that she does not need to follow the expectations of mainstream culture in everything, nor does she have to be controlled by the mainstream voice; the mainstream voice is not the only voice.

Xinxin's journey through therapy underscores the power of storytelling in reshaping one's identity and understanding of self. Her experience reveals how pervasive cultural narratives can overshadow individual desires and lead to internal conflict. Through our sessions, we were able to externalize these conflicts, allowing Xinxin to detach her self-worth from societal expectations and to see herself not as a failure, but as an autonomous individual capable of making her own choices.\n\nInitially, Xinxin's narrative was dominated by a sense of \"failure\" and \"unworthiness\" as a woman due to her decision not to have children. This is a testament to the strength of societal narratives that equate womanhood with motherhood. In our culture, these narratives are so deeply ingrained that they can become internalized as personal inadequacies. By externalizing Xinxin's feelings of failure, we began to dismantle the power they held over her. Naming these feelings allowed Xinxin to see them as separate from her identity, which was crucial in beginning the process of rewriting her narrative.\n\nOur work together was a profound exploration of identity beyond the traditional roles ascribed by society. In deconstructing Xinxin's narrative, we uncovered subplots that illuminated her true values and desires. These subplots revealed a woman who was loving, joyful, and deeply fulfilled by her role as an aunt. They highlighted her capacity for nurturing and connection, which were not dependent on motherhood. This revelation was vital in helping Xinxin construct a new self-identity that honored her desires and choices.\n\nThe process of narrative therapy allowed Xinxin to shift her focus from societal expectations to her own values. This shift was not immediate; it required the delicate peeling away of layers of internalized beliefs and fears. Through our dialogues, Xinxin began to recognize that the mainstream narrative of womanhood was not a universal truth but a cultural construct. This understanding was liberating for her. It provided the cognitive and emotional space to listen to her local voice, which had been overshadowed by external pressures.\n\nThe concept of \"local voices\" in narrative therapy was a critical component of Xinxin's journey. Her local voice, which resisted the mainstream narrative, was initially faint and burdened by self-doubt. As we progressed, Xinxin's local voice grew stronger, supported by the subplots we unearthed. She realized that her decision to remain child-free was not a reflection of inadequacy but a legitimate and fulfilling choice. This realization was empowering and helped to build a new narrative that was authentic to her.\n\nOur sessions also addressed the societal expectation that fulfillment and completeness for women are achieved through motherhood. This narrative is deeply embedded in our cultural psyche and often goes unchallenged, leading many women to doubt their worth when they deviate from this path. In working with Xinxin, I saw the necessity of challenging such monolithic narratives and highlighting the diversity of women's experiences and identities.\n\nOne of the most significant aspects of Xinxin's therapy was the migration of her narrative from one of self-doubt and imposed inadequacy to one of self-defined completeness and joy. This migration was facilitated by her growing understanding that the voices of relatives and society were not the only voices that mattered. Her own voice, once amplified, became a powerful tool for her to rewrite her story. This process reflects the broader therapeutic goal of narrative therapy: to empower clients to become the authors of their own lives.\n\nThe journey also reinforced the importance of creating a safe space where clients can explore and redefine their narratives without fear of judgment. Xinxin needed a therapeutic environment where she could express her fears and desires openly. This environment allowed her to confront the internalized narratives that were causing her distress and to begin constructing a narrative that was congruent with her values and aspirations.\n\nThrough our work, Xinxin came to understand that her worth as a woman was not contingent upon fulfilling societal expectations of motherhood. This realization was pivotal in reshaping her identity and sense of self-worth. It was a reminder of the therapeutic power of narrative therapy in helping individuals reclaim their narratives from the constraints of societal norms.\n\nIn concluding this reflection, Xinxin's case has underscored the profound impact of narrative therapy on identity formation and self-perception. By externalizing problems and exploring subplots, clients can gain new insights into their lives and choices. This process is not just about resolving immediate issues but about fostering a deeper understanding of self and the freedom to live authentically. Xinxin's journey is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the transformative potential of therapy in helping individuals find their voice amidst the clamor of societal expectations.", "causes": "Depressive tendencies arising from the conflict between the participant's choice not to have children and the socio-cultural demands of motherhood on women.", "symptoms": "Depression, insomnia, belief that she is a failure and unworthy of being a woman.", "treatment_process": "Narrative therapy: By creating a safe counseling environment, the client is able to re-explore and redefine her life narrative without the fear of judgment.

{"id": 122, "case_description": ["Ms. A (pseudonym), female, born in the 1980s, office worker, breakup recovery."], "consultation_process": ["Consultation Summary: The visitor, Ms. A, works at a company. She is 35 years old, unmarried, and lives in a first-tier city. Ms. A sought the help of a counselor due to arguments and a breakup with her boyfriend. She has a relatively typical anxious personality. A notable characteristic of Ms. A is that, due to her higher education and limited dating experience, she has a deep understanding of what is right and wrong in her thinking. This aligns with the common saying about \"the artistic youth's feelings.\" In relationships, Ms. A often lacks a sense of security, especially after arguments; she usually finds it hard to apologize first and insists that her partner should come to her instead, requiring them to patiently comfort her before she forgives. However, she secretly wants to reconnect, just unwilling to show it due to pride. Ms. A's ex-boyfriend, Mr. D, exhibits a more avoidant personality. He enjoys cooking, is not very ambitious in his career, and prefers a simple life. Additionally, Mr. D has a lower level of education compared to Ms. A, leading to significant differences in their perspectives. During their cohabitation, Ms. A often criticized Mr. D and was indifferent to his existing strengths, such as cooking and doing housework. As a result, Mr. D's feelings for Ms. A began to diminish. Their breakup was marked by Ms. A's anxiety, indecision, and insecurity, leading to a cycle of breaking up and getting back together. Ms. A expressed anger multiple times, and although Mr. D initially moved out of their shared apartment, she later reached out to him for help with fixing the television, air conditioning, and paying rent, without apologizing. When Mr. D returned, Ms. A would want him to hold and comfort her. After a period of improved relations, Ms. A again expressed disdain and anger toward Mr. D, causing their relationship to deteriorate once more. This cycle continued until Mr. D resorted to silent treatment, completely ignoring Ms. A.\n\nExperience and Insights: Summary of Consultation: 1. Ms. A is an intellectual woman, but the higher her education and knowledge, the more difficult it is for her to change her perceptions. In relationships, one must learn to \"play dumb\"; the more one overanalyzes morals and logic, the more trouble one invites into their love life. Instead of trying to reason with one another, it’s more beneficial to enjoy a wonderful date, intimate touch, or even passionate moments together. The attraction between the two initially wasn't based on reasoning; it was more about comfort and charm. The feeling of comfort should exist for both parties; otherwise, many arguments are based on issues of your own making. 2. Given that Ms. A is relatively reserved, has limited dating experience, and is educated, she can be compliant but also resistant at times. Therefore, my strategy for her is a standard separation-based reconciliation approach: first, no contact for two weeks to rebuild attraction, then post on social media for a while before attempting to reconnect. 3. I guided Ms. A to post the following on her social media: (1) Request: Find an event related to Children's Day tonight; if unable to participate, just take a few photos. Ideally, include herself in the photos. Theme: Children's Day, expressing love. Text: \"Haven't celebrated June 1st in a long time (with a mischievous smile emoji). Playing with all the little ones is so carefree (with a frowning emoji). I want to be a child again!\" Image requirements: 3-6 images, including 1-2 with her and others capturing various activities of children. (2) Theme: Five Love Languages. Text: \"On a friend's recommendation, I read a book on emotional intelligence. I realized I often have overly high expectations of those close to me due to my family background and upbringing. The book emphasized accepting our differences and focusing on feelings in communication to understand each other better. A great book; sharing an image.\" Image requirements: One cover photo and pictures from chapters on emotional management, acceptance, and empathy. (3) Theme: Drawing (I will provide the drawing images). Text: \"Picking up the long-abandoned paintbrush to cultivate my mind. Guess what my drawing expresses? (with a playful emoji).\" Image requirements: Provided by the counselor. (4) Theme: Running. Text: \"Morning run check-in! The weather is great and fresh; running is healthier (with a determined emoji). If it’s an evening run: Evening run check-in! Finished work, time to move, shake off the stress, lose some weight, and forget my worries after running.\" Image requirements: Pictures of the morning/evening streets, scenery, and a selfie in sportswear. (5) Theme: Gathering with friends, preferably in a larger group. Text: \"Reconnecting with old study abroad friends today; had a great time eating and catching up. Everyone seems to be doing well; I need to keep pushing myself (with a determined emoji).\" Image: Photos of the meal and various scenes together. (6) Theme: Cooking, preferably Western cuisine, steak, fruit salad, and wine, with two glasses. Text: \"Haven't treated myself well in a while! I used to rely on others for meals, but now I'm cooking for myself and feeling fulfilled (with a mischievous smile emoji). After making this meal, life feels full of joy and achievement!\" Image: Arrange freely, but with a high-quality and appealing effect. Can include: a raw steak, a finished photo of steak and fruit salad, a photo of two wine glasses filled, and a table photo with candles if possible. (7) Theme: Five Love Languages. Text: \"Mark Twain: A compliment can sustain me for two months. Feeling the importance of recognizing and praising others again! Highly recommend this book!\" Image: A few pictures depicting the five love languages. (8) Theme: Cleaning the house. Text: \"Moved into a new place but haven’t properly organized it. Today, I’m becoming a cleanliness angel, getting rid of clutter and cleaning up, hoping to clear out the past and embrace a new day (with a determined emoji).\" Image: Photos of a tidy room. (9) Theme: Soccer. Text: \"Although I’m a casual fan, I used to watch soccer. The World Cup is buzzing everywhere; I really want to see it live (with a teary-eyed emoji).\" Image: Share an article about the World Cup opening. (10) Theme: Shared memories—spicy food. Text: \"Feeling suddenly sentimental, so I ran in for a big meal. They say eating spicy food can boost hormones and lift one’s mood. Does eating extremely spicy food bring about a wild romance feeling? (with a face-palm emoji) It was really spicy, beyond what I’ve experienced before.\" Image: Food photos. (11) Theme: Shared memories—The Shawshank Redemption. Text: \"Suddenly wanted to watch a movie, flipped through for a long time not knowing what to pick. Let’s revisit this classic. Watching it for the second time is still deeply moving.\" Image: Screenshot of rewatching The Shawshank Redemption. 4. After two weeks of posting on social media, I guided Ms. A to read some books on emotional management and discussed her and Mr. D's personalities. I encouraged Ms. A to try reaching out to Mr. D. Like other visitors, Ms. A felt nervous and scared when contacting Mr. D, as they had gotten used to the coldness between them. She was afraid he wouldn’t respond but also hoped for a reply, worrying that it might not be what she wanted. Due to her anxiety, I only allowed her to send a simple message asking what he was doing. Coincidentally, it was during the World Cup, and he replied that he was out watching the game and would chat later, which ended the reconnection attempt. I then spent a long time helping her process her emotions. 5. In situations where an anxious type tries to repair a relationship with an avoidant type, the overall trend is that reconciliation is difficult. While there are cases of successful repair, they are rare. Therefore, from the start of the repair process, I guided Ms. A to register on a social app and helped her update her profile to attract quality men. Later, Ms. A met a department manager from a real estate development company, two years her senior, who was tall, handsome, and liked her. His education matched hers, and they shared similar interests, leading to a strong connection. With mutual attractiveness, economic stability, and emotional depth, they ultimately got together successfully, concluding this case."], "experience_and_reflection": "In reflecting on the case of Ms. A, several key insights emerge that deepen our understanding of the complex dynamics at play in relationship repairs, particularly involving individuals with contrasting attachment styles. The consultation with Ms. A provided a rich tapestry of psychological dynamics, challenges, and ultimately, resolutions that can offer valuable lessons for both clients and practitioners alike.\n\nFirstly, Ms. A’s case exemplifies the intricate interplay between attachment styles, personal history, and relationship dynamics. Ms. A, with her anxious attachment style, often found herself in a cycle of needing reassurance and validation from her partner, Mr. D, who displayed a more avoidant attachment style. This dynamic is not uncommon, as individuals with anxious attachment often gravitate towards those with avoidant tendencies, creating a push-pull dynamic. This was evident in Ms. A's need for Mr. D to come to her with comfort and apologies, while he, in turn, withdrew, leading to a breakdown in communication and connection. Understanding this dynamic is crucial, as it highlights the importance of recognizing and addressing underlying attachment styles in therapy, enabling individuals to develop healthier relational patterns.\n\nA significant insight from this case is the role of cognitive dissonance in Ms. A’s perception of her relationship. Despite her high level of education and intellectual understanding of right and wrong, Ms. A struggled to reconcile her idealized view of relationships with the reality of her interactions with Mr. D. This cognitive dissonance often manifested in her reluctance to apologize and her insistence on moral and logical reasoning over emotional connection. It underscores the need for therapeutic interventions that bridge the gap between cognitive understanding and emotional experience, allowing clients to embrace vulnerability and authenticity in their relationships.\n\nThe therapeutic approach of utilizing social media as a tool for self-expression and emotional processing proved to be a novel yet effective strategy in Ms. A's case. By guiding her to curate posts that reflected her personal growth and interests, the therapeutic process enabled Ms. A to rediscover her identity outside the confines of her past relationship. This strategy not only served as a means of rebuilding attraction but also empowered Ms. A to connect with her own desires and aspirations, fostering a sense of self-worth and independence. It highlights the potential of integrating modern technology and social platforms into therapeutic practice, providing clients with creative outlets for self-exploration and emotional healing.\n\nIn facilitating the reconnection attempt with Mr. D, the case highlights the delicate balance required in guiding clients through emotionally charged interactions. The decision to limit Ms. A’s initial contact to a simple message was pivotal in managing her anxiety and setting realistic expectations. This cautious approach allowed Ms. A to confront her fears of rejection while maintaining a sense of agency and control over her emotional responses. Although the reconnection did not yield the desired outcome, it served as a valuable learning experience, reinforcing the importance of gradual exposure and emotional regulation in therapeutic settings.\n\nThe ultimate resolution of Ms. A finding a new, more compatible partner underscores the concept of “successful repairs” in relationship therapy. While the initial goal may have been to repair the relationship with Mr. D, the process led Ms. A to discover a new partner who matched her educational background, interests, and emotional needs. This outcome challenges the notion of relationship repair as a linear process, instead framing it as a journey towards personal growth and fulfillment, whether through reconciliation or the formation of new connections. It emphasizes the importance of flexibility and openness in therapeutic goals, recognizing that the path to happiness may take unexpected yet rewarding turns.\n\nFurthermore, the case illustrates the role of socioeconomic and cultural factors in relationship dynamics. Ms. A and Mr. D's differences in education and lifestyle preferences were significant contributors to their relationship challenges. Addressing these factors in therapy requires a nuanced understanding of how societal norms and personal values intersect with individual experiences. Practitioners must be attuned to these influences, fostering a therapeutic environment that respects and integrates diverse cultural perspectives.\n\nThe emotional journey of Ms. A also sheds light on the transformative power of self-awareness and introspection. Through therapy, Ms. A gained insights into her patterns of behavior and their impact on her relationships. This self-awareness was pivotal in shifting her perspective from blame to understanding, allowing her to cultivate empathy and compassion for both herself and her partners. It highlights the value of fostering self-reflection in clients, empowering them to make conscious choices that align with their values and desires.\n\nIn conclusion, the case of Ms. A provides a comprehensive exploration of the complexities inherent in relationship therapy, particularly when navigating the intricacies of attachment styles, cognitive dissonance, and cultural influences. The insights gained from this case underscore the importance of a holistic, flexible approach in therapy, one that embraces modern tools, cultural sensitivity, and a deep understanding of individual dynamics. By facilitating personal growth and emotional resilience, therapy can guide individuals towards fulfilling and meaningful relationships, whether through repairing existing bonds or forging new connections. The ultimate success in Ms. A’s case lies not only in the resolution of her relationship struggles but in her journey towards self-discovery and empowerment, illustrating the profound impact of therapeutic intervention in enhancing quality of life and relational well-being.", "causes": "Differences between anxious and avoidant personalities in relationships lead to breakups.", "symptoms": "Insecurity in the relationship, inability to tolerate differences with the partner, and eventual deterioration of the relationship leading to a breakup.", "treatment_process": "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: Through the detached reconciliation method, the visitor was allowed to post on social media for two weeks, which enhanced the visitor's ability to connect with her own desires and ambitions, and developed her sense of self-worth and independence.

Just when she is about to achieve performance results, she receives news that she is about to be fired by the director. Meanwhile, her close manager does not step in to support her at this critical moment, leaving her feeling anxious, confused, and helpless. The duration of her condition is only a few days, and her emotional reactions have not generalized; her social functioning is intact, so she is diagnosed with a general psychological issue. After discussion with the counselor, it is decided to use Rational Emotive Therapy based on her personality traits and the nature of her problems. After four counseling sessions, the seeker shows significant emotional improvement, interpersonal conflicts are resolved, and an agreement is reached with the director regarding the \"termination incident.\""], "consultation_process": ["1. General Information  \n(1) Demographic Information: Xiaoxue, female, Han nationality, 23 years old, unmarried, saleswoman at a foreign trade company in Nantong. Height and build are normal, with no significant physical illnesses. Both parents are farmers.  \n(2) Personal Growth History: The only daughter in the family, Xiaoxue grew up under the love of her parents, neighbors, and relatives. Although the family lives in a rural area, they are not financially strained, and her parents have tried to meet Xiaoxue's demands. From elementary school to university and then to work, Xiaoxue has had a smooth journey, without experiencing significant setbacks. Before graduating from university in 2017, she interned as a clerk at a foreign company for 10 months, and joined her current organization three months ago.  \n(3) Mental State: Slightly depressed mood, clear logical thinking, with cognitive biases present. Sensory perception is good, no hallucinations or delusions, complete self-awareness, and emotional expression is coherent. Very cooperative during conversations.  \n(4) Physical Condition: No significant medical history, but has been experiencing poor sleep quality recently, characterized by difficulty falling asleep, frequent dreams, and easy awakening.  \n(5) Social Functioning: No impact on social functioning.  \n\n2. Chief Complaint and Personal Statement  \nXiaoxue's distress originates from an incident that occurred at work a few days ago. She joined the company as an intern three months ago and, after working hard, secured a client at the beginning of this month. However, she received news that if she does not achieve results this month, she will be dismissed by the business director. Anxiously, Xiaoxue called the client to confirm the contract signing time, only to learn it would be at the earliest next month. Hearing this news, she sought help from the department manager, whom she considered a good friend, but the manager chose to remain silent this time. The blow from work and feelings of helplessness left Xiaoxue feeling desperate. Her resentment towards the director, disappointment and suspicion towards the manager, powerlessness about her current situation, and confusion about the future led her into a state of anxiety, anger, and depression, resulting in insomnia and significant psychological pressure. According to Xiaoxue, she has no friends in Nantong, and with this situation occurring, she didn't know who to confide in, prompting her to seek help from the psychological studio.  \n\n3. Observations from the Counselor  \nDuring the initial consultation, Xiaoxue appeared somewhat fatigued, with dark circles under her eyes, suggesting she had not rested well. She was neatly and cleanly dressed, took the initiative to greet the counselor, and was very polite. When mentioning the director, her expression was filled with anger and disdain; when discussing the manager, she showed disappointment, confusion, and helplessness. Her narrative was clear, logically consistent, and she exhibited a strong willingness to seek help.  \n\n4. Assessment and Diagnosis  \n(1) Preliminary diagnosis: General psychological issues.  \n(2) Diagnostic Basis:  \n1. Internal conflict caused by interpersonal relationships at work due to real-life events, resulting in negative emotions (anxiety, confusion, helplessness).  \n2. The duration of negative emotions has been short, lasting only a few days.  \n3. The emotional reactions remain under rational control, and she has maintained normal behavior, essentially sustaining her usual learning, living, and working.  \n4. The triggering factors for the negative emotions are limited to the initial event, and the emotional reactions have not generalized.  \n(3) Differential Diagnosis:  \n1. According to the three principles for distinguishing between normal and abnormal psychology: the seeker has unified awareness, consistency between subjective and objective perspectives, stable personality, self-awareness of psychological issues, and proactive behavior in seeking medical help. There are no psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or delusions, ruling out psychotic disorders.  \n2. Since the seeker's conflicts are connected to her real situation, involving recognized significant life events with a clear moral nature, this falls under normal conflicts, thus ruling out neuroses and neurotic psychological issues.  \n3. The seeker has anxiety and depression, but these are merely accompanying symptoms, thus ruling out anxiety disorders and depressive neuroses.  \n4. Given the short duration of the seeker's issues, the absence of generalization, and no severe disruption to social functioning, serious psychological issues can be ruled out.  \n(4) Analysis of the Causes of the Seekers' Issues:  \n1. Biological Factors: Not significant.  \n2. Social Factors:  \n(1) Simple social relationships; having no friends in Nantong leads to feelings of loneliness and helplessness when encountering setbacks or difficulties, lacking a good social support system.  \n(2) Recently graduated from university with limited social experience, she does not know how to cope with issues, lacking effective problem-solving methods.  \n3. Psychological Factors:  \n(1) As the only child, Xiaoxue grew up under her parents' care and cannot accept others' disregard for her.  \n(2) Her growth process has been relatively smooth, with little suffering and setbacks, resulting in poor psychological endurance.  \n(3) She is quiet and introverted, with poor interpersonal skills and lacks effective conflict resolution strategies.  \n(4) Holds some erroneous beliefs: \"How I treat others, others should treat me in the same way,\" \"Others should consider issues from my perspective,\" \"They should understand my difficulties,\" etc.  \nBased on the above, she can be initially diagnosed with general psychological problems caused by cognitive distortions, falling within the realm of psychological counseling.  \n\n5. Establishment of Counseling Goals  \nBased on the above assessment and diagnosis, the following counseling goals were determined in consultation with the seeker.  \n(1) Specific and Short-term Goals:  \n1. Alleviate emotions such as anger, anxiety, and irritability, gradually reducing the seeker's psychological pressure.  \n2. Adjust cognitive patterns and change perceptions of the director and manager.  \n(2) Final and Long-term Goals:  \n1. Help the seeker adjust her self-perception, properly handle others' negative behaviors, and find meaning and value in these experiences.  \n2. Establish a positive and healthy mechanism for resolving conflicts and learn healthy and effective interpersonal skills.  \n3. Assist the seeker in improving her personality and building a sound character.  \n\n6. Methods and Principles Used  \n(1) Selected Method and Principle: Rational Emotive Therapy (RET) is chosen. Its basic principle is: through pure rational analysis and logical reasoning, change the seeker's irrational beliefs to help her resolve emotional and behavioral issues. This theory posits that it is not the events themselves that cause people distress and pain, but rather the incorrect interpretations and evaluations of those events. Therefore, only by rational analysis and logical reasoning can we change the unreasonable beliefs causing the seeker's emotional distress, establish rational and correct beliefs, help the seeker overcome her emotional issues, create a meaningful life, and thereby maintain psychological health and promote comprehensive personality development.  \n(2) Specific Responsibilities, Rights, and Obligations of Both Parties:  \nSeekers' Responsibilities, Rights, and Obligations:  \nResponsibilities:  \n(1) Provide the counselor with truthful information related to psychological issues;  \n(2) Actively collaborate with the counselor to explore problem-solving methods;  \n(3) Complete mutually agreed-upon tasks.  \nRights:  \n(1) Right to know the counselor's training background and professional qualifications;  \n(2) Right to understand specific counseling methods, processes, and principles;  \n(3) Right to choose or change a suitable counselor;  \n(4) Right to request referral or terminate counseling;  \n(5) Right to be informed, negotiate, and choose the content of the counseling plan.  \nObligations:  \n(1) Abide by the relevant regulations of the counseling institution;  \n(2) Comply with and execute the agreed-upon aspects of the counseling plan;  \n(3) Respect the counselor and adhere to appointment times, notifying the counselor in advance of any special circumstances.  \nCounselor's Responsibilities, Rights, and Obligations:  \nResponsibilities:  \n(1) Abide by professional ethics and relevant national laws and regulations;  \n(2) Help the seeker resolve psychological issues;  \n(3) Strictly adhere to confidentiality principles and clarify confidentiality exceptions.  \nRights:  \n(1) Right to access personal information related to the seeker's psychological issues;  \n(2) Right to choose suitable seekers;  \n(3) With a responsible attitude towards the seeker, right to propose referral or terminate counseling.  \nObligations:  \n(1) Introduce the counselor's training background and present relevant credentials such as business licenses and professional qualifications;  \n(2) Abide by the relevant regulations of the counseling institution;  \n(3) Comply with and execute the agreed-upon aspects of the counseling plan;  \n(4) Respect the seeker and adhere to appointment times, notifying the seeker in advance of any special circumstances.  \n(3) Counseling and Fees: Two sessions per week, each lasting 50 minutes, at 200 yuan per session. A total of 4 sessions.  \n\n7. Counseling Process  \nThe counseling is roughly divided into the following stages: diagnostic assessment and establishment of the counseling relationship; implementation of rational emotive therapy; concluding and consolidating stage.  \nSpecific Counseling Process:  \n(1) First Counseling: The purpose of this session is to understand Xiaoxue's basic situation, identify the main issues, conduct counseling analysis, and establish a good counseling relationship. The counseling process mainly includes:  \n1. Completing the counseling registration form, introducing related matters and rules of counseling.  \n2. Talking with Xiaoxue to understand her relevant information, exploring the reasons for her psychological conflicts, and making preliminary problem analysis.  \n3. Jointly formulating counseling goals.  \n4. Assigning homework: seriously think about the content of the discussion and attempt to analyze the causes independently.  \n(2) Second Counseling: The purpose of this session is to analyze the deeper reasons behind emotions such as anxiety, introduce Xiaoxue to rational emotive therapy, and identify irrational beliefs (B). The process mainly includes: introducing rational emotive therapy to the seeker and providing examples. For instance, if you lose your phone, you may feel down for a month, constantly blaming and regretting yourself. Alternatively, you might learn from this experience and improve your awareness of keeping your belongings safe. In this case, losing the phone is the triggering event (A), feeling down and enhancing your awareness is the emotional reaction and behavioral outcome (C), while the real influencing factor (B) is your two completely different perspectives. Xiaoxue was captivated by this vivid example and showed strong interest. In the subsequent process, the counselor and Xiaoxue first identified the triggering event (A): the director is going to dismiss her, and the manager did not help her. Her anxiety and other emotions during these days are (C), so what irrational beliefs (B) does the seeker hold? With the counselor's guidance, Xiaoxue identified the following irrational beliefs: (1) The leader should not criticize me in front of everyone; it should not make me embarrassed; (2) The leader saying that if I do not produce results this month, I will not be hired is because he wants to fire me; (3) The leader should treat employees equally and friendly, without creating too much distance; (4) As a friend, the manager should stand by me during difficulties, not take advantage of my misfortune. This session concluded with Xiaoxue feeling much lighter and even excited about discovering the new concept of \"rational emotive therapy,\" stating she would take time to reflect on the discussion's content. The counselor assigned homework: Xiaoxue should further specify the irrational beliefs based on this analysis and attempt to identify five strengths of the director.  \n(3) Third Counseling: The purpose of this session is mainly to guide Xiaoxue to debate her irrational beliefs (D) and replace them with new views (E). The specific process is as follows: Xiaoxue proactively communicated her homework from the last session, identifying the director's five strengths as follows: (1) He leads the team well, and their performance is better than other teams; (2) He rose from security guard to director, showing he must have put in a lot of effort; (3) He treats the company like his home and is very loyal; (4) He is meticulous and responsible in his work; (5) He can oversee the big picture and handle crises. The counselor affirmed Xiaoxue's positive changes and cooperative attitude. Next, they engaged in a debate over irrational beliefs, identifying new views to replace them. Regarding irrational belief one: The leader should not criticize me in front of everyone; it should not make me embarrassed. The counselor guided Xiaoxue to provide actual examples of the leader criticizing her, using a \"midwife-style debate\" to challenge the irrational belief. Xiaoxue could not find a valid reason for \"leaders should not criticize employees publicly.\" She realized her emotions stemmed from irrational views and recognized her own laziness and lack of discipline at work, deciding to improve her work quality.  \nRegarding irrational belief two: The leader's statement that if I do not produce results this month, I will not be hired is intentional dismissal. The following is part of the dialogue between the counselor and the seeker:  \nCounselor: You say the leader intends to fire you?  \nSeeker: Yes, I feel he has an opinion about me (after previous guidance, Xiaoxue's dislike for the leader has significantly decreased).  \nCounselor: Can you find evidence for that?  \nSeeker: (silence) I don’t know…  \nCounselor: Are there any relevant company regulations regarding probation?  \nSeeker: I remember when we first joined the company, the leader mentioned something about it. It seems there's a clause in the probation agreement.  \nCounselor: Okay, if you were the boss of a company, how would you handle such a situation?… (silence) (The counselor is also silent)  \nSeeker: But even if it’s the company’s rule, he should discuss it with me!  \nCounselor: Why should he approach you instead of you proactively seeking him out?  \nThrough the counselor's guidance, Xiaoxue realized that the leader's actions are also part of the company's personnel management principles and are not directed specifically at her. Moreover, her situation is special, and \"human feelings exist beyond legal principles,\" so regardless of the outcome, a thorough communication is necessary.  \nRegarding irrational belief three: The leader should interact with employees equally and friendly, without creating too much distance. The first two irrational beliefs were resolved well. However, the seeker showed clear resistance on this issue. Xiaoxue insisted, \"No matter who it is, why can't they be a little kinder? Why do they have to act sternly? Wouldn’t it be better if everyone got along harmoniously?\" At this point, the counselor introduced the Golden Rule: In interpersonal relationships, there is a \"Golden Rule\": treat others as you wish to be treated. We can never demand how others should treat us, just like you can’t expect an empty valley to say, \"I like you\"; it will only echo your words back to you. Therefore, if you want others to treat you well, start by treating others that way. While we may encounter some harm, trust that it’s an exception, and we cannot dictate others' words and actions. As long as you adhere to this principle, you will undoubtedly cultivate excellent interpersonal relationships. The seeker recalled many instances in her interactions that did not align with the \"Golden Rule,\" realizing that her coldness and prejudice towards the director had led to estrangement and misunderstanding between them.  \nRegarding irrational belief four: As a friend, the manager should stand by me during difficulties and not take advantage of my misfortune. The counselor first differentiated between colleagues and friends for Xiaoxue and guided her to think about other motivations behind the manager's response. After careful analysis, Xiaoxue felt the manager might have the following intentions: (1) I have been on probation for three months, and she might worry about my financial situation (probation pay is very low), so switching jobs might be a more realistic choice; (2) I have not produced results in three months, so perhaps I am not suited for this job, and changing environments might benefit my career development; (3) I graduated from university but am working with some diploma and even high school graduates, yet my performance is far inferior to theirs; she might worry about my mental imbalance; (4) Perhaps she feels she made too many decisions for me before, and now she wants me to take charge of my matters; (5) Maybe she is also caught in a conflict, unsure how to handle it… Through this analysis, Xiaoxue uncovered more possibilities, indicating that her previous views were mere guesses without confirmation. Xiaoxue decided to communicate with the manager as soon as possible to clarify her doubts.  \nHomework: Attempt to identify other irrational beliefs in life and debate to replace them with rational beliefs.  \n(4) Fourth Counseling: This final counseling session aimed to provide feedback on recent situations, reinforce Xiaoxue's positive thoughts and behaviors, jointly establish directions for future growth, and summarize the counseling results. The seeker walked into the counseling room excitedly, bringing two good news: First, after the last counseling, she proactively sought an in-depth conversation with the director, candidly acknowledging her previous wrongdoings and thanking the director for pointing out the issues in her work directly. To her surprise, the director was very kind and talkative, sharing many important things she should pay attention to at work, resolving their \"grievance.\" Moreover, the director informed her that if she can secure this order next month, the company will sign a two-year labor contract with her. Second, through communication with the manager, she understood the manager's difficulties and recognized areas where she still needed to improve her work quality: mixing colleagues with friends, and having a childish temperament, among others. The seeker smiled, saying, \"I really decided to change many bad habits!\" The counselor was pleased for her and together they analyzed other irrational beliefs present in life, such as male colleagues should behave gentlemanly and female colleagues should be composed and quiet, etc. Notably, in this session, the seeker took the initiative throughout the entire process, engaging in positive communication, which is an encouraging sign. From the seeker's fluent speech and bright smile, it was evident that sunshine had entered her heart. I believe that after this growth, the seeker will face the troubles and challenges in her work and life more positively and courageously. Finally, the counselor recommended the seeker read two books: \"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People,\" focusing on the habits of \"Understanding Yourself and Others\" and \"Synergizing,\" and \"Reconstructing the Mind,\" with an emphasis on the chapters \"Emotions\" and \"Creating a Successful and Happy Life.\"  \n\n8. Evaluation of Counseling Effects  \n(1) Seeker's Self-Evaluation: The seeker's emotions of anxiety, anger, and helplessness have alleviated; she has become more positive and sunny in life; she can better handle interpersonal relationships and conflicts at work; and the interpersonal conflicts with the director and manager have been satisfactorily resolved.  \n(2) Counselor's Evaluation: The seeker's mental state has significantly improved, and her psychological pressure has been alleviated. Follow-up visits and tracking one month later revealed that the seeker has become cheerful and proactive, with improved work efficiency (receiving the company's \"Fastest Growing Award\"). This counseling was relatively complete and orderly, effectively achieving the expected goals."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on the application of Rational Emotive Therapy (RET) in Xiaoxue's case has provided invaluable insights into the nuances of cognitive therapy, particularly within the context of workplace dynamics and interpersonal conflicts. Xiaoxue's experience exemplifies how negative thoughts and cognitive distortions can significantly impact an individual's emotional state and behavior, especially when faced with stressful situations. It is essential to understand that while RET offers a structured framework for addressing irrational beliefs, the effectiveness of therapy largely depends on the counselor's ability to apply these principles with precision and empathy.\n\nXiaoxue's case highlights the critical role of cognitive distortions in exacerbating emotional distress. Her irrational beliefs, such as expecting equal and friendly treatment from all colleagues or assuming that a friend's silence signifies betrayal, are common cognitive pitfalls that many individuals encounter. These beliefs often stem from deeply ingrained expectations and societal norms, which can lead to unrealistic demands on interpersonal relationships. Through RET, we aimed to dismantle these beliefs by encouraging Xiaoxue to adopt a more rational and balanced perspective. This process involved not just identifying irrational beliefs but actively debating and replacing them with rational alternatives.\n\nThe counselor's role in facilitating this transformation cannot be overstated. As clinicians, we are tasked with guiding clients through a journey of self-discovery, where they learn to challenge their preconceived notions and adopt healthier cognitive patterns. In Xiaoxue's case, the \"midwifery\" technique was particularly effective. This approach involves the counselor actively engaging with the client, asking probing questions, and gently challenging their assumptions. The aim is not to impose new beliefs but to help the client arrive at them independently through logical reasoning and self-reflection. This method fosters a sense of empowerment and ownership over the therapeutic process, which is crucial for long-term cognitive restructuring.\n\nThe importance of social support and relationships in managing psychological distress was another key takeaway from this case. Xiaoxue's feelings of loneliness and helplessness in a new city were compounded by her lack of a social network. Social isolation can exacerbate feelings of anxiety and depression, as individuals often lack a sounding board for their thoughts and emotions. In Xiaoxue's case, the absence of friends to confide in meant that she internalized her stress and relied heavily on her own interpretations, which were often skewed by her cognitive distortions. This underscores the need for counselors to address social factors in therapy and encourage clients to build supportive networks that can offer emotional validation and practical advice.\n\nMoreover, Xiaoxue's background as an only child, who was accustomed to receiving unconditional support and attention, played a significant role in her inability to cope with perceived disregard from colleagues. Her upbringing in a nurturing environment may have contributed to her expectation of similar treatment in all social interactions. This is a common pattern observed in individuals transitioning from family-centric support systems to more competitive and less personal environments like the workplace. RET was instrumental in helping Xiaoxue recalibrate her expectations and develop a more resilient approach to interpersonal conflicts.\n\nThe counseling sessions provided Xiaoxue with the tools to reassess her beliefs and attitudes, ultimately leading to significant emotional improvement and resolution of workplace conflicts. However, it is important to recognize that cognitive therapy is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Each client brings a unique set of challenges and predispositions that require tailored interventions. In Xiaoxue's case, her introverted nature and lack of interpersonal skills necessitated a focus on building confidence and assertiveness. Future interventions could include role-playing scenarios and communication skills training to further enhance her ability to navigate complex social interactions.\n\nXiaoxue's successful negotiation with the director and her improved relationship with the manager are testament to the transformative power of cognitive restructuring. By actively engaging in dialogue and understanding the perspectives of others, she was able to alleviate misunderstandings and foster a more collaborative work environment. This outcome highlights the importance of communication in resolving conflicts and the need for clients to take an active role in their personal and professional relationships.\n\nLooking ahead, Xiaoxue's journey offers several avenues for further exploration and application. As she continues to develop her interpersonal skills, it may be beneficial to explore additional therapeutic modalities, such as mindfulness-based stress reduction, which can complement cognitive therapy by enhancing emotional regulation and resilience. Integrating these practices into her daily routine could provide Xiaoxue with a more holistic approach to managing stress and maintaining psychological well-being.\n\nReflecting on the broader implications of this case, it is evident that workplace dynamics and interpersonal relationships are significant sources of stress for many individuals. As clinicians, we must remain vigilant in identifying and addressing these factors in therapy. Encouraging clients to view setbacks as opportunities for growth and learning can foster a more positive outlook and reduce the likelihood of emotional turmoil. Furthermore, promoting the development of healthy coping mechanisms and conflict resolution strategies is essential for long-term psychological health.\n\nIn conclusion, Xiaoxue's case underscores the critical role of RET in addressing cognitive distortions and its effectiveness in resolving interpersonal conflicts. The insights gained from this case have reinforced the importance of personalized therapy that considers the individual's unique background, social context, and psychological predispositions. As counselors, our ability to adapt therapeutic techniques to meet these needs is paramount in achieving successful outcomes. Xiaoxue's progress is a reminder of the profound impact that skilled counseling can have on an individual's life, enabling them to face future challenges with greater confidence and resilience.", "causes": "A newcomer to the workplace who is in conflict with his/her leader due to dismissal, lack of social support and weak stress resistance, leading to depression.", "symptoms": "Anxiety, depression, insomnia.", "treatment_process": "Rational-emotional therapy: By allowing visitors to identify and challenge their irrational beliefs, they can re-examine their relationship with their leaders, get rid of their negative emotions, and re-communicate in an appropriate way to resolve workplace conflicts.", "characteristics_of_illness": "The visitor is new to the workplace, has little social experience, finds it difficult to accept others' neglect of him/herself, and is confused about the boundaries between coworkers and friends.", "treatment_effect": "Through rational-emotional therapy, we helped the visitor to change her irrational cognition, establish a positive and healthy conflict resolution mechanism, learn healthy and effective social skills, expand her social support network, and improve her psychological resilience."}
{"id": 124, "case_description": ["Xiao Jian is a handsome young man, 24 years old, currently pursuing a master's degree at a key university. He is a very capable boy, giving off a cheerful and generous vibe, and is well-liked by his classmates, including some boys. Although Xiao Jian has great personal qualities and many girls pursue him, he has always struggled to feel a genuine liking, even for those girls who are praised by boys as \"goddesses.\" He finds them excellent but can only appreciate them rather than develop feelings. Interestingly, there are occasionally boys around him who make Xiao Jian feel moved, enjoying the feeling of being with them, which brings him both happiness and fear. Coming from a conservative family, his parents hope he will graduate, find a job, and then get married and have children. Xiao Jian once longed to have his own family, but his current situation leaves him confused; he doesn't understand why he cannot connect with women and instead wishes to be with men. Therefore, he hopes to gain clarity through counseling, wishing to lead a normal life in the future."], "consultation_process": ["Because it was a consultation about \"sex,\" Xiao Jian was reluctant to come to the consultation room for an in-person meeting to protect his privacy. Considering the effectiveness of the consultation, I communicated with Xiao Jian to address his concerns, and in the end, he decided to come for the meeting. He arrived at the consultation room on time at the scheduled time, and it was evident that he was a handsome and charming young man, with polite manners and appropriate speech, consistent with the impression I had from our phone conversation.", "After a brief communication, the formal consultation began. However, when it came to the topics he wanted to discuss, Xiao Jian hesitated. He was either worried about being judged by the counselor or had not dispelled his inner concerns. So, I tried to encourage Xiao Jian, alleviating his doubts and establishing initial trust. Thus, Xiao Jian began the consultation.", "Xiao Jian: Teacher, do you think that homosexuals are all sick?", "Counselor: Well, I personally don't think that homosexuality is an illness. Everyone has the right to pursue love, and both those who are attracted to the same sex and those who are attracted to the opposite sex should be respected. Are you saying this because the issue of \"homosexuality\" has caused you confusion?", "Xiao Jian: I don't know. I feel like I'm not gay, but I don't like girls. I always reject the girls who pursue me, and I don't know why. I don't know what to do. Right now, I feel a lot of pressure in my heart. I look down on myself and feel disgusted with myself. I don't know how to face my family. I feel very painful and very repressed. As Xiao Jian spoke, his eyes started to redden, then he stared out the window, somewhat lost, remaining silent.", "In order to help Xiao Jian relax, lower his internal defenses, and establish a trusting counseling relationship, I suggested that he create a house-tree-person drawing. Xiao Jian agreed with my idea, and after explaining the drawing requirements to him, he began to draw on the paper.", "Xiao Jian spread out the paper and first drew a big house in the center, which took up almost one-third of the paper. The house had a door that was not very wide but not too tall either, and two windows that were almost the same size as the door. There were four steps leading up to the door, and in front of the steps was a stone path. On one side of the house, Xiao Jian drew a tree with a fairly thick trunk but not many branches and leaves, resembling a tree in spring. Finally, Xiao Jian started on the character; he drew a handsome boy with thick eyebrows and big eyes, and a cool hairstyle. After finishing, Xiao Jian specifically retouched the area from the ear to the chin.", "After seeing Xiao Jian's paintings, it is evident that he is a boy who needs a sense of security and strives for perfection, but lacks inner strength. I simply shared my observations with Xiao Jian, and he agreed with my perspective, so we began our communication through painting.", "Counselor: From your painting, I see a quiet world that makes me feel there is some coldness and loneliness in your heart, right?", "Xiao Jian: Yes, I enjoy the world of being alone.", "Counselor: You hope to be a cheerful boy, but from the drawing, it feels like your inner self lacks strength, right?", "Xiao Jian: Yes, I always feel that my abilities are not enough.", "Counselor: You are a boy who seeks perfection, aren't you?", "Xiao Jian: Yes, I wish I were the perfect man!", "Counselor: You hope to appear cheerful, but you have suppressed many worries inside?", "Xiao Jian: Yes, there are some things I don't know how to say, and I don't know to whom I can say them!", "Counselor: You hope to have a friend like that, but you have high expectations for a good friend, right?", "Xiao Jian: Yes, I have many friends, but I don't have many true good friends!", "Counselor: The house you drew is very big, why is that?", "Xiao Jian: Yes, I hope to have a big house, as it would make me feel secure.", "Counselor: But a big house can feel empty, especially when there are few people around. Besides, having a home doesn't necessarily mean having love or safety. What do you think?", "Xiao Jian: Yes, I felt that way while drawing, but I still want it to be bigger.", "Counselor: Is it like your home when you were a child?", "Xiao Jian: Yes, my childhood home was like this, very cold, without love or warmth.", "Counselor: Why is that?", "Xiao Jian: It's all because of my mom. (At this point, Xiao Jian's eyes turned red again.)", "Counselor: Mom's actions have made the home lose its warmth, haven't they?", "Xiao Jian: Yes, Mom is very domineering and has a very volatile temper. When something happens, she doesn't listen to explanations or ask for reasons; she just starts yelling and cursing. She thinks Dad is useless and often berates him mercilessly. Over time, Dad prefers to stay outside and doesn't want to come home. So she takes her anger out on my sister and me, often resorting to physical punishment and frequently scolding us for not studying well, being inconsiderate, and being stupid and clumsy. I feel like I grew up in fear every day. I don't want to go home or see her; seeing her feels like encountering a madwoman.", "When Xiao Jian finished speaking, he took a deep breath, and I could sense the repression in his heart. Then, Xiao Jian began to talk about his own matters, which gave me a deeper understanding of him.", "Xiao Jian did not feel much maternal love during his growth process. His father was relatively weak and not often at home, so Xiao Jian rarely spent time with him; in his mind, his father seemed more like a code name. His mother was quite strong, and since other children were unwilling to play with Xiao Jian, he could only be with his sister. Because he looked delicate and spoke softly, his peers nicknamed him \"fake girl.\" Especially when he went out with his sister, those little girls would disdain him, which caused him a lot of hurt. As a result, Xiao Jian began to feel lonely and often spent time alone, a situation that continued until high school. In high school, Xiao Jian's grades were excellent, and both teachers and classmates cared about him, plus several outstanding girls liked him, but Xiao Jian felt nothing. It was his deskmate, a sunny, handsome, and outgoing boy, who brought him a lot of joy. Especially one time when Xiao Jian was injured, this boy gave him a comforting hug, making Xiao Jian feel very secure and grounded. Later, they separated for college, and that boy got his own girlfriend. However, Xiao Jian fondly remembered the companionship of that high school boy. After entering university, Xiao Jian rejected several girls' advances, particularly in his junior year when he turned down a very exceptional girl's pursuit because he didn't know how to make himself like her. At that time, Xiao Jian coincidentally met another male classmate who was charming and carefree; they admired each other, and their relationship grew closer, eventually leading to other interactions beyond just a sexual relationship. During that time, Xiao Jian felt quite fulfilled and happy. After graduating from university, for various reasons, the boy chose to return to the city where his parents lived, while Xiao Jian decided to pursue a master's degree. Their relationship remained good, but neither took a step further. Xiao Jian also knew that this boy had had a girlfriend before and that they had been intimate. Xiao Jian often wondered what exactly his relationship with this boy was, but he couldn't figure it out and didn't want to come to a conclusion. He was afraid that he might be gay.", "So I had a simple intention dialogue with Xiao Jian, and from his intentions, I saw his inner fear of his mother. He felt more relaxed when he started interacting with girls, but when the girl got closer to him, he became anxious. He feared that the girl might become like his mother. It's not that he doesn't like girls; rather, he doesn't know how to like them. He is afraid that his future will be as miserable as his father's. In Xiao Jian's intentions, the image of his mother has replaced that of a woman, while his father's image represents his future—weak and powerless.", "Finally, an analysis was conducted with Xiao Jian, helping him to understand the thoughts in his subconscious and to realize why he deeply desires a sense of security. It also made him aware that the influence of his mother during his upbringing led him to suppress his true feelings towards girls. Xiao Jian understood why he hopes to be with boys. Now he needs to accept his past, embrace his strong and fierce mother as well as his weak and powerless father, and understand his current self. He needs to gradually mature internally and gain the strength to face his emotions.", "After four counseling sessions, Xiao Jian feels that his emotions and thoughts have improved significantly. He even took the initiative to send a message of greeting to the girl he used to like. Seeing his change, I am happy for him as his counselor."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on Xiao Jian's case has afforded me a profound understanding of the intricate ways in which early familial dynamics can shape an individual's psychological and emotional landscape, particularly concerning issues of identity and self-acceptance. This experience underscores the importance of exploring the roots of one's fears and desires, as they are often intertwined with the subconscious imprints left by significant relationships during formative years.\n\nXiao Jian's struggle with his sexual identity is not merely a question of orientation but rather a complex narrative woven from his childhood experiences and emotional associations. Growing up in a household dominated by a volatile and controlling maternal figure, Xiao Jian developed an internal narrative where love and relationships were synonymous with fear and oppression. His mother's unpredictable temper and harsh demeanor created a home environment that was cold and devoid of nurturing warmth. This absence of maternal affection and the presence of a submissive father figure contributed to a skewed perception of gender roles and relationships in Xiao Jian's subconscious mind.\n\nThe house-tree-person drawing exercise revealed much about Xiao Jian's inner world, highlighting his need for security and his pursuit of perfection. The large, somewhat empty house he depicted can be interpreted as a metaphor for his desire for a safe, structured space that he never experienced as a child. However, the emptiness also reflects his emotional solitude and the void left by the lack of genuine connections in his life. The thick tree trunk with sparse branches and leaves symbolizes his external resilience juxtaposed against an inner fragility, indicating that while he may appear robust, he feels unsupported and vulnerable internally.\n\nEngaging with Xiao Jian through art facilitated a non-verbal exploration of these deep-seated issues, allowing him to project his feelings and fears without the immediate pressure of verbal articulation. This method proved invaluable in bypassing his initial reluctance to openly discuss his fears regarding his sexual orientation. It allowed us to build rapport and trust, which are essential components in any therapeutic relationship.\n\nOne of the most significant revelations during our sessions was Xiao Jian's association of femininity with his mother's traits. His reluctance to form romantic connections with women stemmed not from a lack of attraction but from a fear of the emotional consequences of such relationships. Xiao Jian's internalized image of women, influenced heavily by his mother, was one of dominance and emotional volatility. Thus, his subconscious equated intimacy with potential emotional turmoil, leading him to subconsciously avoid forming romantic attachments with women.\n\nConversely, Xiao Jian's attraction to men can be partially understood through his interactions with his father and male peers. His father's passive presence and absence in Xiao Jian's life led to a yearning for male companionship and validation, which he found in his male friends. These relationships offered a sense of safety and emotional security that was absent in his interactions with women. The comforting embrace of his high school friend, for example, provided a stark contrast to his fraught relationship with his mother, reinforcing the association of men with emotional refuge.\n\nThe therapeutic process with Xiao Jian highlighted the necessity of addressing not only his conscious concerns but also the subconscious narratives driving his behaviors and emotions. By helping Xiao Jian acknowledge and accept his past, we worked to dismantle the psychological barriers preventing him from embracing his identity. Recognizing the influence of his mother on his perception of women allowed Xiao Jian to reframe his understanding of femininity and relationships, reducing the subconscious fear that hindered his emotional expression.\n\nIn dealing with issues of sexual orientation, it is crucial to approach the subject with a nonjudgmental stance, focusing on the individual's unique experiences and emotional realities. Homosexuality, often laden with societal stigma, can generate intense internal conflict and self-rejection in individuals like Xiao Jian, who come from conservative backgrounds. Therefore, the role of the therapist is to create a safe, accepting space where clients can explore and affirm their identity without fear of condemnation or prejudice.\n\nThe acceptance and validation provided during our sessions allowed Xiao Jian to lower his internal defenses, facilitating a more honest and open exploration of his feelings. It became evident that the true essence of the counseling process lay not in labeling or categorizing his sexual orientation but in helping Xiao Jian understand and accept his authentic self, free from the burdens of societal expectations and internalized fears.\n\nFurthermore, Xiao Jian's journey underscores the importance of cultivating resilience and self-compassion. By coming to terms with his past, Xiao Jian began to develop a sense of inner strength, which is vital for facing future challenges and embracing his true identity. Encouraging him to send a message to the girl he once liked was a significant step toward reclaiming his ability to form connections without the overshadowing influence of fear and insecurity.\n\nIn retrospect, Xiao Jian's case serves as a poignant reminder of the profound impact that early familial relationships have on an individual's identity formation and emotional well-being. It highlights the critical role of therapeutic interventions in uncovering and addressing the subconscious narratives that shape our clients' perceptions of themselves and their world. As clinicians, our task is to guide our clients toward self-discovery and acceptance, fostering an environment where they can redefine their narratives and embrace their authentic selves.\n\nThe use of creative therapeutic techniques, like the house-tree-person drawing, proves invaluable in bridging the gap between the conscious and subconscious mind, offering insights that might otherwise remain obscured. This case reinforces the belief that healing and personal growth stem from understanding and accepting one's past, allowing individuals like Xiao Jian to step forward into their futures with clarity, confidence, and a renewed sense of self.", "causes": "Impact of early developmental experiences of an irritable and emotional mother and a weak father on the client's gender orientation.", "symptoms": "Great internal conflict and self-denial due to suspicion of homosexuality.", "treatment_process": "Psychoanalytic therapy: Using the Fannie Tree test, the client projects her own emotions and fears, then explores the subconscious mind that drives her behavior and emotions, recognizes her mother's influence on her view of femininity, and re-understands her femininity and relationships, thus alleviating the subconscious fears and facilitating the expression of her emotions.", "characteristics_of_illness": "The visitor's doubts and fears about homosexuality stem from associating femininity with his mother's character traits.

His mother said, \"The child has his father's personality, and he has had a bad temper since he was young, often throwing things when he gets angry at home.\" His father said, \"The child is just pretending; there's no problem at all.

Psychological problems are related to mental illness but are not the same. Psychological problems, often referred to as psychological disorders or imbalances, are localized abnormal states within normal psychological activities without pathological changes. They are characterized by their clear episodic and temporary nature, often linked to specific emotions or situations, and are mostly conditional emotional responses. When the environmental conditions change, an individual's psychological activities can return to normal. Students may experience various psychological issues due to pressures from studying and other factors. Psychological problems are generally classified into unfavorable states, psychological disorders, and mental illnesses. Unfavorable states typically refer to emotional fluctuations that can self-resolve, while psychological disorders and mental illnesses have a significant impact on normal life and may require professional counseling, which is usually not difficult to resolve. In contrast, mental illness is a disease characterized by mental incompetence and abnormal behavior. Patients are unable to live and work normally, requiring legal guardians, and in severe cases, hospitalization is necessary.", "Third, afraid of affecting studies.", "Case: Song, female, first year of high school. Two months after starting school, Song began to feel anxious and extremely fearful. She reported seeing zombies and ghosts in the hallways and bathrooms, and sometimes the zombies would secretly crawl onto her back. After receiving a request for help, I assessed that Song's obvious symptoms of hallucinations and delusions indicated that this was beyond the scope of ordinary psychological counseling. I suggested that the parents take their child to a professional hospital for treatment. However, the parents were concerned about the impact on their child's studies and repeatedly delayed. It was only when the student's condition worsened that they were forced to go to the hospital.", "Worried about affecting their studies, students often do not seek timely treatment, even if it means missing one or two classes; they feel that even a simple psychological consultation is a waste of time. In most cases, unless a student can no longer bear it, very few students or parents prioritize addressing psychological issues. They often emphasize the importance of studying, insisting that there is no time to waste. As a result, the opposite occurs, and simple problems become complicated, mild issues turn into severe ones, causing students physical and mental suffering and leading to even greater academic losses.", "Fourth, the teacher's judgment is incorrect.", "Case: Zhao, male, senior high school student. With just over two months until the college entrance examination, Zhao said he felt uncomfortable and unable to study in the classroom, insisting on reviewing at home.

Concerned about potential accidents, they sought my help.

Unable to change his mind and fearing accidents, they could only give in to him.", "Upon meeting Zhao, Zhao appeared very dejected and helpless. He said that he feels a sense of suffocation in the classroom, gets distracted during lectures, and makes mistakes on problems, unable to concentrate on studying at all. It's not that he is being willful or reckless; he simply cannot control it.", "As major exams approach, students become tense and anxious. Under high anxiety, their thinking becomes negatively one-dimensional, attention is scattered, learning efficiency declines, and they suffer from various psychological pains and disturbances. These issues can be easily resolved using psychological techniques. However, if parents and teachers misjudge the situation and approach problems from a qualitative character perspective or attempt to solve them with traditional lecturing, it can lead to counterproductive outcomes, causing harm to both the individuals involved and the situation at hand.", "Students' psychological problems are caused by various factors such as themselves, their families, and schools. There are many ways to solve these problems, but it's better to take fewer detours and find shortcuts. As long as we treat students patiently, carefully observe the issues, thoughtfully address the problems, and trust in science and technology, we can achieve more with less effort, allowing students to learn happily and live fulfilling lives."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on my years of clinical practice with middle school students facing psychological challenges, I've come to recognize the multifaceted nature of these issues. Adolescence is a unique period marked by profound developmental changes, both physically and emotionally, which can lead to a variety of psychological stressors. As practitioners, educators, and parents, it's crucial to approach these challenges with empathy, patience, and a robust understanding of the underlying causes and manifestations of such psychological disturbances.\n\nOne of the most significant insights from my experiences is the importance of acknowledging the developmental conflict that middle school students face. This period is characterized by a rapid physical growth spurt while cognitive and emotional maturity develop at a slower pace. This imbalance often results in an increased sense of independence coupled with a lack of self-control. Students are eager to assert their individuality, yet they may struggle with emotional regulation and decision-making. This developmental stage can manifest in psychological problems like adjustment disorders, inefficient learning habits, interpersonal tensions, and exam-related anxieties.\n\nA critical factor in addressing these issues is recognizing the common misconceptions that surround mental health problems in adolescents. One such misconception is the belief that psychological issues are indicative of a flawed character or are simply phases that will pass with time. This perspective can lead to detrimental outcomes as it often results in ignoring the problem or attributing it to personality defects, as seen in Zhang's case. When Zhang expressed his distress during the math exam, his father's dismissal of the behavior as mere pretense or a product of poor upbringing by his mother illustrates a widespread misunderstanding of psychological health. It's essential to educate parents and guardians about the nature of psychological disorders and the importance of early intervention.\n\nIn my consultation process, I emphasize the need for parents to understand that psychological problems are not necessarily indicative of mental illness. Psychological issues, particularly in adolescents, are often episodic and situational, linked to specific emotions or environmental conditions. They represent a temporary imbalance in normal psychological activities and can often be addressed through timely and appropriate interventions. Understanding this distinction can alleviate the stigma associated with seeking psychological help and encourage both students and parents to address these issues head-on rather than avoiding them due to fear of labeling.\n\nAnother critical aspect is the fear among students themselves. The case of the anonymous girl who reached out to me highlights a pervasive fear of being judged or labeled as \"mentally unstable.\" This fear can prevent students from seeking help, exacerbating their distress and prolonging their suffering. It is vital to create a supportive environment where students feel safe and encouraged to express their struggles without fear of judgment. Schools, families, and mental health professionals must work collaboratively to foster an atmosphere of acceptance and understanding, reassuring students that seeking help is a courageous and positive step.\n\nThe fear of affecting academic performance is another barrier to addressing mental health issues. Many students, like Song, delay seeking help due to concerns about missing classes or falling behind in their studies. However, this approach often leads to more severe problems that can significantly disrupt both their academic and personal lives. As practitioners, we must advocate for a balanced approach where mental health is prioritized alongside academic achievement. Interventions should be integrated into the students' schedules in a way that minimizes disruption but ensures that their psychological well-being is not compromised.\n\nTeachers also play a crucial role in the early identification and management of psychological issues in students. The case of Zhao illustrates how misinterpretation of a student's behavior as mere stubbornness or character flaws can lead to inadequate responses that may worsen the student's condition. Teachers are often the first to notice changes in students' behavior and performance, making it imperative for them to receive proper training in recognizing the signs of psychological distress and understanding the appropriate steps to take. Building strong partnerships between teachers, parents, and mental health professionals is vital to creating a comprehensive support system for students.\n\nReflecting further, the solution to addressing psychological problems in adolescents lies in a holistic approach that involves the student, their family, and the school environment. Each of these elements contributes to the student's overall well-being and requires coordinated efforts to ensure effective outcomes. Parents should be educated about the nature of psychological issues and encouraged to adopt a supportive and non-judgmental approach toward their children's challenges. Schools should implement programs that promote mental health awareness and provide resources for students to seek help discreetly and confidently.\n\nMoreover, mental health professionals must remain vigilant and adaptable, employing evidence-based interventions tailored to the individual needs of each student. Techniques such as metacognitive interventions can be particularly effective in helping students develop self-awareness and self-regulation skills, allowing them to manage their emotions and behaviors more effectively. Encouraging students to engage in reflective practices can also empower them to understand their thought processes and emotional responses, fostering resilience and self-efficacy.\n\nIn conclusion, addressing the psychological problems of middle school students requires a comprehensive and compassionate approach that acknowledges the complexities of adolescent development. By dispelling misconceptions, reducing stigma, and fostering a supportive environment, we can help students navigate their challenges and emerge stronger, more resilient individuals. Our ultimate goal should be to create a culture where mental health is prioritized, and students are empowered to thrive both academically and personally, leading to a fulfilling and balanced life. Through collective efforts and a commitment to understanding and addressing the unique needs of adolescents, we can pave the way for a healthier and more supportive future for all students.", "causes": "Adolescent secondary school students are psychologically imbalanced in the face of academic pressures and tend to be bored with school.", "symptoms": "Anxiety, depression, uncontrollable behavior, anorexia.", "treatment_process": "Metacognitive Intervention Techniques: Encouraging students to engage in reflective practices empowers them to understand their own thought processes and emotional responses, thereby developing resilience and self-efficacy.

Its characteristic is quick and effective therapeutic results. It assists clients in identifying positive experiences from their past to enhance their confidence and quickly find methods and strength to solve problems. It does not get entangled in searching for the causes of problems or in continuous analysis and processing.\n\n2. Case Overview: (In consideration of client confidentiality, names are pseudonyms, and certain details like location are omitted.) Xiao Qiang, a 14-year-old boy in the first year of junior high school, has run away from home multiple times, skipped school, and has a close relationship with two classmates. They skip school and run away together, and he often steals food and money from home. The family has tried various methods, but Xiao Qiang continues his behavior. His family, including relatives and friends, often mobilizes to search for him, hoping he will return home and go to school. Meanwhile, they have contacted the families of his two classmates multiple times, hoping to control the children and isolate them as strictly as possible, but it only worsens the situation, causing the three children to unite even more closely, leaving the three families helpless and anxious. Xiao Qiang's mother, in desperation, is willing to go along with his bad behavior as long as he can maintain contact with her and come home occasionally. The parents feel powerless and are in great pain. After persuasion from friends, they brought Xiao Qiang in for counseling.\n\n3. Summary of the Counseling Process: On the day Xiao Qiang entered the counseling room, it was quite a \"spectacle.\" Accompanying him were nine people, including his father, mother, cousin, uncle, aunt, and others. He was neither at the front nor the back but was squeezed in the middle. His mother entered first and explained, \"This child often goes missing; the whole family has mobilized to find him. It was not easy to bring him here, as he has been running away.\" She mentioned that he insisted that no one could help and wanted everyone to see how he would deal with the teacher. He wanted his mother to enter the counseling room with him while the others waited outside. After entering, Xiao Qiang immediately sat in a chair near the door, with his mother diagonally opposite him. At this point, Teacher Wang asked the mother and Xiao Qiang to switch seats, and the teacher sat next to Xiao Qiang. Teacher Wang smiled while listening to the mother's account and occasionally exchanged smiles with Xiao Qiang, who was somewhat evasive and slowly lowered his head. After entering, the mother first described the situation, frequently glancing at Xiao Qiang's expression, fearing she might say something wrong. Xiao Qiang showed no expression, muttering, \"I have nothing to say.\" The mother stated that Xiao Qiang used to be a good student, but after associating with those two bad kids, he changed. When the mother referred to his friends as bad kids, he glared at her and interrupted, saying they were not bad kids. During the mother's account, Teacher Wang occasionally asked her questions, such as what a good child looks like in her eyes and how to identify a bad child. He also inquired whether the mother understood the reasons behind Xiao Qiang's behavior today, suggesting that perhaps he had his own reasonable justifications for his actions, and whether adults might have misunderstood him. At the last question, Teacher Wang noticed Xiao Qiang's eyes were slightly red, so he paused, held Xiao Qiang's hand, and kindly said, \"The teacher senses Xiao Qiang's grievances and believes he has his reasons.\" After a while, Xiao Qiang spoke up: \"My friends are not bad kids; they are very righteous. We three share joys and hardships together. They skip school and run away because their parents are too harsh on them. In fact, they are quite pitiful.\" Teacher Wang responded, \"Oh, I see. Can you tell the teacher more about your situation?\" Xiao Qiang raised his head slightly and said, \"I used to study well; it's not that I don't want to go to school, but the three of us are good friends, and we vowed to share joys and hardships together. They weren't always like this; they made mistakes, and when they went home, their parents got angry and hit them, so they had to run away. Since I'm friends with them, I can't just leave them to go to school alone; I have to stay with them.\" Teacher Wang empathized with Xiao Qiang, saying, \"You are very loyal; aren't you like the three sworn brothers in a utopia?\" Xiao Qiang couldn't help but smile. Teacher Wang continued, \"In this regard, I admire you because you are very loyal to your friends. Many adults don't do as well as you do in this aspect.\" Hearing this, Xiao Qiang's expression became more natural and gentle, and he leaned back comfortably in the chair, letting his feet dangle freely in the air. At this moment, his mother interjected, \"He is very good to these friends, taking food from home to give to them and even taking money. When he asks us for money and we don't give it, he pries open the cabinet when we're not around and takes the money. He has been taking more and more.\" Teacher Wang laughed and said, \"Xiao Qiang is really 'saving the world!'\" Xiao Qiang quickly explained, \"Teacher Wang, this money is not just for my two friends; it's also for other students at our school who have run away and have no money. My friends actually don’t want my money; they are really good to me. They don’t want to influence me; they say I am a good student and should go back to school and not hang out with them anymore. When the three of us are together, if we only have five yuan and it's not enough to eat, we would rather throw it away and starve together without any complaints. Now they have even planned to commit suicide together but keep telling me to go back to school.\" At this point, Xiao Qiang stopped, tears filled his eyes, but he seemed to be trying desperately to hold them back. At this moment, Teacher Wang handed Xiao Qiang a tissue. Xiao Qiang wiped his tears and looked up at Teacher Wang, saying, \"I actually really want to die with them.\" Teacher Wang gently replied, \"The teacher knows you want to help your friends; you just don't know how to do it, right?\" Xiao Qiang answered, \"Yes.\" Teacher Wang continued, \"Xiao Qiang, the three of you are like falling into a deep mud pit. You don't want anything to happen to your friends, and you want to save them, but you are also in the mud pit right now. Think about it, how can you save your friends?\" Xiao Qiang thought for a moment, looking puzzled, and said he didn’t know. Teacher Wang said, \"If someone came to the edge of the mud pit and offered you a rope, what would you do?\" Xiao Qiang said, \"I would grab the rope and climb up first, then find the rope to pull them up.\" Teacher Wang happily replied, \"That's a smart move.\" \"Connect this story to Xiao Qiang's current situation. If Xiao Qiang really wants to help his friends, shouldn't he first stand up himself and go back to school, then work with his parents to persuade their parents and help them change their views and educational methods? If their parents are willing, Teacher Wang will definitely help. When their parents see Xiao Qiang's changes, they will surely reflect on themselves and change their unreasonable thoughts and actions for the sake of their children. How does Xiao Qiang feel about this method?\" After pondering for a while, Xiao Qiang said this method was somewhat good. Xiao Qiang's mother also reflected, \"It’s our fault for not handling it well, always trying to separate them and not allowing them to interact. I am willing to do as Teacher Wang suggested and communicate with the parents of those two classmates to persuade them, and to work with my son to help those two friends.\" At this point, Xiao Qiang was much happier and said to Teacher Wang, \"Teacher, I will go back to school next week, but I still can't go now; I can't let them die.\" Teacher Wang encouraged, \"Yes, the teacher supports you, and I believe your parents will support you too and help you do a good job with them.\" \n\n4. Result Feedback: It was later learned that Xiao Qiang returned to school, making significant efforts, and with the cooperation of the three parents, effectively resolved the suicide plan of the two classmates."], "experience_and_reflection": "The consultation process with Xiao Qiang and his family was a deeply enlightening experience, one that provided profound insights into the dynamics of child behavior, family interactions, and the practical application of Solution-Focused Brief Therapy (SFBT). Reflecting on the session, it becomes clear that the therapeutic journey involved not only addressing Xiao Qiang's immediate challenges but also initiating a transformative process within the family unit and beyond.\n\nInitially, the case presented itself as a classic example of adolescent rebellion exacerbated by familial and social factors. Xiao Qiang's behavior, characterized by frequent runaways, truancy, and theft, was understandably alarming to his parents and the broader family network. The family’s response, while well-intentioned, was rooted in control and containment, aiming to isolate Xiao Qiang from his peers whom they perceived as negative influences. This approach, however, inadvertently strengthened the bond between Xiao Qiang and his friends, reinforcing their collective defiance and deepening the family's sense of helplessness.\n\nThe entrance of Xiao Qiang into the counseling room, accompanied by an entourage of concerned family members, set the stage for a unique therapeutic encounter. The physical arrangement in the room, with Xiao Qiang initially positioned near the door, symbolically represented his emotional distance and the defensive posture he had adopted. Through subtle yet strategic interventions, such as switching seats to sit next to him, I sought to bridge this gap, signaling a readiness to meet him where he was both physically and emotionally.\n\nThe dialogue with Xiao Qiang’s mother revealed her deep-seated fears and frustrations, which were compounded by her belief that her son’s challenges were externally driven by 'bad influences'. Her narrative was punctuated with frequent glances towards Xiao Qiang, indicative of her anxiety over saying something that might exacerbate the situation. This dynamic highlighted a critical therapeutic task: to realign the family’s focus from blame and externalization towards understanding and empathy.\n\nIn probing the nature of 'good' versus 'bad' children, the conversation shifted towards an exploration of underlying motivations and contextual factors influencing Xiao Qiang’s behavior. This line of inquiry was crucial in reframing the problem from a moralistic dichotomy to a more nuanced understanding of Xiao Qiang's loyalty and the pressures he faced. A pivotal moment occurred when Xiao Qiang, through tears, expressed his desire to 'die with' his friends, revealing the depth of his emotional entanglement and the perceived hopelessness of their situation.\n\nThe therapeutic intervention took a turn towards solution-focused strategies, leveraging Xiao Qiang’s strengths, such as loyalty and empathy, to envision a pathway out of the 'mud pit'. By introducing the metaphor of the rope, a tangible symbol of hope and agency, the conversation opened a space for Xiao Qiang to consider alternative actions that aligned with his values yet offered a constructive resolution. This approach exemplified the essence of SFBT: building solutions from the client’s existing competencies and envisioning a future less dominated by present adversities.\n\nThis session also underscored the importance of addressing parental perceptions and strategies. Xiao Qiang’s mother, through the process, gained insights into her own role in inadvertently perpetuating the cycle of conflict and resistance. Her willingness to reconsider her stance and collaborate with the other parents was a testament to the transformative potential of reflective dialogue. It highlighted a fundamental aspect of effective child education: the necessity for parents to adapt and evolve in response to their child's developmental needs and the socio-emotional landscape they navigate.\n\nThe outcome of the session was encouraging, with Xiao Qiang's eventual return to school and the dismantling of his friends’ suicide plan being significant milestones. These changes were facilitated not by coercion or punishment but through empowerment, empathy, and collective problem-solving. The family's shift towards a more supportive and understanding approach played a crucial role in these positive developments.\n\nThis case serves as a reminder of the intricate interplay between individual behavior, peer influences, and familial dynamics. It reinforces the need for clinicians to remain attuned to the relational context of the client’s life and to engage with it in a manner that is both compassionate and strategic. The session with Xiao Qiang and his family demonstrated that therapeutic success is often contingent upon the capacity to harness the client's intrinsic resources and to cultivate a collaborative environment where new possibilities can emerge.\n\nMoreover, the experience reaffirmed the efficacy of SFBT in addressing complex behavioral issues. By focusing on solutions rather than problems, and by emphasizing the client’s agency and strengths, this approach facilitates rapid yet profound change. It encourages clients to envision and work towards their preferred futures, thereby transforming their lived realities.\n\nIn summary, the consultation with Xiao Qiang was a profound learning experience, both professionally and personally. It highlighted the transformative power of empathy, the importance of family involvement, and the resilience of youth when given the right support and guidance. As a clinician, it was a privilege to witness and facilitate this process, and it continues to inform my practice with a renewed commitment to fostering hope and change in the lives of my clients.", "causes": "A middle school student, Xiao Qiang, accompanied his friend to run away from home and skip school because of his loyalty to the friend.", "symptoms": "Frequent running away from home, skipping school, stealing food and money from home, despair over friend's plight of trying to commit suicide.", "treatment_process": "Listening and empathy: Establishing a trusting relationship and encouraging the visitor to express thoughts and feelings;\n Focused short-term therapy: Using Qiang's strengths, such as loyalty and empathy, to conceptualize a way out of the \"quagmire\" (friend facing suicide).

Fourteen years ago, his father-in-law fell ill, and his wife went back to her parents' home to take care of him. She did not return for half a month. He was busy with work at that time and did not visit his father-in-law. Once his work calmed down, he went to his father-in-law's house and saw that his wife was staying in her father's room. Next to the father-in-law's big bed was a small bed. He felt it was somewhat inappropriate at the time but did not say anything.

Since they were at his father-in-law's house, he didn't want to say anything further, fearing it would make them the subject of ridicule. He forced his wife to go home with him immediately. His wife followed him home without having breakfast.", "Returning to his own home, Feijian felt that he hadn't misheard, but he chose not to bring it up again, hoping that he was mistaken. The following few months passed without incident.", "After that, his wife would return to her family a few times a year, and he would go with her. If he really didn't have time to go, he wouldn't let her stay overnight at her family’s home. Although his wife no longer stayed overnight at her family’s, the number of times she returned home was actually increasing.", "During this time, Feijian subtly expressed his doubts to his mother-in-law, but she scolded him for being mentally ill. After that, he was unable to go to his father-in-law's house. However, whenever his wife stayed overnight at her parents' home, he would go at night to eavesdrop beneath the back window of his father-in-law's house, suffering greatly each time. When he returned, he would argue with his wife, but it led to no resolution. He wanted a divorce, but thinking of their young child, he never made up his mind.", "Twelve years ago, Fei Jian had a work-related injury that affected his kidneys, leading to renal failure, and he has been undergoing regular dialysis since then. From that point on, he could no longer do heavy work and needed his wife to take care of him. The prospect of divorce seemed even more distant because he felt that if he divorced, no one would be able to take care of him; his wife was providing him with a certain level of care in daily life.", "I want to get a divorce, but I feel conflicted; this is how I've lived for over a decade.", "Feijian seeks advice from a counselor to determine whether to get a divorce and how to alleviate the pain if he chooses not to divorce.", "In the consultation, I, as the counselor, understood his pain and his predicament, as well as his desire for his wife to change and live well with him. After six hours of counseling, Xiao Li Feidao felt much better. He said: during this consultation, he spoke freely about the emotional knots he had held for many years, feeling understood and listened to, with confidentiality ensured. This gratitude is impossible to express in words. Although the counselor did not tell him whether to divorce or not, that no longer mattered. What was important was that his inner turmoil had eased, and his pain had diminished.", "Feijian said, \"Since you don't want a divorce, why suffer so much?\"", "The consultation ended after 6 hours. In this consultation, Feijian's goal was very clear: he did not want a divorce but hoped to accept reality. Besides providing him with ample understanding and support, the counselor could not do much more. This is a case from 2012."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on this intricate and multifaceted case, it becomes apparent that the challenges faced by Feijian extend beyond the immediate distress of the suspected affair. This case reveals layers of psychological, emotional, and relational complexities that require careful analysis. As a clinician, the initial step was to ensure a safe space where Feijian could articulate his experiences and feelings without fear of judgment or breach of confidentiality. This foundational trust allowed for a more thorough exploration of his emotional landscape.\n\nFeijian's story is one marked by profound betrayal and emotional turmoil. The alleged affair between his wife and father-in-law presents an unusual and deeply disturbing scenario that challenges social norms and personal boundaries. Feijian's recounting of the events is characterized by a mix of shock, disbelief, and an overwhelming sense of helplessness. He is caught in a web of familial obligations, personal doubts, and a deteriorating health condition, all of which compound his emotional distress.\n\nThe narrative therapy approach employed in this case was crucial in helping Feijian externalize his problem. By seeing the issue as separate from himself, he was able to explore it more objectively and gain insight into his reactions and feelings. This separation is particularly important given the intimate and potentially stigmatizing nature of the affair. Through narrative therapy, Feijian could reframe his experience, which allowed him to see his situation from different perspectives, potentially alleviating some of his emotional burden.\n\nOne significant aspect of this case is the cultural and familial dynamics at play. The traditional expectation of filial piety, especially in certain cultures, might have contributed to the initial dismissal of Feijian's concerns. His wife's insistence on caring for her father, despite the unusual circumstances, could be rooted in deep-seated cultural values that prioritize family loyalty over marital commitments. Understanding these cultural nuances is essential in providing culturally competent care and avoiding pathologizing behaviors that might be normative in different cultural contexts.\n\nMoreover, Feijian's health condition adds another layer of complexity. His renal failure and dependency on dialysis create a situation where he feels trapped in his marriage out of necessity rather than choice. This dependency can exacerbate feelings of powerlessness and entrapment, potentially leading to a cycle of resentment and emotional distress. Addressing Feijian's health concerns and exploring options for support outside his marriage might be crucial steps in empowering him to make decisions that are in his best interest.\n\nIn retrospect, one of the challenges in this case was balancing Feijian's need for support with the ethical boundaries of therapy. While providing empathy and understanding, it was important not to impose my values or decisions on him. The goal was not to direct him toward a specific action, such as divorce, but to help him reach a place of clarity where he could make informed choices about his future. This aligns with the principles of client-centered therapy, where the client's autonomy and ability to make decisions are respected and supported.\n\nThrough our sessions, it became clear that Feijian's primary goal was not necessarily to resolve the issue of the affair but to find a way to live with the situation without it consuming his emotional well-being. This realization shifted the focus of therapy from problem-solving to acceptance and coping strategies. Helping Feijian identify his strengths and resources, both internal and external, was key in building his resilience and capacity to endure his circumstances.\n\nA significant turning point in our sessions was when Feijian acknowledged his desire to prioritize his well-being over the unresolved issue of his wife's fidelity. This shift in perspective allowed him to focus on what he could control—his reactions and responses—rather than the actions of others. This empowerment was crucial in reducing his feelings of helplessness and fostering a sense of agency.\n\nReflecting on this case also highlights the importance of exploring underlying issues that may not be immediately apparent. Feijian's history of trauma, both from his health condition and the perceived betrayal, likely contributed to his current emotional state. Addressing these past traumas through therapeutic techniques such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) could have been beneficial in helping him process his emotions and develop healthier coping mechanisms.\n\nIn considering this case further, it is also important to acknowledge the potential for secondary trauma or vicarious trauma experienced by the clinician. The intensity of Feijian's experiences and the emotional weight of his story required careful self-reflection and supervision to ensure that I remained effective and empathetic in my role as a therapist.\n\nUltimately, the insights gained from this case emphasize the need for a holistic approach to therapy that considers the interplay of cultural, familial, health, and emotional factors. It also underscores the importance of empowering clients to navigate their unique challenges with dignity and self-determination. By fostering a therapeutic environment of trust, respect, and empathy, clinicians can support clients like Feijian in finding a path to peace and acceptance, even in the most challenging of circumstances.", "causes": "Emotional trauma caused by suspected infidelity between wife and father-in-law.", "symptoms": "Despair and distress over wife's betrayal.", "treatment_process": "Narrative therapy: By separating the problem from the self, the client is able to explore the problem more objectively and gain a deeper understanding of her own reactions and emotions.

We need to focus our attention on the present, on reality. You have the ability to learn well and perform well on exams; that is the reality. As long as you are sure of this, let those thoughts flash by.\"", "In the second half of the first consultation, we discussed the best ways for the child to regulate their sleep and developed an exercise plan. Towards the end, we also involved the mother, primarily to provide the child with more emotional support, help reduce stress, and assist the child in completing homework.", "Later, the parents reported that their child was very happy on the way home, and they themselves felt relieved. I told the parents that addressing exam anxiety involves dealing with issues on different levels: first improving the child's emotions and building some confidence, and then focusing on the problem of exam anxiety. It will require a few more consultations to consolidate the progress. Two days later, the parents scheduled a second consultation.", "During the second consultation, the child told me that both sleep and learning had improved, but it was still not ideal.

As I mentioned, we need to have a broader perspective. In fact, with your true learning ability, as long as you can stabilize your emotions, you will excel wherever you go!\"", "The second consultation focused on boosting the child's confidence. Through in-depth discussions from various angles, the child gradually developed a positive mindset. She understood that her fear of exams affected her performance during the tests. By reducing this fear and not viewing the college entrance examination in absolute terms, she adjusted her perspective, which allowed her to approach the situation with ease.", "Our homework this time involved the imagined desensitization method, and after the children returned home, they were assisted by their parents to continue with the desensitization process. Through repeated training, the automatic tension in the body is alleviated, and new positive experiences are established.", "A week later, we had our third consultation. The child shared her progress and told me she felt much better. She said that sometimes she still feels down, mainly because her relationship with her father is not good; her father is not only indifferent but also very strict.", "\"Hearing you say that, I feel that it's not that Dad doesn't care about you, but rather that he doesn't know how to care for you, right?\"", "\"Well, he cares about me, but he gets anxious when he speaks and is especially fierce towards me.\"", "\"Even if he cares about you, his way of doing things can hurt you.\"", "\"Yes, it really hurt me.

Later, I talked to her mother for a few minutes, encouraging her to try to gain the cooperation of the child's father to provide a good environment for the child.", "In the follow-up visit, the parents indicated that the child is in good condition, and the child's father has also made adjustments in education."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on this case, I am struck by the complex interplay of factors contributing to the child’s exam anxiety, and how they underscore the critical importance of addressing emotional and psychological issues with a comprehensive approach. When faced with children's anxiety, depression, or other emotional issues, it is not uncommon for parents to underestimate the depth of these experiences, often perceiving them as mere overthinking. This case exemplifies how such perceptions can inadvertently contribute to the persistence of these issues, thereby prolonging the child's distress and potentially leading to more severe consequences if left unaddressed.\n\nThe child in this case presented with severe test anxiety, compounded by an inability to sleep and depressive emotions, which significantly hindered her academic performance and overall well-being. Her introverted nature and difficulty in expressing herself further exacerbated these challenges, making it difficult for her to seek help or articulate her needs effectively. This highlights a crucial aspect of working with children and adolescents: the need to create a safe and supportive environment where they feel comfortable sharing their experiences and emotions.\n\nFrom the outset, it was apparent that her anxiety was not an isolated issue but rather a symptom of deeper psychological and emotional factors, including familial dynamics and self-perception. During our consultations, it became clear that the child's fear of failure was deeply entrenched, influenced by past experiences of setbacks and a perceived lack of support or understanding from significant figures in her life. This fear was not merely about the exams themselves but extended to broader concerns about her future and self-worth.\n\nIn exploring these fears, it was essential to help the child recognize the distorted nature of her catastrophic thinking. Her belief that failing the exam would render her future bleak was a key focus of our cognitive therapy sessions. We worked together to deconstruct these thoughts, examining their validity and exploring alternative perspectives. This cognitive restructuring was vital in helping her reduce the fear that was paralyzing her, allowing her to approach her studies and exams with a more balanced mindset.\n\nAn important turning point in our sessions was helping the child shift her perspective on failure and success. By reframing failure not as a definitive endpoint but as a potential learning opportunity, we began to erode the power that fear held over her. This required a delicate balance of acknowledging her aspirations and the pressure she felt, while simultaneously emphasizing the myriad of pathways available to her, irrespective of her exam outcomes. It was crucial to instill a sense of resilience, reinforcing that her worth and potential were not solely contingent on academic performance.\n\nIn parallel, we addressed her sleep issues, which were both a symptom and a contributor to her anxiety. Together, we developed a sleep hygiene routine and incorporated relaxation techniques to help manage her nighttime anxiety. The integration of physical exercise also played a dual role in improving her physical well-being and providing a healthy outlet for stress relief.\n\nInvolving her mother in the therapeutic process was another strategic decision that proved beneficial. By engaging her mother, we aimed to bolster the child’s support system, ensuring that she had a source of emotional reassurance and encouragement at home. This also served to alleviate some of the isolation she felt, knowing that her challenges were understood and validated by her family.\n\nThe family dynamic, particularly the relationship with her father, was a significant area of exploration. The child’s perception of her father as indifferent and strict was a source of emotional pain and contributed to her stress. Through our discussions, it became apparent that her father’s behavior, while harsh, was motivated by a deep concern for her future. Helping the child see beyond her father’s strictness to his underlying intentions was a pivotal step in reducing the emotional burden she carried. This reframing helped mitigate the negative impact of their interactions on her self-esteem and performance anxiety.\n\nAs we delved deeper into the family dynamics, it became clear that the father’s anxiety about his daughter’s future was inadvertently communicated to her, compounding her own fears and pressures. Encouraging open communication within the family and fostering a more empathetic understanding between the child and her father was a critical aspect of our work. By facilitating a dialogue, we aimed to cultivate a more nurturing and supportive family environment, which is essential for the child’s emotional health and academic success.\n\nThe progress observed in this case underscores the importance of a multifaceted therapeutic approach that addresses not only the individual’s symptoms but also the broader context in which they exist. This holistic perspective is crucial in promoting lasting change and resilience. The integration of cognitive therapy, parental involvement, and attention to the child’s overall well-being highlights the need for adaptability and creativity in therapeutic practice.\n\nReflecting on the broader implications of this case, it is evident that addressing children's psychological issues requires sensitivity to their unique experiences and an understanding of the systemic factors that contribute to their distress. Early intervention and family involvement are key components in preventing the escalation of anxiety and depression in children and adolescents. As practitioners, it is our responsibility to advocate for comprehensive care that considers the whole child, recognizing that their struggles are often intertwined with familial and social contexts.\n\nFurthermore, this case serves as a reminder of the resilience that children and adolescents can develop when supported appropriately. By fostering an environment of understanding, patience, and encouragement, we can empower young individuals to overcome their challenges and develop the skills necessary for future success. It is imperative that we continue to educate and collaborate with families, schools, and communities to create supportive networks that prioritize the mental health and well-being of our youth.\n\nIn conclusion, the reflections drawn from this case have deepened my appreciation for the intricate relationship between a child’s emotional health and their academic performance. It has reinforced the importance of addressing both the individual and systemic aspects of anxiety, highlighting the need for personalized, empathetic, and comprehensive therapeutic strategies. As I continue to work with children and families, I am committed to advocating for holistic approaches that support not only the immediate resolution of symptoms but also the long-term development of emotional resilience and well-being.", "causes": "Fear of exams caused by the experience of failing high school entrance exams and the lack of a supportive family environment.", "symptoms": "Difficulty sleeping, depression, test anxiety disorder.", "treatment_process": "Cognitive therapy: By changing the visitor's catastrophic and distorted perception of exam failure, thus realizing that success or failure in life does not lie in an exam, easing her paralysis caused by fear and enabling her to face her studies and exams with a more balanced mindset.\n Family therapy: By changing the father's strict parenting style, a supportive family system is built for the visitor.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Influenced by past frustrating experiences and lack of support or understanding from important people in her life, the fear is not limited to the exam itself, but extends to broader concerns about the future and self-worth.", "treatment_effect": "Through cognitive therapy and systematic desensitization, the counselor helps the client to change irrational cognitions, eliminate catastrophic imagery of exam failure, and enhance her psychological resilience and ability to cope with current exam stress."}

This regret and guilt had lingered in his heart.", "In a hypnotic state, the child entered a room that was completely empty. He was guided to see a photograph on the wall, and upon closer inspection, it was of his grandmother sitting in a chair, quietly watching him in the room. The child spoke to the photograph about his regret and guilt for not seeing his grandmother one last time, and how he missed her very much. At that moment, the grandmother silently shed tears. She gently told the child that he was her favorite too, and she wanted to see him in her final moments. But now that she knew he was also sick and in the hospital at that time, she felt at peace. She said, \"You miss me so much, and that makes me very happy. You have grown up now, and I hope you take good care of your mother.\" The child replied to his grandmother, \"Please believe me, I will definitely take good care of Mom. With your blessing, I will be the best, please believe me.\" In the end, the grandmother ascended to heaven, riding on clouds.", "After waking up, the child said that suddenly their heart opened up, and they felt sunlight shining into their heart.

After a few phone calls, it was confirmed that we would meet again in the afternoon. During this process, I could sense that the child had some resistance.

Last Friday, the child missed the appointment.", "When preparing to do hypnosis, the child held a silver cross in his hand. He was reluctant to put it down and asked me if I believed in the existence of God. I honestly told him that I believed, and my God is myself. He said he didn't know either, but holding this cross could prevent the appearance of vampires. It turned out that on Saturday night, the child had a terrifying dream.

The devil says that I should not continue seeing Teacher Zong, as his words are meant to make you confront a painful past. Those events are too painful; why should I seek more suffering? Even if I face them, the result will still be the same. The angel insists that I must see Teacher Zong, as he will lead me towards the light and create something wonderful for me, so I definitely have to go. Yet, I have no personal opinion and do not know whose words to follow. In the midst of their fierce argument, I woke up.", "The child also told me that when they used to decide to do something, they would dream of either an angel or a devil, receiving specific advice. They would often listen to their suggestions. However, when wanting to fight, they would heed the devil's support and reject the angel's interference.", "Hearing this, I am filled with joy. It proves that Teacher Zong has approached the depths of the child's soul, reaching the deep waters of reform, and the child's inner struggle is inevitable. The two opposing forces in the child's subconscious are fiercely entangled regarding whether to continue growing. I believe a resolution will emerge.", "The child told me that for Teacher Zong, there is already a 5 out of 10 level of dislike. Because they are unwilling to face their own inner world, let alone allow Teacher Zong to enter their inner depths. I clearly understand that at this moment, if I continue to delve deeper, I will lose their trust and consequently the chance to get closer. So I changed my approach and chose to respect the child's feelings at this moment. In the future, they can decide for themselves. When needed, they can actively invite me, and I will provide help in a timely manner. However, the venue fee for next time will be borne by the child themselves. The child agreed happily.", "The child also mentioned that their current positive energy is one percent, while negative energy is ninety-nine percent. They hope to maintain this state and do not want to make any changes. An increase in negative energy leads to destruction. An increase in positive energy will result in playing pranks and hurting others, along with a further decline in a sense of security. They also particularly need the strength of negative energy. It is time to give the child some space.", "Finally, as usual, I extend my blessings and shake hands tightly. The child closes his eyes, and I can observe that the child's brows are moving, and the eyeballs are moving, indicating that he has entered a hypnotic state again. Although my hand is very sore, I keep persevering.", "Three minutes later, the child opened his eyes. He said that in his estate, there was a patch of yellow soil that was very dry. After walking over, he saw a spring bubbling up from the ground, crystal clear. The flow of water became larger and larger, very substantial. Later, the yellow mud turned into a rice paddy. He planted rice in the field, which grew slowly into mature grains. Many people came to help with the harvest, enjoying the joy of success. At that moment, he felt relaxed and sensed that his heart was filled with hope.", "Through the presentation of this scene, I know that the child will definitely look for me. My heart is also filled with beautiful hope.", "On June 21, the child's mother said that the child has been much calmer during this time and is looking forward to meeting and chatting with the teacher. I gladly went. The child dyed their hair and got a trendy hairstyle.", "In the coffee room, I ordered two cups of hot water as usual. The child said they felt good recently and hadn't thought much about things, feeling quite relaxed. They didn't dream at all while sleeping and slept soundly until dawn. Over the weekend, they encouraged each other with their girlfriend who went to school in Japan, making plans to meet after passing the entrance exam for a university in Tokyo.", "When establishing the chat topic, the child clearly expressed that he does not want to talk about his father, as it would touch on deep feelings. This is also the two most important and effective aspects. So, when I asked him what he wanted to talk about, he said he didn't know. How to continue the conversation is a challenge we face. I asked him to ask me questions he was interested in, and he laughed, saying he never explores other people's worlds. Later, based on past experience, I thought that a handshake could create a positive atmosphere. The plan was to shake hands for 10 minutes.", "After the two of them held hands, his eyes began to move, clearly entering a hypnotic state. I slowly said, \"You will feel a force slowly entering your body and mind...\" Five minutes later, I asked him what kind of image he saw, and he said it was a sea of white. It felt like a wall, and when he got closer, he saw some words. What he saw was \"You will succeed\" (later, when we restored the drawing, we realized it was in Japanese). I told him that this is the voice from deep within, and you will firmly believe that you will definitely succeed. I guided him further, and below the words, there was a door. He saw a large green door. When he pushed it open, he entered a green world. He saw a blue blooming rose. As he got closer, he saw the flower's center. From the center, a small fairy flew out, smiling gently at him. Then, with a start, he woke up. He felt a sense of lightness in his entire body. He remembered the hopeful green and the appearance of the small fairy. I asked the child to draw \"You will succeed and the door to success,\" and the appearance of the small fairy.", "Before leaving, I held his hand once more. In two minutes, the child naturally transformed into a little sprite, playing joyfully with the little sprite I had seen earlier."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on this complex case, I am reminded of the immense power inherent in the therapeutic relationship, a dynamic that is pivotal in facilitating healing and transformation. The journey with this child, who was caught in the nefarious web of the Blue Whale Game, underscores the significance of providing a space of unconditional positive regard and empathetic engagement. Through the lens of this case, I have come to appreciate more deeply how essential it is for clinicians to embody a consistent and nurturing presence, a kind of safe harbor in the often tumultuous sea of a young person's life.\n\nFrom the outset, the child's involvement in the Blue Whale Game and the progression to level 34 was a red flag signaling significant distress. The visible marks on the child’s arms were a stark testament to the internal turmoil they were experiencing. The child’s initial intent to challenge the game, to prove invincibility against the lure of death, speaks to a deeper existential struggle and a quest for meaning and self-validation. Such behavior often masks a profound sense of inadequacy and a desperate search for control in a seemingly uncontrollable world. This aligns with the core insight that often, behind such risky engagements, there lies a cry for help, a need to be seen and understood.\n\nThe use of hypnotherapy in this case proved to be a powerful tool in unveiling the subconscious fears and desires of the child. Hypnosis facilitated a safe exploration of the child's inner world, revealing metaphorical landscapes that mirrored their psychological state. The imagery of being pulled into the depths of the ocean and encountering a city of the dead was particularly telling. It illustrated the child’s deep-seated fears and the pervasiveness of death-related anxieties, likely exacerbated by their grandmother's passing and the associated unresolved guilt.\n\nThe therapeutic interventions employed sought to transform these haunting images into empowering narratives. By reframing the terrifying encounter with the dead city into a recognition of the brain's capacity to project fear from past negative experiences, we aimed to dismantle the irrational hold these fears had on the child. The subsequent imagery of holding onto Noah's Ark symbolized hope and salvation, a turning point that indicated the child's subconscious desire for safety and rescue from their turmoil.\n\nThe sessions that followed further deepened the therapeutic alliance and gradually peeled away layers of the child’s defenses. Through continued hypnosis, the child was able to address the long-held guilt surrounding their grandmother’s death. The imagery of a comforting interaction with the grandmother allowed for a cathartic release, a reweaving of their narrative to one where the grandmother's peace was contingent upon understanding the child's own illness. This was a pivotal moment of healing, offering the child a new perspective and freeing them from the shackles of guilt.\n\nA significant challenge emerged in addressing the child’s social anxieties and reluctance to communicate with adults. This fear of adult judgment and potential harm speaks to past experiences of invalidation or rejection, possibly compounded by the societal pressures and expectations placed upon young individuals. The gradual exposure exercises, such as maintaining eye contact, were small yet significant steps toward building self-confidence and dismantling the internalized fear of adult interactions.\n\nThe narrative of the child’s internal struggle between the angel and devil personas was particularly insightful, revealing an internal conflict about growth and change. This duality represents the ambivalence often encountered in therapy—where part of the self desires healing and progression, while another part fears the vulnerability and pain that might accompany such a journey. This internal conflict is a natural part of the therapeutic process, highlighting the necessity for patience and a non-judgmental stance from the clinician.\n\nIn our sessions, the child’s eventual expression of a dislike for delving deeper with Teacher Zong reflected a critical juncture in therapy. It underscored the importance of respecting the child’s pace and readiness for change. Pushing too hard could risk breaking the therapeutic alliance and stalling progress. Instead, by honoring the child’s current state and emphasizing their autonomy in seeking future support, we reinforced their sense of agency and control over their therapeutic journey.\n\nThe imagery of the dry patch of yellow soil transforming into a fertile rice paddy was a profound metaphor for growth and potential. It symbolized the child’s journey from a state of desolation to one of hope and regeneration. This transformation was not just about alleviating immediate distress but about instilling a sense of possibility and future success.\n\nThroughout this case, I have been continually reminded of the delicate balance between guiding the child towards introspection and allowing them space to process and integrate their experiences. As clinicians, we must remain attuned to the subtle cues of readiness and resistance, adapting our approach to foster a collaborative and empowering therapeutic process.\n\nThe child's eventual calmness and positive engagement in life, as reported by their mother, is a testament to the resilience and capacity for change that resides within. This case has reinforced my belief in the profound impact of a caring, consistent therapeutic presence. It serves as a reminder that as clinicians, we must continually practice empathy, patience, and humility, recognizing that the journey of healing is as much about being present and attentive as it is about employing specific therapeutic techniques.\n\nIn conclusion, the journey with this child has been a rich tapestry of learning and reflection, deepening my understanding of the complex interplay between fear, hope, and healing. It underscores the importance of a holistic approach that honors the child’s experiences, cultivates resilience, and nurtures the seeds of transformation. As I continue my practice, I am committed to embracing these insights, continually refining my approach to meet the unique needs of each individual in their journey towards well-being.", "causes": "The visitor's neurotic fear was triggered by her participation in the Blue Whale game.", "symptoms": "Nightmares, horrific imagery, panic attacks.", "treatment_process": "Hypnotherapy: Hypnotherapy allows the visitor to explore subconscious emotions, to come to terms with the traumatic experience of her grandmother's death, and to alleviate the fear of death.", "characteristics_of_illness": "A deep sense of low self-esteem and a desperate quest for control in a seemingly uncontrollable world underlie the client's participation in the Blue Whale game.", "treatment_effect": "Through hypnotherapy, the counselor helped the client to break the irrational control of the fear of death over the child, so that the child could realize spiritual growth and face the future with a peaceful and positive mindset."}
{"id": 130, "case_description": ["1. The visitor is a 30-year-old male of Han ethnicity, a seafarer with a bachelor's degree. He is married and has an 11-month-old daughter. He feels anxious and panicked during his first visit, with significant physical symptoms: headache, heartache, and dry heaving, and he can't sleep when lying down. He has previously sought treatment at Tianjin General Hospital and Tianjin Anding Hospital and has taken medications such as Deli Xin, Clonidine, and Aprazolam, but with no significant effect. Currently, he is only taking Clonidine and sleep medication, stating that he cannot sleep without the sleep medication. The visitor also mentions that he has been through life-threatening experiences, has seen a deity, and has been misled by some specialized hospitals in the Putian system, which has caused him a significant financial burden. After countless ineffective attempts and efforts, he finally came into the counseling room with a mindset of giving it a try."], "consultation_process": ["1. Visitor's main complaint: The visitor met his wife in 2013 and got married in June 2014. Before marriage, he learned that his wife had previous sexual experiences, which made him uncomfortable. He described himself as having a virgin complex, but after some time, this feeling eased. After their daughter was born, he experienced a sense of rebirth and happiness, but since August of this year, he has fallen back into the virgin complex. Four years ago, he heard a colleague say that if a woman has had sexual experiences before marriage, the children born after marriage are \"impure\" and that there would be influences from other men. He describes his problem as very serious, severely affecting his work and life. He is a sailor and has been recuperating at home for three months, unable to work. With these thoughts, he finds it difficult to love his child as he did before and has become estranged from his wife. However, he cannot openly express these feelings and describes himself as forcing a smile while being with his wife and child, as if wearing a mask, which causes him great pain. The visitor has searched online for many so-called \"paternal inheritance theory\" articles. Although these are labeled as pseudoscientific online, he feels that many people saying this makes sense and seems to have some scientific basis, which increases his anxiety and panic, leading to overthinking and resulting in insomnia, headaches, and heart-wrenching (gastric pain) symptoms. He has previously visited the district people's hospital and Tianjin General Hospital, where doctors prescribed Dulexetine without asking for any reasons, then later added other anti-anxiety medications like Clonazepam. Before taking these medications, he could still sleep, but after taking them, his sleep worsened. He later went to Tianjin Anxin Hospital, where each time he visited, the doctor prescribed anti-anxiety medications and eventually added sleep medications.", "Later, I bought psychological books such as \"Overcoming Anxiety in Seven Days\" at a book stall and felt that my issues were psychological rather than the neurosis the doctor described. I believed these problems were related to my personality. The visitor reported that since childhood, they have been fearful, timid, indecisive, selfish, perfectionistic, and overly sensitive. These traits were connected to their mother’s dominance and control, as well as their father's meekness and passivity. The dominant mother frequently argued with the honest father, and witnessing these fights in childhood caused panic and fear in the visitor, making them increasingly introverted and insecure. These feelings of fear and panic had appeared during school exams but subsided afterward. After starting elementary school, the visitor realized they were timid and afraid, avoiding playing with other children. However, due to their hard work in studies, they gained admission to a good undergraduate program and later joined a state-owned enterprise. This made them more cheerful and optimistic, but after getting married, they suddenly became trapped in a virgin complex, constantly falling into distress. Especially in the past three months, despite their efforts to adjust, they found it difficult to cope, which led them to seek help in the counseling room.", "3. Diagnosis or Assessment: Based on consultations with the visitor and in accordance with the psychological assessment standards and principles of psychological counseling, it is believed that the visitor exhibits significant anxiety and obsessive thoughts. However, these issues primarily stem from psychological problems. Short-term counseling aims to address the visitor's emotional issues, while long-term treatment focuses on resolving the visitor's psychological problems. The visitor's issues may seem to arise from the \"paternal inheritance theory,\" but underlying this is a \"virgin complex,\" which is rooted in feelings of inferiority and a sense of impurity, ultimately stemming from the insecurity caused by their parents' arguments during childhood.", "IV. The effects of consultation or treatment:", "The consultation was quite effective. By the end of the session, the visitor's stomach pain had disappeared, their headache had alleviated, and their mood had improved significantly. Before the session concluded, the counselor assessed the visitor through evaluation questions, and the visitor reported that their anxiety level had decreased from 10 to 5."], "experience_and_reflection": "1. Reflection and analysis on the success or failure of the counseling goals: As I reflect on this case, I am struck by the complexity of the issues the client faces and the nuanced way in which they have impacted his life. The counseling began with a focus on the client's immediate and distressing symptoms, such as anxiety and physical discomfort. By opening the dialogue around these embodied experiences, we were able to delve deeper into the client's personal history and the profound impact that family dynamics have had on his psychological development. While the counseling sessions were successful in alleviating some of the client's immediate anxiety, the journey towards a more profound transformation remains ongoing. The goal of completely overcoming the virgin complex and the associated feelings of impurity and insecurity is a challenging one, and it is clear that the client will require a sustained therapeutic engagement to achieve meaningful change. The recommendation for a course of psychotherapy extending beyond 10 sessions underscores the need for the client to engage in a process of personal growth, where he can cultivate a deeper understanding of himself and develop more adaptive ways of navigating his internal conflicts.\n\n2. Evaluation and reflection on the success or failure of the consultation process: Self-awareness developed during the consultation process was a critical aspect of this case. The application of externalization techniques from narrative therapy was particularly effective in helping the client articulate his emotions. By naming these emotions as \"inner demons\" and \"shadows,\" the client was able to externalize and engage with them in a tangible way. The use of a pillow to represent the \"inner demon\" provided a unique opportunity for the client to have a dialogue with his internal struggles. This process was deeply cathartic, allowing the client to express and release pent-up negative emotions, often leading to tears and a sense of relief.\n\nDuring the consultation, I was mindful of not positioning myself as an expert or pathologizing the client's experience. Instead, I aimed to create a collaborative environment where the client's voice was prioritized, and their expectations and needs were continuously validated. This approach ensured that the consultation remained client-centered and focused on their lived experience. By concretizing the client's bodily sensations and bringing them into the conversation, we were able to create a safer space for exploration, reducing the risk of feeling overwhelmed by the emotional content of the sessions.\n\nThe central psychological issue for the client revolved around a statement he heard from a colleague, which suggested that a woman's past sexual experiences could render her children impure and influenced by other men. This notion, deeply tied to the client's virgin complex, became a focal point of our discussions. It was essential to understand how the concept of \"impurity\" had been constructed in the client's mind and the role it played in his distress. By deconstructing this belief and examining its origins, we could begin to challenge and reframe these maladaptive thoughts.\n\nDuring one session, I employed a technique from my supervision with Teacher Haibo, which involved posing a hypothetical question about the client's relationship with his child. By asking how he would feel if the child were not biologically his, the client experienced an immediate sense of relief, suggesting that the biological connection was less critical than the emotional bond he had formed. This insight opened up new avenues for exploration and helped the client begin to disentangle his identity as a father from the virgin complex.\n\nAs I wrote this case report, I was reminded of the importance of authentically recording and utilizing the client's language. The terms and expressions the client uses are deeply personal and carry specific meanings unique to their experience. By honoring these words, we can gain a deeper understanding of the client's inner world and facilitate more effective therapeutic interventions.\n\nReflecting on the use of externalization techniques, I recognize that my skill in this area could be further developed. While the initial outcomes were positive, there is potential for more nuanced application of these strategies to deepen the client's engagement and facilitate more lasting change.\n\nKey Scenario Analysis: One of the pivotal moments in the consultation process involved inviting the client to embrace his \"inner demon.\" By encouraging him to make friends with this aspect of himself and share his troubles, we opened up a dialogue about the client's internal conflict. The \"inner demon\" spoke of lacking \"contribution, courage, and responsibility,\" which provided valuable insights into the client's self-perception and areas of struggle. This exercise highlighted the ongoing battle between the \"normal me\" and the \"abnormal me\" that the client experiences, contributing to his confusion and pain.\n\nOver the three years the client has lived with this inner demon, he has oscillated between submission and resistance. The more he attempts to be a good father, the more intense the torment becomes, driven by his indulgence in negative thoughts. This cycle of self-criticism and doubt perpetuates his suffering, and the inner demon's voice reinforces his perceived lack of confidence and courage.\n\nIn reflecting on this case, I am reminded of the importance of addressing the client's core beliefs and the narratives that sustain them. By working collaboratively to explore and reframe these narratives, we can help the client move towards a more integrated sense of self, where he can embrace his role as a father without the burden of past insecurities.\n\nThis case has deepened my understanding of the interplay between cultural beliefs, family dynamics, and individual psychology. The client's journey underscores the need for a culturally sensitive approach that considers the broader societal influences on personal identity. As we continue our work together, I am committed to supporting the client's growth and helping him find a path towards healing and self-acceptance.", "causes": "Anxiety and obsessive-compulsive thinking due to the inability to get close to the wife and daughter because of the virginity complex.", "symptoms": "Anxiety and obsessive-compulsive thinking with somatization symptoms such as insomnia and headache.", "treatment_process": "Narrative therapy: The counselor helps the client to externalize and name the \"inner demons\" of obsessive-compulsive thinking triggered by the virginity complex in a concrete and palpable way, and to vent the pent-up negative emotions through dialogues, reconstructing these narratives to help the client to move towards a more integrated self-knowledge, so that he or she can accept the role of fatherhood without the burden of the insecurity of the past.

A's father heard from a friend that Teacher Zheng was very capable in potential development, so he specifically brought A here. Both of A's parents are doctors, but A's grades are average, and he is about to enter high school. A first took the MMPI, and the teacher checked A's head energy and found that the child is actually quite excellent, but has been restricted. The energy line is trapped, leading to a mindset that cannot execute; he doesn't like being managed, lacks execution ability, and prefers to stick to his own opinions. After examining his body, A's navel is tightly closed, and his heart is shut off. The father also reflected that he feels a sense of restriction. The teacher patiently explained the mystery of the navel to the father and daughter, stating that A has a good nature and a yellow aura surrounding him. When opened, there is a lotus inside, and the pearls inside are shining, but they are tightly trapped inside, controlled by the mind, unable to break through the bottleneck. A has a bit of a temper and some strange thoughts that go against the norm. Upon checking other parts of the body, overall he seems healthy, but his heart is trapped. He likes to do things his own way and internally pursues freedom, disliking being suppressed, which is often related to his parents' strict requirements and past blows to his self-esteem. After hearing this, the father laughed heartily and agreed. Upon entering the room, A frequently used a tissue to wipe his nose, saying he has had rhinitis for several years, and sometimes his father, feeling annoyed, would tell him to stop wiping it.", "The teacher asked A if she was willing to practice here, and after A agreed, the teacher had her start with standing meditation. A's father asked if he could practice together, as he understood the power of this practice. The teacher said of course he could. When practicing abdominal breathing, the father mentioned that he was strict and had already realized that she was tightening up and couldn't relax. During the high school entrance exam, she scored around 400 points initially, but when she recognized her potential and aimed to do well, she ultimately scored over 490 points. Yes, it only matters if she wants to improve; the help would be useful only if she truly desires change, otherwise, it would just be a waste of effort. The teacher used needles to prick A's tongue, which startled her a bit; cool air and illness were expelled from her mouth, prompting her to quickly light incense. During the standing meditation, a strange smell emerged, and her body became warm.", "Under hypnosis, pressing the abdomen caused it to contract, and the tension in the head was eased, making the Baihui point in the immune system almost imperceptible. While this was happening, suddenly the teacher's right thigh felt tingly as if an electric current had passed through it, and I got goosebumps when I touched it. Under hypnosis, my eyes blinked unconsciously, and my feet trembled, with the right foot trembling more intensely. This was related to past setbacks and fears, and there was a feeling of unwillingness to resist. A saw that his mental palace was silver and filled with many books. He tested his sensitivity to freedom, which he particularly liked, while feeling a strong aversion to studying and reading. This aversion might stem from a misunderstanding or external pressure. On the surface, he didn't like books, but subconsciously, he did. He didn't actually resent them; he hoped to achieve results and was very ambitious, but he expressed his resistance in a different way, and over time, it became exhausting. He wanted parents to speak with artistry and humor.", "August 15, the second time", "As soon as A breathes, the heat rises, and the belly feels warm. A likes to make some facial micro-expressions. When standing in all directions, there is a pulsing sensation on the left side of the waist, which usually indicates constipation.

A stands in a stance, while the father sits nearby and dozes off, feeling quite sleepy as he didn’t take a nap at noon. The teacher asks him to stand together. A appears indifferent and not very enthusiastic, with a nonchalant attitude. The teacher cites examples of people who have come here, each transforming from weaklings into strong individuals, real and tangible changes. It is true that A has a treasure within, but if he doesn’t want to unlock it, no one can help him. Once unlocked, he will be full of energy and surpass his parents. The father, feeling anxious, says that if A doesn’t want to practice, he shouldn’t waste time; Teacher Zheng is very busy, and so is A. If A wants to practice, he should do it well here to unleash his potential. A says he wants to practice, while waking up his nose, and the father tells him not to wake up, as it gives him a headache. The teacher advises to stand well, as the turbid water from the body, like the turbid water from the eyes and nose, will come out, making him feel comfortable. A cooperates more during the standing practice, and his strength increases significantly. After testing his strength, he is able to carry me. Standing again for more energy, he carries me again with even more stability.", "Helping A to push away the knots in the abdomen, A showed a troubled expression. When looking into the teacher's eyes, it felt natural, and the intense pain from before was no longer present.

While helping the father adjust his stance, the teacher noticed that his hand lines were dark, his heart, lungs, and head were slightly bluish, and he had a bad temper, indicating excessive mental strain. The father was able to release quite a bit of energy during the practice. Since A entered the room, he hasn’t awakened his nose; after the last hypnosis session, he felt much better, especially after practicing at home.

By the end of the month, the final score was 676 points, an increase of 120-126 points, moving up over 400 ranks."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on the case of the young girl, A, with a hurt self-esteem and strict family upbringing, the experience has been a significant learning journey in understanding the profound impact of familial dynamics and psychological conditioning on adolescent development. Throughout this therapeutic engagement, it became increasingly clear how parental expectations and rigid discipline can inadvertently stifle a child's natural curiosity and zest for life. The case underscores the importance of fostering an environment that encourages self-discovery and personal growth, rather than imposing external standards that may not align with the child's intrinsic motivations and capabilities.\n\nA's situation is emblematic of many adolescents who struggle with school refusal and academic disengagement. Her dislike for studying and poor academic performance were symptomatic of deeper psychological barriers that were rooted in her family environment. Her parents, both doctors, carried a high level of anxiety about her future, projecting their professional expectations onto her, which inadvertently contributed to her feelings of inadequacy and resistance to traditional learning methods. The nasal inflammation that A suffered from was not merely a physical ailment but seemed to be intertwined with her psychological state, acting as a physical manifestation of the internal stress and tension she experienced.\n\nThe consultation process was revealing in many ways. Initially, A's father sought out my services with the hope of unlocking her potential, reflecting a common parental desire to see their children succeed academically. However, the initial assessment, including the MMPI and energy checks, indicated that A possessed a natural excellence that was unfortunately trapped by restrictive mindsets and familial pressures. Her energy line was blocked, indicative of her mindset that struggled to execute tasks and her aversion to being managed or directed. This blockage was further corroborated by her physical condition—the tightly closed navel and the shut-off heart—symbolizing her internalized suppression and the need for freedom.\n\nThe engagement with A's father was crucial, as it highlighted the need for parental involvement in the therapeutic process. His acknowledgment of feeling restricted himself provided a parallel to A's own experiences, suggesting that the family dynamics were impacting both generations. The process of explaining the mysteries of the navel and the symbolic lotus within was aimed at helping both A and her father understand the latent potential that lay within her, waiting to be unlocked. This potential was represented metaphorically by the shining pearls, trapped and controlled by the mind, unable to break through the bottleneck created by external pressures and internalized beliefs.\n\nA's temperament and unusual thoughts that diverged from conventional norms were indicative of her unique personality and her pursuit of personal freedom. This pursuit was often at odds with her parents' strict requirements, leading to repeated blows to her self-esteem. Her father's laughter upon hearing these observations was a moment of recognition and perhaps a turning point in understanding the need for a more supportive and nurturing approach.\n\nAs the therapeutic process progressed, standing meditation and abdominal breathing exercises were introduced as techniques to help A relax and unlock her potential. The father's realization of his own strictness and its impact on A was a critical step towards facilitating change. It was clear that the help would be effective only if A genuinely desired to improve; otherwise, it would be futile. This realization was reinforced through various techniques, including hypnosis and the use of needles to expel illness and negative energy, which startled A initially but helped clear blocked pathways.\n\nHypnosis sessions revealed deeper insights into A's subconscious, where her mental palace was filled with books, contrary to her surface aversion to reading. This paradox highlighted the internal conflict between her ambitions and her external expressions of resistance. A's sensitivity to freedom and her strong aversion to studying suggested that her resistance might be rooted in a misunderstanding or external pressure. Yet, subconsciously, she harbored ambitions and a desire to achieve results, albeit expressed in unconventional ways.\n\nThe recurring theme throughout the sessions was A's reluctance to fully engage with the process of potential development. Her indifference and apathy, coupled with her father's anxiety about time and productivity, created a challenging dynamic that required careful navigation. The emphasis was placed on the notion that unlocking A's treasure within was contingent upon her willingness to embrace change and actively participate in her own development.\n\nAs the sessions continued, A's physical symptoms, such as rhinitis, gradually improved, suggesting that the psychological interventions were having a positive impact on her overall well-being. Her cooperation during hypnosis demonstrated her excellent memory, surpassing even her father's, yet when it came to critical points of potential development, A's unwillingness to participate highlighted the limitations of therapy when faced with a lack of mutual cooperation.\n\nReflecting on this case, it is evident that strict parental discipline can lead to unintended consequences, such as the loss of initiative and enthusiasm in children. The goal should not be to train obedience but to cultivate a lively and cheerful disposition. Therapy is most effective when the desire for change and improvement originates from within the individual. This intrinsic motivation is the catalyst for meaningful transformation and the creation of miracles in therapy.\n\nMoreover, the case illustrates how physical symptoms can often have psychological underpinnings. A's nasal inflammation, constipation, and other bodily discomforts were intricately linked to her emotional state and familial interactions. The therapeutic process involved addressing these symptoms holistically, recognizing that mental and physical health are interconnected and must be treated as such.\n\nIn conclusion, the case of A serves as a poignant reminder of the complexities involved in adolescent psychotherapy. It highlights the critical role of family dynamics, parental expectations, and the need for a supportive and nurturing environment that respects the child's individuality. As clinicians, we must remain vigilant in our efforts to understand and address the multifaceted nature of psychological barriers, striving to unlock the potential within each individual through empathy, patience, and tailored interventions.", "causes": "Parents' high expectations and strict demands lead to children's self-denial and anorexia tendency.", "symptoms": "Anorexia, poor grades, rhinitis.", "treatment_process": "Hypnotherapy: Through imagery dialogues, the therapist creates an environment that encourages self-discovery and personal growth, helping the child to discover his or her own interest and potential in learning.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Excessive parental expectations and demands exacerbate the child's skepticism of his or her own abilities and resistance to traditional learning methods.", "treatment_effect": "Through hypnotherapy, the counselor helps the child discover his/her own energy and potential interest in learning, and encourages the child to pursue inner transformation and self-growth."}

Utilizing psychodynamic techniques can help improve psychological functioning and enhance awareness and insight."], "experience_and_reflection": "Hello! As promised, I have completed the summary case construction for our consultation work, albeit later than anticipated. In my effort to present a comprehensive reflection, I revisited our entire consultation process, delving into relevant clinical theories and analyzing case studies to deepen my understanding of our experiences and insights. Our sessions, which spanned over a year and encompassed thirty consultations, were certainly challenging yet rewarding. I hope that this written reflection will provide valuable insights, stimulate further thought, and possibly offer guidance as you continue on your journey.\n\nThroughout our consultations, a recurring theme was your struggle with authority figures, rooted deeply in your childhood experiences. This long-term psychological trauma has significantly shaped your interpersonal dynamics, particularly in the workplace. Your reserved and serious demeanor, which I observed during our sessions, seems to reflect a lifetime of navigating complex authority dynamics. It's possible that these behaviors, which may have been adaptive in your youth, have now become a source of tension and conflict in your professional life. You mentioned feeling trapped by these patterns, which lead to anxiety and depression, prompting you to seek counseling.\n\nIn the initial sessions, we touched on these issues tentatively, and some of my observations seemed to resonate with you. This initial understanding provided a foundation for our ongoing work, where we explored these dynamics more deeply. Despite some progress, it seems you still grapple with many unresolved feelings. It's entirely normal to feel this way, and I consider it a positive sign of your persistence and commitment to this process. Your dedication to thirty sessions is commendable and indicative of the trust and support you have placed in our work together.\n\nOne of the most striking impressions from our sessions was the sense of repression and helplessness you conveyed. It was as if rigid, unyielding forces were binding your thoughts, preventing you from relaxing and experiencing emotional freedom. This rigidity appears to have roots in your childhood, where memories are sparse and dominated by your father's authority—a figure you recall as being taciturn yet imposing. This perception of authority seems to have followed you into adulthood, manifesting in a conflicted relationship with power: both fearing it and harboring anger towards it.\n\nIn your professional environment, this dynamic seems to play out in complex ways. The hierarchical structure of your workplace echoes the oppressive authority of your childhood, leaving you feeling both intimidated and resentful. It seems that you often project this internal conflict onto your subordinates, seeking to reclaim some sense of power and control. However, this projection leads to further complications, as you find it challenging to address perceived disrespect or insubordination due to the intricacies of workplace relationships. This inability to effectively navigate these dynamics contributes to your psychological distress.\n\nYour interactions with authority during our sessions also reflected this ambivalence. At times, there was a palpable tension as you challenged the structure and procedures of our counseling process. This was, in part, an expression of your inner turmoil and resistance to authority, which I approached with understanding and flexibility. Our work involved adapting to the evolving circumstances of each session, addressing the current emotional landscape, and gradually alleviating negative feelings through reflection and insight.\n\nAs we delved deeper into your psychological landscape, it became apparent that your personality structure might involve borderline personality organization. This insight helped us understand the dichotomous thinking patterns you experience, where people and situations are perceived in extremes—either wholly good or entirely bad. Such polarization can hinder the integration of experiences, fostering rigidity in thought and behavior. Your perception of authority, for instance, illustrates this split: the need to respect authority above you, reminiscent of your father's influence, contrasts sharply with the expectation for subordinates to comply with your control.\n\nThis pattern of black-and-white thinking likely originated from early developmental stages and has become entrenched in your unconscious. Our work aims to bring these influences to the surface, allowing for greater awareness and integration. By revisiting these formative experiences, we hope to unlock the emotional knots that contribute to your current struggles. This process is not a quick fix but rather a journey towards deeper understanding and emotional liberation.\n\nI also sensed a palpable anxiety about the pace of our progress. You seemed to have a timeline in mind for resolving these issues, which has not aligned with reality, leading to frustration. It's important to recognize that the path to emotional healing and growth is often non-linear and requires patience and persistence. While immediate relief may sometimes be achieved through superficial solutions, lasting change requires a more profound engagement with your inner world.\n\nAn interesting aspect of our discussions was your reaction to certain cultural and societal norms, such as the promotional model of barber shops. These reactions reflect deeper feelings and beliefs that have clinical significance. They offer a window into how you relate to the world around you and provide opportunities for exploration and understanding.\n\nIn conclusion, our work together has highlighted the importance of exploring your early life experiences and the enduring impacts they have on your present circumstances. This exploration is crucial for unraveling the psychological patterns that contribute to your distress. In many parts of the world, including China, there is often a misunderstanding of the nature and goals of psychological counseling. This can lead to misconceptions and reluctance to persist in the therapeutic process. It's essential to recognize that psychological issues developed over decades cannot be resolved overnight. Successful outcomes depend significantly on your engagement and insight, with the counselor serving as a guide and support.\n\nI hope this expanded reflection provides a deeper understanding of our work and encourages further exploration of the themes we have discussed. Our journey together is one of discovery, requiring courage and commitment. I am here to support you every step of the way, and I look forward to continuing our work in uncovering the insights that will lead to meaningful change in your life.", "causes": "The harshness of her father's discipline during her childhood led to a psychological conflict of fear and anger toward authority.", "symptoms": "Anxiety, depression, insomnia, interpersonal tension.", "treatment_process": "Psychodynamic techniques: The counselor helps the client to explore early life experiences (the ambivalence of fear and anger towards authority triggered by the harsh discipline of the father in childhood) and their lasting impact on current interpersonal relationships, so as to change the extreme thinking patterns and deal with workplace relationships in a flexible way.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Traumatic childhood experiences lead to an attitude of fear and anger toward authority, which triggers tensions and conflicts in professional life, leading to anxiety and depression.", "treatment_effect": "Through psychodynamic techniques, the client explores his/her own psychological conflict between fear and anger towards authority, and then changes his/her thinking patterns to deal with workplace relationships flexibly."}

Visitor's Main Complaint: The visitor first experienced these symptoms when he was 17 years old in school. During class, a classmate sitting next to him was reading the text aloud very loudly, and it felt as if the classmate was intentionally trying to overpower his voice. The visitor suddenly fell into a state of discomfort: he experienced headaches and his mind was filled with chaotic thoughts, dominated by terrifying images of graveyards and coffins, which made him feel unbearable and led to suicidal thoughts. Later, his mother took him to see a local fortune teller. The fortune teller spoke about some ancestor of their family whose coffin had cracked, and other ghostly tales. Afterward, it was unclear what the fortune teller had him consume, but it seemed to help. After seeing the fortune teller and taking the \"elixir,\" his discomfort improved, and he was able to return to school and later enrolled in an undergraduate institution.", "In the later stages of his life, this situation occurred two or three more times: he recalled one instance while working in a squad, when a soldier about to be discharged said something to him, the exact content of which he could not remember, but it suddenly plunged him into a state of discomfort: nausea, hunger but no desire to eat, and poor sleep. Later, following his mother's previous advice, he consulted a fortune teller who told him that he had encountered a ghost and advised him to burn some paper money at a designated place for clarification. The visitor summarized that the previous times he fell into discomfort (depression) did not last long, with the longest being a month, and he managed to get through it by his own efforts, never having seen a doctor or taken medication. However, this time it was different; it had been two months with no improvement. The incident's trigger was that he had rented a new house to someone else, and later discovered that the person had renovated it and sublet it to others, which he found very unsatisfactory. He intended to reclaim the house under the pretext of viewing it and not renting to that person anymore. The individual replied, \"What are you looking at? It's already rented to someone else, and I don't have time right now because I'm at work!\" This statement plunged him back into a state of discomfort (depression). He had always hoped to pull himself out of this feeling through his own efforts, like the previous times, but it was getting worse, especially in the last few days when the symptoms intensified. A few days ago, he was only feeling uncomfortable but could still sleep. Recently, he not only experienced headaches and chaotic thoughts but also insomnia; on the day of the consultation, he woke up around 3 AM and hadn't felt sleepy by the time of the consultation. His physical symptoms included weakness, fatigue, frequent urination, fear and anxiety, and a tingling sensation in his body, making it truly unbearable, to the point that he seriously considered jumping from the building. Although he came for psychological counseling, he felt that it might not help him. In the past, he had always endured depression on his own, but this time he couldn't hold back and told his wife. Yesterday afternoon, his mother came from Tangshan to visit him and took him to see a fortune teller, but this time it was not only ineffective but also made things worse. His wife also took him to a traditional Chinese medicine doctor, who said he had autonomic ne", "4. Diagnosis or Assessment: Through the consultation with the client and according to the psychological assessment standards and principles of psychological counseling, it is determined that the client's depression is not significantly influenced by external triggers. The client also acknowledges that their condition is not closely related to what they have said to others. The primary factors appear to be physiological, such as endocrine abnormalities, which may be related to genetic factors and personality. However, this is just one possibility; psychological factors may also be involved, though they are not prominently reflected in this consultation.", "V. Effect of consultation or treatment:", "The visitor said the counseling effect was not very good, but talking to someone made him feel a bit better, reducing his discomfort level from 10 to 9, which was not a significant drop. Based on the visitor's actual situation, I suggested he seek treatment at a specialized hospital. Later, the visitor followed my advice and went to a local psychiatric hospital for treatment. After taking anti-anxiety and antidepressant medications, he experienced good results."], "experience_and_reflection": "Evaluation and Reflection on the Case:\n\nReflecting on the counseling objectives, this case underscored the limitations of psychological counseling in addressing severe depressive symptoms and intrusive thoughts related to the fear of death. Although the dialogue provided a temporary relief, it was evident that the discomfort and the psychological distress experienced by Hao You were deeply entrenched, possibly requiring more intensive therapeutic interventions beyond conversational techniques. This experience reinforced the critical understanding that psychological counseling, while beneficial, is not a panacea for all mental health issues, especially when physiological factors such as endocrine abnormalities might be at play. The successful referral to a psychiatric hospital and subsequent pharmacological treatment that yielded positive results speaks to the importance of recognizing when psychotherapy needs to be complemented by medical interventions. As therapists, we have the responsibility to offer mental health education, dispelling myths and promoting scientific understanding of mental health issues, which can be particularly challenging in cultures where traditional beliefs and practices, such as consulting fortune tellers, are prevalent.\n\nThe consultation process brought several insights into light. Firstly, the dynamics of the first-time online video consultation presented unique challenges and opportunities. Despite the poor audio quality, the visual cues provided valuable information about Hao You's demeanor, which was surprisingly more composed than typically observed in severe depression cases. This discrepancy highlighted the importance of holistic assessment, taking into account non-verbal cues, as well as cultural factors that might influence the presentation of symptoms. Hao You's repeated use of phrases like \"You might not believe it\" and \"Can you understand?\" during the consultation underscored a deep-seated need for validation and empathy, which are crucial elements in building a therapeutic alliance. The counselor's presence, trust, and acceptance become pivotal in helping clients feel understood and supported, especially when they are navigating through intense emotional pain.\n\nIn attempting to externalize Hao You's emotions, I aimed to help him name and differentiate his feelings, particularly anxiety and depression. While externalization seemed effective for anxiety, it was less successful for depression, which invites further exploration into the nature of these emotions. Anxiety, often linked with specific triggers, can sometimes be more amenable to externalization techniques, whereas depression, with its pervasive and amorphous nature, might require more nuanced approaches. The guiding attempt to engage Hao You in a dialogue with the coffin in his chaotic thoughts aimed at shifting his perception from fear to curiosity. However, this approach was met with limited success, possibly due to the intensity of his emotional state, which hindered rational engagement with the imagery. This leads to a critical reflection on the timing and pacing of interventions in therapy. Rushing into techniques without adequately preparing the client can lead to resistance or further distancing from the therapeutic process.\n\nThe reflection on Hao You's previous successful coping experiences, where he emphasized carrying on despite discomfort, offered a profound insight akin to the principles of Morita therapy. This approach encourages accepting the presence of discomfort while continuing with life's tasks, which might serve as a valuable strategy in managing obsessive thoughts and depressive tendencies. By probing into these experiences and enriching the narratives, the therapy can potentially strengthen the client's resilience and provide a foundation for future coping strategies.\n\nSupervisory questions emerged regarding the externalization process and the engagement with the client's painful emotions. The contrast in efficacy between externalizing anxiety and depression prompts an inquiry into the subtleties of these emotions and the client's readiness to confront them. Moreover, the attempt to guide Hao You to converse with the coffin imagery might have been premature, suggesting the need for a more gradual approach to exploring distressing thoughts. The case provides a learning opportunity to refine therapeutic strategies, ensuring they align with the client's emotional state and readiness for exploration.\n\nKey Situation Analysis: The incident involving Hao You's second aunt's passing and the vigil beside the coffin provides a significant context for understanding his fear of death and imagery involving coffins. His acknowledgment of not being afraid of coffins associated with relatives reveals a nuanced relationship with death, possibly influenced by cultural beliefs and personal experiences. This insight could be pivotal in exploring the underlying fears and beliefs that contribute to his intrusive thoughts and discomfort. Engaging in a culturally sensitive exploration of these experiences might offer a pathway to addressing his fear of death more effectively.\n\nIn conclusion, this case offers a rich tapestry of insights into the complex interplay between cultural beliefs, psychological distress, and therapeutic interventions. As practitioners, it is imperative to approach each case with an open mind and adaptability, recognizing the multifaceted nature of mental health issues and the need for a comprehensive, culturally informed, and client-centered approach.

This approach aims to change the seeker's irrational beliefs through pure theoretical analysis and logical reasoning, helping them address emotional and behavioral issues. This theory emphasizes that the source of emotions is the individual's thoughts and beliefs. Individuals can change their emotions by altering these factors and establish rational and correct beliefs, promoting the seeker's mental health and personality development.", "The specific method of muscle relaxation training involves first concentrating on each muscle group in the body, tensing the muscles while carefully feeling and maintaining that tension for 5 seconds.

Principle: The Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy, also known as the ABC theory, posits that A represents the activating event, B represents the individual's beliefs, interpretations, and evaluations of that event, and C represents the emotional responses and behavioral outcomes that follow. It is not the activating event that triggers changes in a person's emotions and behaviors, but rather the individual's interpretations and evaluations of the event. Those seeking help often use some irrational beliefs and perceptions that are discordant with reality to analyze and view things, which leads to self-induced anxiety. By changing these irrational beliefs, their attitudes and perceptions can be altered, thereby changing their negative emotions and behaviors. This enables the individual to correctly face certain setbacks in life, promoting harmonious development of both body and mind.", "The principle of muscle relaxation training is based on the fact that the relaxation of body muscles and emotional tension are two mutually restrictive states. At the same time, these two states cannot coexist in an individual. The emergence or strengthening of one state inevitably leads to the weakening or elimination of the other state.

As a clinician, it is imperative to recognize that while Xiao Wang's experience is unique, it also reflects broader societal and familial patterns that contribute to the psychological well-being of young individuals. In this expanded reflection, I will explore the intricate interplay of psychological, social, and familial factors that have shaped Xiao Wang's experiences, drawing on the rich details of the case to offer a comprehensive understanding of the underlying issues and potential therapeutic pathways.\n\nThe case of Xiao Wang underscores the significant impact of high parental expectations on a child's mental health. Despite the absence of explicit pressure from his mother, her actions implicitly conveyed an expectation for excellence, a common phenomenon in educationally driven families. This implicit pressure can often be more burdensome than overt demands, as it creates an environment where the child feels a constant need to meet perceived standards to gain approval. In Xiao Wang's situation, this was compounded by his mother's dual role as both a parent and a teacher at his school, which likely intensified his perception of needing to excel academically to maintain familial pride and honor.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, Xiao Wang's anxiety can be largely attributed to the internalization of irrational beliefs. The Rational Emotive Therapy (RET) approach was particularly relevant here, as it targets these maladaptive thought patterns directly. Xiao Wang's belief that his self-worth and future success were contingent upon his academic performance is a classic example of an irrational belief that RET aims to address. The therapy's focus on altering these beliefs through logical reasoning was crucial in helping Xiao Wang begin to dissociate his self-esteem from his exam results, thus reducing the anxiety associated with potential academic failure.\n\nAnother critical insight from this case is the role of perfectionism and the competitive spirit that often accompanies high-achieving students. Xiao Wang's pursuit of perfection, while a driving force behind his academic success, also became a source of significant stress. This duality of perfectionism—as both a motivator and a stressor—highlights the importance of helping young individuals develop a balanced perspective on achievement. Encouraging them to set realistic goals and to view setbacks as opportunities for growth, rather than as definitive failures, is essential in fostering resilience.\n\nThe consultation process revealed that Xiao Wang's anxiety was not only a product of internal cognitive distortions but also a response to external social pressures. The high expectations from teachers and classmates, coupled with his role as a class monitor, created an environment where he felt compelled to constantly prove his capabilities. This social dimension of anxiety is crucial, as it suggests that interventions should not only focus on the individual but also consider the broader social context. Educators and parents must collaborate to create supportive environments that prioritize holistic development over mere academic achievement.\n\nFurthermore, the consultation highlighted the significance of sleep disturbances as both a symptom and a contributor to Xiao Wang's anxiety. Poor sleep quality exacerbated his inability to concentrate and heightened his irritability, creating a vicious cycle that further impaired his academic performance. Addressing sleep hygiene, therefore, became an integral part of the therapeutic strategy. Teaching Xiao Wang relaxation techniques, such as progressive muscle relaxation, served to alleviate some of the physiological symptoms of anxiety, thereby improving his sleep and overall well-being.\n\nReflecting on the outcomes of the therapeutic process, it is evident that while significant progress was made in altering Xiao Wang's cognitive patterns and improving his emotional regulation, the persistence of some anxiety symptoms suggests that ongoing support may be necessary. This case exemplifies the notion that therapy is not a one-time intervention but rather a continuous journey towards mental wellness. It is crucial to empower young individuals with the tools and coping strategies they need to navigate future challenges independently.\n\nIn terms of clinical practice, this case reaffirms the importance of a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach to childhood anxiety. While cognitive-behavioral techniques are effective in addressing irrational beliefs, incorporating elements such as family counseling and psychoeducation for parents can enhance the overall therapeutic impact. Educating parents about the potential negative effects of excessive academic pressure and encouraging open communication can foster a more supportive home environment, thereby reducing the likelihood of anxiety manifesting in the first place.\n\nMoreover, this reflection emphasizes the need for early intervention. Recognizing the signs of anxiety in children and addressing them promptly can prevent the escalation of symptoms and the development of more severe psychological issues. Schools play a pivotal role in this regard, as they are often the first to notice changes in a student's behavior and performance. Training educators to identify and respond to signs of anxiety can facilitate early referrals to mental health professionals, ensuring that children receive the support they need at the right time.\n\nIn conclusion, Xiao Wang's case is a testament to the complexities of childhood anxiety in the context of academic achievement. It highlights the intricate interplay between individual cognitive processes and the broader social and familial environment. As clinicians, we must strive to understand these dynamics fully and to develop tailored interventions that address both the immediate symptoms and the underlying causes of anxiety. By doing so, we can help young individuals like Xiao Wang not only overcome their current challenges but also build a foundation for long-term mental health and well-being.", "causes": "Exam anxiety caused by the frustration of failing exams, high expectations of her mother, and her own perfectionist tendencies.", "symptoms": "Anxiety, insomnia, inability to concentrate in class.", "treatment_process": "Listening and empathy techniques: to make the visitor feel accepted and to alleviate painful emotions;\n Rational Emotive Therapy: Reduces anxiety due to potential academic failure by identifying and changing children's irrational beliefs about the absolutist association of tests with self-worth and future achievement;\n Muscle relaxation training: to improve sleep and reduce anxiety through relaxation training.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Children's perfectionistic demands for academic performance, high expectations from their mothers, and the need to face college entrance exams; internal and external pressures cause anxiety to escalate.", "treatment_effect": "Through rational-emotional therapy, the counselor helps the client to change the irrational belief that examination results are equal to self-worth, set realistic goals, and face the examination in a more peaceful state of mind to reduce anxiety."}

They are even more afraid of having to force themselves to adapt to another person after marriage. Second, they are afraid of the responsibilities and pressures that marriage brings. Today's young people have been cared for by their parents for a long time and mature psychologically late; once married, facing life alone and dealing with issues such as elderly parents, children, and property can create stress, leading to thoughts of escape. Third, with the increasing number of divorces, some men worry about potential problems after marriage and always feel that the timing is not right. Lastly, there is the possibility that men have been hurt in the past, such as experiencing parental discord or being abandoned.", "Third consultation", "The boyfriend set off, and only Xiaoya came for the consultation.

He seeks everlasting relationships, perfection, and believes that \"I must succeed,\" which are all idealistic desires. The boyfriend comes from a single-parent family, and \"I must succeed\" is a compensation demand from his mother for her failed marriage, which later subtly influenced and internalized into his personal creed. Pursuing perfection and striving for excellence are his keys to success, allowing him to achieve near perfection in his career, making his peers only able to look up to him. In marriage, pursuing \"I must succeed\" and having no room for failure can easily lead to anxiety, as marriage involves two people and is difficult to control, making pre-marital fear a reasonable concern.

The counselor and the help-seeker agreed to end the consultation, and during this sharing session, everyone expressed their psychological insights, creating a very harmonious atmosphere."], "experience_and_reflection": "\"I fear that my marriage will also be like theirs\" is a common saying among those who are afraid of marriage. This fear often roots itself in the deep-seated anxieties that arise from witnessing or experiencing tumultuous relationships during formative years. Such concerns are particularly poignant for individuals like Xiaoya's boyfriend, who grew up in a single-parent family marred by infidelity and divorce. His early experiences with family discord have undeniably shaped his perceptions of marriage, casting it in a shadow of instability and potential failure. In reflecting on this case, it's evident that these fears are not merely surface-level apprehensions but are embedded deeply in the psyche, influenced by childhood experiences and reinforced by societal narratives.\n\nThe fear of marriage, as observed in this case, is multifaceted. On one hand, it is driven by personal experiences and familial history, while on the other, it is exacerbated by societal portrayals of marriage that emphasize its challenges over its joys. Many individuals, like Xiaoya's boyfriend, are haunted by the idea that their marital relationship could mirror the negative patterns they observed in their parents or other close relationships. This fear is compounded by the societal \"propaganda\" that tends to highlight the difficulties and failures of marital life, creating a pervasive sense of insecurity about entering such a union.\n\nMoreover, some people desire to savor the sweetness of love without the accompanying responsibilities that marriage demands. This perspective is particularly prevalent among those who have not witnessed a harmonious marriage firsthand. The notion of marriage as a \"grave\" for love is a powerful metaphor that speaks to the perceived transition from the vibrancy of courtship to the mundane realities of married life. This transformation is often viewed with trepidation, as if marriage were a final destination rather than an ongoing journey of growth and partnership.\n\nIn the consultation process with Xiaoya and her boyfriend, it became apparent that his fear of marriage was not an isolated phenomenon but rather part of a broader pattern of perfectionism and idealism. His pursuit of an impeccable relationship reflects a deeper psychological need to compensate for the perceived failures of his parents' marriage. This idealism, while driving him to excel in his professional life, paradoxically inhibits his ability to engage fully in the messiness and unpredictability inherent in intimate relationships. The expectation that marriage must be perfect or not attempted at all can lead to a paralyzing fear of failure, making the prospect of commitment daunting.\n\nThe psychodrama sessions revealed the boyfriend's internal conflict between his desire for a stable, loving relationship and his fear of repeating his father's mistakes. His mother's demands for success, both personal and professional, have ingrained in him a belief that failure is unacceptable. This belief manifests in his relationships as an unrealistic expectation that marriage must be flawless to be worthwhile. The metaphor of choosing shoes that one will never tire of is particularly illustrative of this mindset—an ideal that is both alluring and unattainable.\n\nThe therapeutic journey with Xiaoya and her boyfriend highlighted the need for a shift in perspective. By engaging in exercises like the empty chair technique, they were able to explore their relational dynamics more deeply. This method facilitated a dialogue that allowed them to understand each other's fears and desires more clearly, moving beyond surface-level discussions to address the underlying psychological needs that their relationship met. It became clear that their dynamic often mirrored that of a sibling or parent-child relationship, with Xiaoya assuming a protective role that fulfilled her own need for significance and control.\n\nUnderstanding this dynamic was crucial for both of them to break free from the patterns that constrained their relationship. The exploration of the pros and cons of their current dynamic allowed them to see how it both served and hindered their growth as individuals and as a couple. The realization that their relationship was fulfilling certain psychological needs helped them to reevaluate their expectations and to consider how they might restructure their partnership to foster mutual growth and support.\n\nIn the final stages of consultation, the focus shifted to addressing the boyfriend's perfectionist tendencies directly. The use of metaphors, such as the comparison of marriage to wearing shoes, served as a powerful tool for reframing his beliefs about commitment and failure. The discussions around the inevitability of discomfort, whether from shoes or marriage, helped him to see that avoiding commitment altogether was not a viable solution to his fears. Instead, he began to understand that marriage, like any relationship, requires continuous effort, communication, and compromise.\n\nThe resolution of this case was marked by a significant transformation in both Xiaoya and her boyfriend. Through therapy, they developed a more nuanced understanding of marriage as a partnership that, while imperfect, offers opportunities for deep connection and shared growth. The decision to move forward with engagement was not made lightly but was the culmination of a journey through which they confronted their fears and redefined their expectations.\n\nReflecting on this case, it becomes clear that the fear of marriage is a complex interplay of personal history, societal influences, and psychological needs. For individuals like Xiaoya's boyfriend, overcoming this fear requires a deep exploration of the beliefs and experiences that have shaped their views on commitment. It also necessitates a willingness to embrace the uncertainties of marriage as opportunities for growth rather than threats to stability.\n\nIn conclusion, the therapeutic process with Xiaoya and her boyfriend underscores the importance of addressing the root causes of marital fears. By creating a safe space for exploration and dialogue, therapists can help individuals and couples to challenge their limiting beliefs and to envision a future that accommodates both their hopes and their fears. This case serves as a reminder that while marriage may be fraught with challenges, it also holds the potential for profound fulfillment and joy when approached with openness and resilience.", "causes": "Marital fear due to the turbulent family relationship caused by the father's early infidelity.", "symptoms": "Conflict between the fear of a stable, loving relationship and the fear of repeating the father's mistakes.", "treatment_process": "Listening and empathy techniques: allowing the visitor to feel accepted and explore their emotions;\n Psychodrama therapy: reveals the conflict between the boyfriend's inner fear of a stable, loving relationship and the fear of repeating his father's mistakes;\n Empty Chair Technique: exploring the underlying psychological needs of both partners through dialogue and transpersonal thinking, prompting them to reassess expectations and consider ways to restructure the marital relationship for mutual growth and support.", "characteristics_of_illness": "The boyfriend's early single-parent upbringing, perfectionist tendencies leading to a fear of marital failure that prevents him from getting married.", "treatment_effect": "Through psychodrama therapy and the empty chair technique, the counselor helps the client understand that marriage, like any relationship, requires continuous effort, communication and compromise, thus alleviating the fear of marriage."}

Consultation Process: The visitor suffered from a high fever due to influenza and developed sinusitis a few days ago. After resting at home for a week, they returned to school, feeling very anxious about falling behind in class. They are worried that teachers and classmates think they are not a good student and are very concerned about others' evaluations, which has led to several days of poor sleep. Recently, their anxiety has increased, and they often say their brain is not functioning properly; they used to understand the teacher's lectures but now find it difficult to comprehend. They also struggle to recall past events, feeling as if their mind is blank, unable to understand what others are saying or express what they want to say. Upon entering the consultation room, the visitor repeatedly expresses these thoughts. They describe themselves as selfish, stating that when they have academic problems, they would rather ask classmates than teachers. However, when classmates come to them with questions, they feel that helping them would take away from their own study time, so they are unwilling to assist, resulting in having almost no close friends in class.", "In life, there are basically no close friends, and sometimes I think that making friends would waste time that could be used for studying. The relationship with my mother is fairly good, while I communicate less with my father. Both parents care a lot about my academic performance; my father mainly talks to me about study-related issues. My mother’s concern for me can be described as meticulous; she never lets me handle any household chores and often says that as long as I study well, everything is fine. These actions from my parents make me feel that they are very focused on my academic results; even when my father glances at me a bit longer during meals, I feel that he is dissatisfied with my academic performance. All of this puts a lot of pressure on me. Getting into a top high school and then a prestigious university has almost become my only life goal, and it has also become my biggest source of stress. Deep down, I do not allow myself to perform poorly in my studies. If my grades drop or I fail to get into a local key high school, I cannot accept it; I feel that my life has no value. I lack a sense of security within myself, and doing well in my studies has become the only source of security and accomplishment for me, which may be where my problem lies. In my father's eyes, I am a girl who does not require parental concern for my life or studies, who is ambitious, has consistently excellent grades, and has a perfectionist personality.", "V.

While it's important not to exaggerate the child's issues to the visitor, I can honestly inform his parents to encourage them to persist with the consultation.", "7. Reflection on the Counseling Process: 1. During today's counseling session, I asked the client to choose a small puppet that resembled themselves and encouraged them to talk to the puppet. This approach proved to be quite effective; the client continuously stroked and hugged the puppet, even naming the little deer puppet \"Fawn.\" Although the client only silently looked at or gently touched the puppet without engaging in conversation, it still had a therapeutic effect. The client once said how happy these small puppets are, not having to think about anything. The client is very eager for a state where the mind doesn't have to think at all.", "In the above process, the visitor mentioned multiple times: even the most beautiful cloth dolls can be abandoned by their owners. When I suggested giving the doll to the visitor, they said, \"If you give her to me, isn't that abandoning her?\" Now I wonder how I should respond to her appropriately. For example, I might say, \"I don't know why you would have this concern.\" If you were the counselor, what would you do in this situation?", "When the visitor heard her father say that it didn't matter whether she got into a key high school or a key university, she suddenly cried, which indicates that these two points are very important to her.", "The visitor repeatedly said that he always wanted to cry but couldn't. When he cried, her father and I encouraged him to let out the problems in his heart. Perhaps deep down, he has a lot of repression and grievances that he has never properly expressed. Even the most basic and primal form of emotional expression, such as crying, has been blocked, preventing him from crying properly.", "5. After the visitor walked into the consultation room, they kept repeating that their mind was broken, that they couldn't remember anything from the past, that they couldn't understand what others were saying, and that they couldn't express what was on their mind. The visitor also continuously asked the counselor what the problem was. The answer was that there was no problem; I simply said that they were too tired and needed a break. In fact, the emergence of these symptoms is a form of self-protection mechanism within the body. The visitor once said how happy these little puppets are, as they don't have to think about anything. In reality, the visitor's current condition is caused by academic pressure; they are psychologically unable to bear this pressure, which has led to the formation of this protective mechanism in their subconscious to prevent further harm from academic stress."], "experience_and_reflection": "As I reflect on the consultation with Ma Xiaohua, a 15-year-old ninth-grade student grappling with severe anxiety induced by academic pressure, I find the experience rich with both challenges and insights that warrant deeper exploration. Initially, it is essential to acknowledge the significant immediate effect our single session had on Ma Xiaohua. By the conclusion of our two-and-a-half-hour interaction, she exhibited a marked shift in her emotional state, transitioning from a state of distress to one of visible relaxation, even expressing a readiness for sleep. This transformation underscores the power of therapeutic presence and the immediate impact that even a single session can have when it resonates with a client's pressing needs.\n\nReflecting on the session, the use of narrative therapy was pivotal. It allowed Ma Xiaohua to externalize her anxiety, framing it not as an inherent flaw within herself but as an external narrative influenced by her environment and experiences. This approach helped her begin to disentangle her identity from her academic performance, a crucial step in reducing the pressure she placed on herself. During our conversation, Ma Xiaohua was encouraged to articulate her internal dialogue, and through this narrative process, she revealed how deeply entwined her self-worth was with academic success. This insight was particularly poignant, as it highlighted the duality of her experience: on the one hand, the anxiety and fear of failure, and on the other, the desire for validation and security through achievement.\n\nThe therapeutic intervention involving the puppet—named \"Fawn\"—served as a symbolic tool for Ma Xiaohua. This technique, although seemingly simple, provided her with a medium to express unarticulated emotions and to project her feelings of vulnerability and abandonment onto an external object. The puppet became a safe conduit for emotions that were difficult for her to verbalize directly. Her interaction with \"Fawn\" suggested an underlying desire for care and unconditional acceptance, elements she perceived to be lacking in her human interactions, particularly concerning her academic performance.\n\nMa Xiaohua's reaction to her father's comment—that it did not matter whether she got into a key high school or university—was another significant moment. Her tears revealed the depth of her internalized pressure and the societal and familial expectations she felt compelled to meet. This incident offered a crucial therapeutic insight: Ma Xiaohua's emotional response indicated not just the importance of these academic milestones but also a yearning for her father's genuine understanding and acceptance, irrespective of her academic achievements. It highlighted a critical aspect of her anxiety: the need for parental validation, which was intertwined with her academic identity.\n\nFrom a clinical perspective, it is essential to understand the systemic nature of Ma Xiaohua's anxiety. Her family's well-meaning but intense focus on her academic success has inadvertently contributed to her stress. Her father's seemingly benign gestures, such as prolonged gazes during meals, were perceived as judgments on her academic standing, illustrating how deeply ingrained this academic narrative was within the family dynamic. Her mother's meticulous care, while intended to provide support, further reinforced the notion that academic success was her primary value. This familial context necessitates a systemic approach in therapy, addressing not only Ma Xiaohua's individual experiences but also the broader family dynamics contributing to her anxiety.\n\nThe initial recommendation for Ma Xiaohua's parents to refrain from discussing academic issues and to engage in more recreational activities with her was a strategic move to create a supportive environment conducive to healing. This advice was grounded in the understanding that changing the immediate environment and incorporating physical activity can help shift cognitive patterns and alleviate anxiety. By encouraging Ma Xiaohua to step away from the academic pressures momentarily, we aimed to provide her with an opportunity to experience herself outside the confines of her academic identity.\n\nIn contemplating the consultation's long-term potential, the challenge lies in transforming this initial crisis intervention into a sustainable therapeutic journey. The fleeting nature of the session, compounded by the family's decision not to pursue further consultations, raises critical questions about the continuity of care. How can we as clinicians encourage families to see the value in ongoing therapeutic support, especially when initial improvements might suggest that the crisis has been averted? In Ma Xiaohua's case, it is vital to communicate the importance of addressing the root causes of her anxiety, rather than merely alleviating the symptoms temporarily.\n\nMoreover, Ma Xiaohua's perception of herself as a perfectionist who struggles with interpersonal relationships provides another layer of complexity to her therapeutic needs. Her self-described selfishness in academic settings and her reluctance to form friendships point to a deeper issue of self-esteem and self-worth. These aspects should be addressed through continued narrative therapy, helping her reconstruct her self-image in a way that values her for more than just academic success.\n\nThe session also revealed Ma Xiaohua's internalized belief that emotional expression, such as crying, is a weakness. This belief has likely contributed to her emotional bottling and repression, a pattern that narrative therapy can help dismantle by providing a safe space for emotional exploration and validation. Encouraging Ma Xiaohua to embrace her emotions and view them as natural and essential parts of her human experience will be crucial in her journey towards emotional resilience.\n\nIn conclusion, Ma Xiaohua's case is a compelling example of the intricate interplay between individual psychology and familial and societal expectations. It highlights the necessity for a holistic therapeutic approach that considers not only the individual's symptoms but also the broader context in which these symptoms manifest. As clinicians, our role extends beyond immediate crisis management to fostering an environment where clients and their families can engage in meaningful, long-term therapeutic work. In Ma Xiaohua's case, this involves nurturing her sense of self beyond academic achievements and empowering her to build fulfilling relationships and a robust self-esteem that is resilient to external pressures.", "causes": "Learning anxiety due to high parental expectations, own perfectionist tendencies, and falling behind in school after taking time off for illness.", "symptoms": "Anxiety, boredom with school, insomnia, decreased comprehension and cognitive functioning.", "treatment_process": "Listening and empathy techniques: make the visitor feel accepted and understood;\n Narrative therapy: externalizes anxiety, seeing it not as an internal flaw but as an external narrative influenced by circumstances and experiences.

Driven by the treatment goals of improving overall functioning and well-being, binge eating behavior was a primary focus of the therapy. Although the treatment process followed a standardized structure of ACT therapy (emphasizing the improvement of daily functioning and behavioral activation; accepting internal experiences and emotions with an open mindset), the content and pace of the treatment segments were adjusted according to individual circumstances to best accommodate the patients.", "The focus of the first treatment session is on the psychological health background of ACT therapy and establishing a good therapeutic relationship. In this session, the therapist introduces the process, concepts, and principles of ACT therapy, as using ACT to treat BED may differ from the patient's expectations. More specifically, before the treatment begins, the patient emphasizes addressing their perceived issues (such as binge eating, emotionally triggering events, and other negative emotions). The approach of ACT therapy is not to directly eliminate negative emotions or binge eating behaviors but to set effective living and meaningful action as therapeutic goals, discussing binge eating behaviors and negative emotions in the context of achieving a high-quality life.", "For example, when patients emphasize addressing binge eating and the negative emotions that trigger it, the therapist gently asks them why they believe binge eating and these negative emotions are the core issues. The therapist then explains that these are seen as problems partly because they interfere with the individual's daily life. Once the individual recognizes the connection between their current issues and social functioning (friendship, work, and study), the therapist can suggest making efficient living and effective action a therapeutic goal.", "Therapist: ...So, let me summarize your point... You believe that binge eating and the negative emotions that trigger it are the main issues, and you would like to focus on addressing these problems.", "Patient: I'm not sure if I can completely get rid of these issues, but this is the main treatment goal I hope to achieve.", "Therapist: Have you thought about what is causing your binge eating and negative emotions?", "Patient: [Looks a bit confused] I don't want to binge eat, and I don't want to have emotions. I mean, I shouldn't have binge eating behaviors.", "Therapist: [brief pause]. I guess it could be said that you believe they are the source of the problem because they have significantly interfered with your daily life. They hinder you from becoming the person you want to be and doing the things you want to do. Their existence has caused you to miss out on many important things.", "Patient: Well, it's like this. [Visitor nods].", "Therapist: We often think that in order to improve quality of life, we first need to address these issues. However, perhaps we can start to enhance quality of life even before resolving these problems... What ways can we take to restore social functioning and improve quality of life, even in the presence of these symptoms? I know you want to control the symptoms that are bothering you. But the issue is, the more you try to control certain things, the more they can spiral out of control. [Most patients always hope for a complete cure of their symptoms before starting a new life. The therapeutic approach of ACT teaches patients to take effective action guided by values, even in the presence of symptoms, despite potential pain and discomfort.]", "Change of Perspective: Treatment Sessions 2-4 Summary", "Although patients believe that binge eating symptoms are the main issue, they may not necessarily understand the maintaining factors of these symptoms and how they affect daily activities.", "The first step of ACT is to assess whether the patient engages in these pathological behaviors to alleviate negative emotions (such as anger, frustration, and loneliness). Once this is confirmed, the second step is mental health education, helping the patient recognize the relationship between binge eating and negative emotions (negative emotions trigger binge eating, the binge eating process temporarily manages and alleviates negative emotions, and guilt and self-blame arise after binge eating, leading to a vicious cycle). In terms of treatment, researchers have found that when patients fully understand the functional connection between negative emotions and binge eating, it can help them realize that trying to reduce, suppress, or drive away negative emotions is ineffective. Therapists use metaphors to help patients better understand that attempting to control negative emotions often exacerbates negative experiences rather than alleviating them. It is like being stuck in a swamp; the more one struggles to escape, the deeper one sinks.", "Therapist: In fact, we all engage in similar behaviors. Watching TV, drinking, traveling, distracting ourselves or numbing ourselves, etc., may temporarily alleviate stress, but the more we engage in these behaviors, the more we become dependent on them. However, these actions do not lead to significant improvement; negative emotions still persist, and we may even experience some form of guilt or regret. Thus, this behavior intended to help relieve stress becomes another source of pressure. Once you experience negative emotions, trying to eliminate or chase them away is, as countless experiences show, ineffective.", "Patient: I can actually understand this behavior. If \"binge eating\" is my way of coping with negative emotions, I might need to learn to let go of binge eating and think of other solutions, but \"negative emotions\" are just too frightening.", "Therapist: It is indeed difficult for us to give up \"binge eating,\" as it seems to be an effective tool for you to cope with stress or negative emotions.", "Patient: Well, whenever I felt overwhelmed by studying or relationships in the past, I always tended to binge eat.", "Therapist: Can we try not to rely on it and explore other ways to cope with negative emotions?", "Patient: [pauses for a long time] Yes, I don't necessarily have to rely on it.", "Both patients believe that binge eating is a strategy they use to distract themselves or avoid negative emotions. In addition to not completely eliminating negative thoughts and feelings, binge eating also leads to feelings of guilt, shame, sadness, self-loathing, and frustration after the binge."], "experience_and_reflection": "Throughout the course of treatment, we observed significant and meaningful progress in both patients, marked by a notable reduction in the frequency of binge eating episodes. This improvement was not only observed during the active treatment phase but also maintained during the follow-up period, reflecting the enduring impact of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in addressing binge eating disorder (BED). The therapeutic journey was rich with insights, underscoring the complexity of BED and the importance of a nuanced approach to treatment.\n\nAt the outset of the therapy, both patients exhibited an average of 5.7 binge eating episodes per week, a frequency that was markedly reduced to 2.0 episodes by the end of the treatment phase. During the follow-up, this frequency further decreased to 1.3 episodes per week. This reduction is particularly noteworthy in Patient 1, who showed such significant improvement that she no longer met the diagnostic criteria for BED by the conclusion of the treatment and maintained this status during follow-up. These quantitative outcomes are indicative of the qualitative changes observed in the patients' relationship with food and their emotional responses.\n\nFrom a clinical perspective, the success of this intervention can be attributed to several key factors intrinsic to ACT. First and foremost is the emphasis on psychological flexibility, which was a central component of our therapeutic strategy. Psychological flexibility refers to the ability to fully contact the present moment and the thoughts and feelings it contains without unnecessary defense, while persisting in behavior that serves one's values. This was particularly relevant in treating BED, where rigid control and avoidance of negative emotions often exacerbate the condition. Through ACT, patients learned to embrace their emotions and thoughts without judgment and to commit to actions that were aligned with their personal values, even in the presence of challenging internal experiences.\n\nThe structured process of self-monitoring played a critical role in facilitating this flexibility. By regularly documenting their binge eating behavior and reflecting on the circumstances surrounding each episode, patients gained increased awareness of their triggers and patterns. This self-awareness was further enhanced by the weekly completion of the Body Image Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (BI-AAQ). The BI-AAQ provided valuable insights into the patients' progress in terms of body image flexibility, which is a crucial aspect of recovery from BED. The initial average score of 34.5 at the start of treatment rose to 46.7 during the intervention and settled at 43.0 during follow-up, demonstrating a sustained improvement in how patients perceived and responded to their body image.\n\nA pivotal aspect of the treatment was addressing distorted cognitions related to eating, as measured by the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q). These cognitive distortions often involve rigid beliefs about weight, self-worth, and the approval of others, which can drive binge eating behaviors. By exploring these beliefs within the safe and supportive context of therapy, patients were able to challenge and reframe them, leading to more adaptive thinking patterns.\n\nEmotional eating, assessed using the Emotional Eating Scale (EES), was another significant focus of the treatment. Patients rated the extent to which their eating behaviors were influenced by emotions such as anger, loneliness, and irritability. The scores indicated a high level of emotional eating at the start of treatment, which gradually decreased as patients learned alternative coping strategies for managing their emotions. This shift was facilitated by ACT's emphasis on acceptance and mindfulness, which encouraged patients to experience their emotions without resorting to binge eating as a means of avoidance.\n\nIn reflecting on the individual therapy sessions, the initial phase was crucial in establishing a strong therapeutic alliance and setting realistic treatment goals. The introduction to ACT concepts was particularly important, as it required a shift in mindset for patients who initially focused on eliminating binge eating and negative emotions as primary goals. Instead, therapy emphasized the pursuit of a meaningful and value-driven life, even in the presence of these symptoms. This paradigm shift was challenging for patients but ultimately empowering, as it allowed them to focus on enhancing their quality of life without being hindered by the need for symptom elimination.\n\nAs therapy progressed into sessions two through four, we concentrated on helping patients understand the functional relationship between negative emotions and binge eating. This understanding was crucial in breaking the vicious cycle of emotion-triggered eating followed by guilt and self-blame. By using metaphors and experiential exercises, patients were able to see the futility of attempting to control or eliminate negative emotions and instead began to explore alternative ways to manage them.\n\nThe latter stages of therapy focused on consolidating these insights and reinforcing the patients' commitment to living in accordance with their values. We worked on developing practical strategies for coping with stress and negative emotions that did not involve binge eating. This included mindfulness practices, value clarification exercises, and identifying and engaging in activities that were intrinsically rewarding and aligned with the patients' values.\n\nThroughout the treatment process, it became increasingly apparent that binge eating served as a maladaptive coping mechanism for managing emotional distress. By addressing the underlying emotional and cognitive factors, rather than merely the behavioral symptoms, we facilitated a deeper and more sustainable recovery process. Both patients expressed a newfound sense of empowerment and agency over their lives, recognizing that while they could not control all external circumstances or internal experiences, they could control their responses and actions.\n\nIn conclusion, the application of ACT in treating BED proved to be highly effective in this case. The improvements observed in binge eating frequency, body image flexibility, and emotional regulation are testament to the power of psychological flexibility as a therapeutic target. This case underscores the importance of addressing the cognitive and emotional dimensions of eating disorders and highlights the potential for ACT to facilitate meaningful and lasting change. As clinicians, we are reminded of the value of a holistic and patient-centered approach, which not only addresses symptoms but also fosters resilience and personal growth.", "causes": "Overeating behavior triggered by negative emotions.", "symptoms": "Binge eating behavior, guilt, shame, self-loathing, and frustration.", "treatment_process": "Listening and Empathy Technique (LET): to make the visitor feel accepted and understood;\n Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT): fully accepting the present moment and the thoughts and feelings it contains without unnecessary defenses, while adhering to behaviors that are consistent with personal values.

After multiple communications and in-depth understanding, it was discovered that the main reason is the deep impact of suppressive and negative education from their original family, leading to some irrational cognitions. Additionally, long-term difficulties in studying, living, and working have resulted in prolonged emotional accumulation. After about six months of continuous systematic counseling, using methods such as cognitive behavioral therapy, psychoanalysis, rational emotive therapy, and situational simulation therapy, the visitor was guided to correctly recognize their emotions, reasonably handle people and events related to emotions in their life and work, and learn some operational methods for emotional management. Gradually, the visitor achieved growth, felt a sense of welcome and value, and was able to stabilize and appropriately manage their emotions, engaging in work and life with a new outlook."], "experience_and_reflection": "Emotional turmoil can be likened to an intricate dance between past experiences and present stimuli, where the rhythms are often dictated by the echoes of childhood. Through the lens of our visitor's journey, we see the profound impact of early emotional conditioning, revealing how unresolved childhood experiences can shape one's emotional landscape, casting long shadows into adulthood. Our visitor's struggle is emblematic of a broader truth: when emotions become overwhelming, cognitive functions such as judgment, thinking, and behavioral control can suffer greatly. These moments of emotional upheaval often lead to significant errors, both minor and major, in personal and professional spheres.\n\nThe concept of the \"emotional infant\" is crucial in understanding the impulsive and sometimes destructive reactions that individuals may exhibit when triggered. An \"emotional infant\" explodes at the slightest provocation, allowing their emotions to govern their actions with a sense of immediacy that disregards future consequences. This state not only affects the individual but also reverberates through their social environment, causing distress and dysfunction.\n\nSelf-awareness is the cornerstone of emotional management. Identifying the origins of one's emotions is akin to tracing the roots of a tree—only by understanding where these emotional triggers originate can we begin to address them effectively. While many assume that current events are the primary triggers of emotions, the reality is that these are often linked to past experiences. Our cognition, shaped by our experiences, gives birth to our emotions.\n\nThe limbic system, the emotional center of the brain, matures around the age of seven, forming an emotional framework based on early experiences. A child who feels consistently safe and loved will likely develop a brain inclined towards exploration and positivity. Conversely, a child who frequently feels fear and unease may grow to distrust new experiences, leading to heightened sensitivity to discomfort.\n\nAt the heart of many negative emotions such as anger, grievance, and repression lies the oppressive education received from one's original family. When a child is persistently criticized or denied, similar stimuli in adulthood can activate these deep-seated emotional circuits, resulting in adverse emotional responses. However, individuals who experienced nurturing and affirmation during their upbringing often handle denial and suppression with resilience, viewing them as mundane rather than painful.\n\nIn moments of stress, the emotional processing system takes precedence over rational thought, which explains the lapses in control that can occur during emotional crises. Paying attention to our emotions reveals that many are neither the fault of the individual nor the result of external provocation, but rather manifestations of the emotional \"seeds\" planted in childhood. While most emotions are rooted in these early experiences, some can also stem from significant events in adulthood.\n\nA case in point involves a visitor who is deeply disturbed by loud voices, believing them to be deliberate provocations. This stems from childhood experiences with loud and rough parental communication, which ingrained \"loudness\" as an emotional trigger. The key to managing such emotional responses lies in reflection: understanding the roots of these emotions can significantly alleviate the distress they cause, as recognition shifts the perception from personal failure or external targeting to a logical consequence of past conditioning.\n\nA common misconception is the notion of \"controlling emotions.\" True emotional management is not about control but understanding and integration. Attempts to suppress emotions or avoid trauma can lead to exacerbation rather than resolution, akin to inflamed wounds that worsen without proper treatment. The more emotions accumulate unaddressed, the greater the potential for breakdown.\n\nAs \"The Body Keeps the Score\" suggests, healing begins with owning our emotional brain—observing and tolerating the intense feelings associated with trauma or shame. It involves listening to our bodies' internal states and facing the unresolved wounds, allowing for the possibility of genuine healing through recognition, confrontation, and alleviation of emotional pain points.\n\nProactive steps to reshape emotional beliefs are essential. Recognizing one's emotional characteristics and providing appropriate reminders can prevent emotional triggers from leading to impulsive reactions. When faced with situations that provoke strong emotions, pausing to analyze whether an emotional or rational response is more appropriate can offer a buffer to manage these feelings effectively.\n\nCreating calm space away from emotional triggers allows for temporary emotional cooling, though it does not address the deeper needs. Trusted friends and family can provide support during emotional intensification, offering understanding and companionship that can prevent further harm and facilitate emotional release.\n\nThe ABC method for emotional management, inspired by Adler's teachings, emphasizes the transformation of external stimuli through internal cognition. By addressing the root causes of our emotions and reshaping beliefs, we can rebuild positive emotional circuits, activating brain areas that control positive emotions and fostering new experiences that promote emotional mastery.\n\nTrue healing is a continuous process of learning and growth through life practice. Engaging with wise individuals and exploring broader perspectives can expand our understanding, allowing us to overcome emotional obstacles and establish a flow of positive beliefs. This journey requires persistence, introspection, and a willingness to embrace new experiences that enrich our emotional lives. Through this ongoing endeavor, we can achieve a state of emotional equilibrium that allows us to navigate the complexities of life with resilience and grace.", "causes": "Difficulty in trusting others due to introverted and repressed personality, interpersonal tension, triggering depression.", "symptoms": "Depression, irritability, and frequent arguments and conflicts with others.", "treatment_process": "Listening and empathy techniques: make the visitor feel accepted and understood;\n Cognitive-behavioral therapy: guides visitors to correctly identify their own emotions, change irrational beliefs, reasonably deal with interpersonal relationships and events related to emotions in their lives, and master some operational methods of emotion management.", "characteristics_of_illness": "The visitor is introverted, used to suppress emotions, and when facing stressful events, emotions override reason, resulting in impulsive behavior.", "treatment_effect": "Through the treatment, the counselor helped the visitor to realize growth, feel accepted and valued, and be able to stabilize and appropriately manage her emotions, and devote herself to her work and life with a new perspective."}

At 27 years old, she is a middle school teacher. She has two older brothers, but due to her parents' work and other reasons, they were fostered by their grandmother since childhood. Only she seems to be the sole daughter, carefully looked after by her parents. Smart, lively, and petite, Xiao A was a \"little star\" in kindergarten, able to sing and dance, earning praise from all the teachers; at home, she is her mother's \"little treasure,\" often receiving verbal praise along with delicious snacks and fun toys. As she grew up, Xiao A continued to be the \"excellent student\" at school and her mother's \"obedient daughter.\"", "Xiao A can be said to have achieved success and had a smooth journey in her childhood. However, the only thing that puzzles and frustrates her is why her father, who truly holds power in the family, has always been indifferent towards her. Whether she won first place in the kindergarten singing and dancing competition or achieved excellent results as the top student in the arts in the entire county to enter a national key university, her father always maintained a calm and indifferent expression, showing none of the pride that often appeared on her mother's face. Despite her attempts to earn a word of praise from her father through her successes, even just a look of appreciation, Xiao A was left utterly disappointed.", "Her repeated successes and \"firsts\" not only failed to bring a smile to her father's face but instead made her feel increasingly perplexed, uneasy, and inferior. Her father's silence seemed to convey doubt about her, making her feel that her \"firsts\" were not the result of her talent and effort, but rather the result of some luck or deceit.", "As her countless \"first\" certificates turned yellow, her father's calm face became increasingly wrinkled, seemingly more cold and ruthless. Whether it was graduating from university to become a teacher or getting married and becoming a mother, Xiao A still couldn't experience the joy she should have felt from her repeated successes. On the contrary, all she felt was the memory of her father's mountain-like cold and silent face, which left her with an indescribable sense of oppression and inferiority amidst her repeated confusion and anxiety. In Xiao A's mind, her father's calm face weighed down on her like a mountain; she resented him and even found him \"truly detestable,\" yet felt powerless to resist.", "In the eyes of ordinary people, Xiao A is an admirable and enviable standout; whether in her career or personal life, she can be considered a success. However, she always lacks the experience of true success, which has even led to a completely opposite emotion. It is precisely this reason that drives Xiao A to work tirelessly and strive relentlessly. Although she lives in a state of exhaustion, confusion, and pain, she cannot help but rush forward, as if her existence is solely for the endless pursuit of being \"first\" and achieving \"excellence.\" As for why she feels this way, even she cannot explain it clearly.", "What should we do?

Her father's indifference instilled a sense of inferiority in her, like a damp, sticky black cloth tightly enveloping her. Her mother's approval and encouragement gave her confidence. However, beneath that confidence lay a deep-seated inferiority. Her inherently sensitive soul could not form a unified personality: the superficial consciousness of self-esteem, self-improvement, and self-confidence clashed with the inner feelings of anxiety, confusion, and inferiority, creating an irreconcilable contradiction. She couldn't explain herself and could only rely on endless struggles and pursuits to suppress and drive away the contradictory thoughts that intruded upon her consciousness. Yet, each act of self-suppression left her feeling drained and powerless, while also making her feel that the lurking \"enemy\" was nearly unbeatable. She couldn't help but doubt that success was only partial and temporary. The anxiety, confusion, and inferiority would always return, like a flood, consuming the brilliance of her entire life. Thus, she instinctively felt a nightmarish \"sense of crisis,\" acutely aware of her fragility and insignificance.", "Although various successes could not free her from this \"nightmare,\" the busyness and torment of struggle could somewhat calm her inner unease and fear. The social recognition and praise that success brought could also somewhat fill the deep, dark ditches of her inferiority, allowing her to find a moment of peace and satisfaction.", "Little A's lack of a sense of success is mainly due to her childhood family environment and incorrect attribution. I decided to use hypnosis to help her regain her confidence. Hypnosis is particularly suitable in psychological counseling for those with psychological obstacles caused by childhood experiences. Through a series of counseling experiences, Little A regained her true sense of success and finally experienced an \"authentic confidence and joy.\"", "In the first stage, the main goal is to prompt Xiao A to recall in as much detail as possible the reasons for her sense of lack of success, allowing her to fully express the repressed, gloomy, and resentful emotions she has been harboring, thereby helping to adjust her internal psychological balance while providing appropriate sympathy and encouragement as positive and optimistic psychological suggestions. For example: \"The way your father treated you, although well-intentioned, must have felt quite unfair to you. Fortunately, you have grown up now and understand that a person's worth is mainly judged by how others perceive them, rather than based on the attitude and opinions of any single individual. Now, your leaders and colleagues praise your excellent work, and your students respect and love you. You also have a happy little family that others envy. You have every reason to feel confident and joyful. If you reflect on this, you will find that you feel very confident and joyful right now, won't you?\" Xiao A nodded happily, indicating that she had experienced the confidence and joy that come from success. After several such suggestions, Xiao A was able to smoothly accept these positive viewpoints. In a deep hypnotic state, Xiao A became joyful, confident, and optimistic, as if the sticky black cloth shrouding her heart had been lifted, revealing her true, lively, and natural self. Before concluding each hypnosis session, she was given psychological suggestions to maintain the post-hypnotic effects and taught self-hypnosis techniques such as relaxation meditation to practice at home.", "After the first stage, Xiao A felt a sense of relief. In the second stage, on one hand, we continued to provide Xiao A with positive encouragement to help her build self-confidence; on the other hand, we tried to leverage the post-hypnotic effect as much as possible, helping Xiao A extend the correct understanding and positive experiences gained during hypnosis into her waking reality. This way, she could gradually experience the joy and happiness of success, and in the next hypnosis session, we made every effort to reinforce this newly blossomed experience, encouraging her brain to form a reflex mechanism of \"success → confidence → happiness.\"", "After the formal completion of the second phase, Xiao A felt much more confident. I have followed up for a year, and the results are stable with no relapses.", "It is worth mentioning that for over a year, Xiao A has been consistently practicing relaxation meditation training. She finally told me, \"Relaxation meditation training not only helped me eliminate psychological barriers, but also strengthened my creative thinking ability, often bringing me many beneficial inspirations.\""], "experience_and_reflection": "William James astutely noted, \"The deepest need of human nature is the desire for the approval of others.\" This notion of approval, akin to the nurturing rays of sunlight, plays a pivotal role in shaping the emotional landscape of an individual. In its absence, the heart remains enshrouded in shadows. This case of Xiao A highlights this poignant truth, illustrating the intricate dynamics of approval, self-worth, and the quest for personal fulfillment.\n\nXiao A's journey, from her formative years to adulthood, is marked by a persistent lack of self-confidence despite her manifold achievements. At first glance, she epitomizes the ideal—endowed with beauty, intelligence, and a successful career as a middle school teacher. Yet beneath this facade lies a profound insecurity, a void left unfilled by her father's elusive approval. This dichotomy between external success and internal turmoil offers a rich ground for exploration and reflection, shedding light on the complex interplay of familial relationships and personal identity.\n\nThe genesis of Xiao A's struggle can be traced back to her childhood, a period characterized by maternal adoration juxtaposed against paternal indifference. Her mother, ever supportive, showered her with praise and affection, fostering a sense of self-worth. However, her father's cold demeanor cast a long shadow over her accomplishments, breeding doubt and a gnawing sense of inadequacy. Despite her stellar performances, his indifference conveyed a silent skepticism, undermining her achievements and instilling a belief that her successes were merely fortuitous rather than merited.\n\nIn her narrative, Xiao A reveals the bittersweet emotions tied to her father's unyielding silence—a silence that spoke volumes, leaving her feeling unworthy of the pride she desperately sought. The absence of paternal validation became a source of profound distress, affecting her perception of self and her ability to experience genuine joy from her accomplishments. It is this unmet need for approval that became the catalyst for her relentless pursuit of excellence, driving her into a cycle of exhaustion and dissatisfaction.\n\nFrom a clinical perspective, Xiao A's case exemplifies the impact of childhood experiences on adult psychological well-being. Her father's indifference functioned as a psychological barrier, preventing her from internalizing her successes and developing a cohesive sense of self-worth. The discrepancy between her outward achievements and internal self-perception underscores a deeper conflict within her psyche—a conflict rooted in the inability to reconcile her innate capabilities with the perceived lack of validation from a pivotal figure in her life.\n\nThe use of hypnotherapy in Xiao A's treatment serves as a powerful intervention, offering her the opportunity to revisit and reinterpret her childhood experiences. Through guided hypnosis, Xiao A was able to access suppressed emotions, articulating the resentment and confusion that had been lingering beneath the surface. This process of recalling and narrating her experiences allowed her to confront the underlying feelings of inferiority, facilitating a rebalancing of her internal emotional state.\n\nIn therapy, the exploration of Xiao A's familial dynamics revealed the dual forces shaping her self-perception: her mother's encouragement provided a foundation for confidence, while her father's indifference sowed seeds of self-doubt. This dichotomy led to a fragmented sense of self, with her conscious drive for self-improvement clashing against the subconscious feelings of inadequacy. The role of the therapist was to guide Xiao A through this maze of contradictions, helping her to integrate these disparate elements into a coherent self-concept.\n\nThe therapeutic journey involved not only revisiting past events but also reframing her narrative to foster a more balanced understanding of her worth. By examining the impact of her father's behavior through a compassionate lens, Xiao A was able to shift her perspective, recognizing that her value transcends the opinion of any single individual. This reframing process was crucial in dismantling the psychological constructs that had been hindering her ability to experience authentic joy and confidence.\n\nFurthermore, the introduction of positive psychological suggestions during hypnosis provided Xiao A with new cognitive frameworks to counteract her ingrained beliefs of inadequacy. These suggestions emphasized her achievements and the respect she garnered from her peers, encouraging her to view her successes as reflections of her capabilities rather than fortuitous occurrences. The transformation witnessed in Xiao A was profound; as the sessions progressed, she began to embrace a newfound sense of confidence and optimism, shedding the oppressive weight of her father's indifference.\n\nThe integration of self-hypnosis techniques, such as relaxation meditation, played a pivotal role in sustaining the therapeutic gains achieved through formal sessions. By engaging in regular practice, Xiao A was able to reinforce the positive cognitive and emotional changes initiated during therapy, cultivating a resilient sense of self-worth that extended into her daily life. This ongoing practice not only fortified her confidence but also enhanced her creative thinking, providing her with new avenues for personal growth and fulfillment.\n\nReflecting on Xiao A's case, it becomes evident that the approval of others, particularly parental figures, exerts a profound influence on one's self-concept and emotional well-being. Her journey underscores the necessity for individuals to seek validation from within, nurturing their intrinsic sense of worth independent of external affirmation. The therapeutic process facilitated this shift, empowering Xiao A to assert, \"I am excellent, I am confident, I am happy,\" with conviction—a testament to her resilience and the transformative power of psychological counseling.\n\nIn closing, Xiao A's case serves as a poignant reminder of the intricate relationship between childhood experiences and adult self-perception. It highlights the critical role of therapeutic interventions in unraveling and reconstructing one's narrative, fostering healing and growth. Her story is a testament to the capacity for change, illustrating how, through introspection and guided support, individuals can transcend the shadows of their past and embrace their true potential.", "causes": "The visitor's father's indifference to the visitor's achievements during childhood led to a lack of true success.", "symptoms": "The superficial pursuit of self-esteem, self-improvement and self-confidence conflicts with the deep-seated anxiety, confusion and low self-esteem, forming an irreconcilable contradiction.", "treatment_process": "Listening and empathy techniques: make the visitor feel accepted and understood;\n Hypnotherapy: through intentional dialog, guiding the visitor to fully express the long-suppressed feelings of depression and resentment, thus helping to adjust the inner psychological balance, and helping to form a sense of self-worth through positive suggestion.", "characteristics_of_illness": "The father's indifference acted as a psychological barrier that prevented the client from internalizing success and developing a complete sense of self-worth.", "treatment_effect": "Through hypnotherapy, the counselor helped the client to release her repressed emotions and express her long-lurking resentment and confusion, so that she could face her inner inferiority complex, thus promoting the rebalancing of her internal emotional state and engaging in her work and life with a new perspective."}

After achieving certain therapeutic effects, clients often choose to discontinue treatment.

The initial presentation of the client was marked by severe insomnia, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, with a profound impact on her daily functioning and mental health. This highlighted the urgent need for a comprehensive and flexible therapeutic approach.\n\n1. **Adaptation and Responsiveness in Treatment Scheduling:**\n   At the outset, the client had not slept for six consecutive days, presenting in a state of acute distress. Recognizing the severity of her condition, I opted for a more intensive treatment schedule with daily consultations. This departure from the conventional three-day interval approach was crucial. It allowed us to quickly establish rapport, maintain therapeutic momentum, and provide consistent support during her most vulnerable periods. This flexible approach demonstrated the importance of adapting treatment plans to meet the immediate needs of clients, particularly in acute cases where symptoms are debilitating and require prompt intervention.\n\n2. **The Efficacy of Hypnotherapy and Integrative Therapeutic Modalities:**\n   The primary use of hypnotherapy, complemented by cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), narrative therapy, and psychoanalytic techniques, proved to be significantly more effective than relying on a single therapeutic modality. Hypnotherapy facilitated deep relaxation, helping the client to access and process subconscious emotions and thoughts that contributed to her anxiety and insomnia. The integrative approach allowed for a tailored treatment plan that addressed not only the symptomatic relief but also the underlying cognitive and emotional patterns contributing to her distress. This case reinforces the value of a multimodal approach, where different therapeutic techniques are harmonized to cater to the unique complexities of each client's psychological landscape.\n\n3. **The Importance of a Trusting Therapeutic Relationship:**\n   Building a sincere and trusting consulting relationship was paramount. From the first session, efforts were made to create a safe, non-judgmental space where the client felt heard and understood. This foundational trust enabled the client to openly explore her fears, vulnerabilities, and experiences, which is crucial in achieving meaningful therapeutic progress. The relationship was not just a vessel for delivering therapy but a therapeutic tool in itself, fostering a sense of safety and empowerment that catalyzed her healing process.\n\n4. **Beyond Symptom Relief: Fostering Self-Confidence and Social Reintegration:**\n   While initial consultations focused on alleviating acute symptoms, such as insomnia and anxiety, it became clear that long-term recovery required addressing deeper issues of self-identity and self-worth. Through narrative therapy and mindfulness techniques, the client was guided to explore her past experiences, current beliefs, and future aspirations. This journey was instrumental in rebuilding her self-confidence and establishing a renewed sense of self. Encouraging the client to set realistic life goals and reintegrate into her social and professional environments was essential in sustaining the therapeutic gains and preventing relapse.\n\n5. **The Role of Psychoeducation and Empowerment:**\n   Throughout the therapeutic process, psychoeducation played a vital role in demystifying her symptoms and reducing the stigma associated with her mental health challenges. Educating the client about the nature of neurasthenia and the mind-body connection helped her to understand her condition, thus reducing anxiety about her symptoms. Empowering the client with self-help strategies, such as mindfulness and self-hypnosis, equipped her with tools to manage her mental health independently, fostering a sense of agency and resilience.\n\n6. **Reflective Practice and Continuous Learning:**\n   This case underscored the importance of reflective practice as a clinician. Regularly reviewing the progress and setbacks of the client allowed for timely adjustments in the treatment plan and informed future consultations. The complexity of the client's condition and the dynamic nature of her responses to different therapies highlighted the need for ongoing learning and adaptation in clinical practice. As a practitioner, being open to new insights and willing to evolve one's therapeutic approach is crucial in delivering effective mental health care.\n\n7. **Conclusion and Future Directions:**\n   Although the consultation goals were not fully achieved, significant progress was made, particularly in improving the client's sleep and emotional stability. The decision to conclude therapy was client-driven, a common scenario where initial therapeutic goals have been met, and the client feels prepared to resume life with newfound skills and insights. The ultimate measure of success in psychotherapy is the client's ability to reintegrate into their social and professional spheres, equipped with the resilience and strategies to navigate future challenges. This case highlights the intricate balance between therapeutic intervention and the client's autonomy in their healing journey.\n\nIn sum, this case has provided rich insights into the complexities of treating neurasthenia with comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms. The lessons learned underscore the importance of a holistic, client-centered approach that is responsive to the unique needs and circumstances of each individual, paving the way for more effective and compassionate mental health care.", "causes": "Anxiety and depression due to a specific stressful event (relationship with a fisherman).", "symptoms": "Severe insomnia, anxiety and depressive symptoms, inability to socialize and work normally.", "treatment_process": "Listening and empathy techniques: to make the visitor feel accepted and understood;\n Hypnotherapy: through intentional dialog, guiding the visitor to discover his/her loneliness, self-denial, and to communicate the problem with his/her partner;\n Cognitive behavioral therapy: to change irrational cognition;\n Narrative therapy: reconstructing life stories and rebuilding self-confidence.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Neurasthenia with symptoms of anxiety and depression.", "treatment_effect": "Through holistic treatment, the visitor's sleep quality has improved significantly, and she is now able to sleep more than six hours, maintain a regular routine and general emotional stability."}
{"id": 141, "case_description": ["Visitor Xiaomei, female, 28 years old, architect. Every time she falls in love, Xiaomei goes bankrupt once. The pattern of each relationship is the same; initially, the man actively pursues her, willing to pay for their dates and spend money on her. However, Xiaomei feels this gives off a \"materialistic\" impression, and she fears being looked down upon by men. In subsequent dates, she rushes to pay the bill before the man and buys him various expensive gifts. In this way, the interaction pattern gradually flips; she always positions herself as the one who is fully invested in the relationship, believing that if she gives her all, the man will love her twice as much. Yet, ultimately, every man leaves her without hesitation."], "consultation_process": ["Consultation request: Why do I give so much, yet no man is willing to marry me? I need an answer. If love comes again, how can I keep it? Consultation process: First stage: Identify the problem relationship pattern. When Xiao Mei found me, she was troubled by depression and desperately asked me, “Why do I give so much but still can’t find a man willing to marry me? I’m already 28, my youth is gone, my career hasn’t progressed, and I’ve spent all my money on men. Is there anyone more of a failure than me in this world?” After taking on her negative emotions, she briefly described her four failed relationships—In her first relationship, after graduating from middle school, she went out to work, not only covering her younger siblings' school fees but also paying for her first boyfriend's college expenses. When her boyfriend finally got a job, he embraced another girl and told her, “We aren’t suitable.” In her second relationship, she was with a married man for three years; he was poor and had a bad temper. During those three years, she spent all her salary on him, buying him nice clothes, shoes, and even expensive lighters, while her own clothes were cheap items from Taobao. In the end, the man didn’t return to his wife but left with another woman, claiming it was because she was too controlling. In the third relationship, the man enjoyed food and travel, and she spent all her money on these activities. When he renovated his house, she went into debt to cover all the renovation costs, only to find that she wasn’t the bride when he got married. The man’s reason was that living with her made him feel like he had eyes on his back. In the fourth relationship, the man was a scammer who deceived her of all her savings and even encouraged her to overdraw her credit to borrow money for his so-called career. Even so, he would disappear from her sight for days, not responding to messages or calls, and when he returned, it inevitably led to fights. Six months later, he completely vanished from her life. Everyone told her he was a scammer, but she didn’t believe it because she only trusted her own feelings. Despite their fights, he had shown her tenderness, care, and love—how could he be a scammer? She spent a whole year looking for a man until the truth came out; he was taken to court by another woman who had been scammed like her, and that’s when she woke up from her dream. Xiao Mei had an obsession: she believed the reason men left her was fate. She said it was possible that in a past life, she owed those men emotional and financial debts, and in this life, she had to repay them. After collecting Xiao Mei’s four emotional experiences, I guided her to realize that her giving to men was aimed at control; she hoped that men would listen to her and take responsibility for her emotions because of what she gave. Her four relationships actually repeated a pattern: she could give her all, but men had to act entirely according to her will. If things didn’t go her way, she would complain, blame, and criticize, driving men to label her as having a “bad temper” and eventually leave her. I pointed out to Xiao Mei that this pattern was what limited her, and she admitted that she was aware of it and hated that side of herself, but once in love, she would unconsciously repeat this pattern. Second stage: Subconscious connection. In this stage, we deeply explored Xiao Mei’s interaction pattern with her mother. She said her mother was hardworking and giving, but very domineering, with a strong desire for control, and was quite strict in her discipline. Growing up, she had to be responsible for her mother’s emotions, her health, and even the family’s luck—her family ran a small business, and starting from age eight, she was responsible for the household cleaning, washing everyone’s dirty clothes, cooking dinner, and taking care of her younger siblings. When business was good, her parents neglected her; when it was bad, her mother would come home and scold her as a “bad luck charm,” claiming she had “swept away” all the family’s good fortune… This was her fate, feeling like a “superman” from a young age, an unappreciated “superman.” As she grew up and got involved with men, she also felt she had to take responsibility for them, including their food, daily needs, and finances; she needed to replicate her “superman” image. Of course, the psychological motive behind this giving was control, with the purpose being, “I’ve given you so much, you need to listen to me and be responsible for my emotions.” This was the intimacy relationship template she internalized from her family. Therefore, this “superman” who gave her all in relationships was also unappreciated. I guided Xiao Mei to understand that her four previous relationships were not debts from a past life that needed to be repaid in this life; rather, they were a forced repetition of her intimacy relationship pattern—this was a subconscious connection. Third stage: Break free from past limitations and regain love. Xiao Mei’s fifth relationship was guided by me, and she did not invest money as she did in the first four relationships but received an engagement ring from the man instead. When she got married, she sent me a message saying, “Teacher, you once said I have the charm to make a man fall in love, but I lacked the ability to manage intimate relationships, and I felt a bit resentful about that. Because at that time, I thought intimate relationships didn’t need to be managed… Thank you for helping me develop the ability to manage intimate relationships.”"], "experience_and_reflection": "In relationship counseling, individuals like Xiaomei often grapple with deeply ingrained patterns of behavior that stem from their familial backgrounds, particularly the influence of a strong, controlling mother figure. Such dynamics are not uncommon in clients who find themselves repeating detrimental patterns in their intimate relationships. This reflection delves into the complexities of these patterns and how they manifest in adult relationships, offering a comprehensive analysis based on Xiaomei's case.\n\nXiaomei's experience reveals a classic cycle where love is equated with giving and control, a template likely forged during her upbringing. Her mother, a figure of both love and control, instilled in her a belief that love requires sacrifice and servitude. This belief is not unique to Xiaomei but is a common thread among many who seek counseling for similar issues. These individuals grow up internalizing the notion that they must earn love through complete devotion, often at the expense of their own needs and desires. In Xiaomei's case, this manifested in her relationships as a compulsive need to give financially and emotionally, under the misguided belief that such sacrifices would secure her partner's love and commitment.\n\nThe psychological underpinnings of such behavior can be traced back to the child's role in the family dynamic. For Xiaomei, taking on adult responsibilities at a young age, such as caring for her siblings and contributing to the household, reinforced her perception that love and acceptance are contingent upon her ability to fulfill the needs and expectations of others. This role, deeply ingrained in her psyche, became the lens through which she viewed all her relationships. It is a powerful example of how early family experiences can shape our understanding of love and our behavior in intimate relationships.\n\nIn therapy, the first step is often helping the client recognize these patterns and understand their origins. With Xiaomei, this involved exploring her family history and identifying the parallels between her interactions with her mother and her behavior in romantic relationships. This process is crucial as it helps clients see that their current struggles are not simply due to bad luck or fate, as Xiaomei initially believed, but are rooted in long-standing psychological patterns.\n\nOnce these patterns are identified, the next step is to challenge and reframe them. For Xiaomei, this meant understanding that her worth was not tied to how much she could give or how well she could control a situation. This required a significant shift in her self-perception and a reevaluation of what she truly wanted from a relationship. It also involved acknowledging that love is a mutual exchange rather than a transactional arrangement where one party gives and the other receives.\n\nThe therapeutic journey often involves addressing the fear of vulnerability that underlies these patterns. For someone like Xiaomei, who has been conditioned to equate love with giving, the idea of receiving love without strings attached can be both liberating and terrifying. Therapy provides a safe space to explore these fears and to practice being vulnerable in a controlled environment. This is crucial for breaking the cycle of over-giving and for developing healthier, more balanced relationships.\n\nMoreover, therapy helps clients like Xiaomei develop better communication skills and set healthy boundaries. Many clients struggle with the idea that setting boundaries will drive their partner away, yet in reality, boundaries are essential for maintaining a healthy relationship. They help ensure that both partners' needs are met and that the relationship is built on mutual respect and understanding. In Xiaomei's case, learning to set boundaries was a key factor in her eventual success in forming a stable and fulfilling relationship.\n\nAnother important aspect of therapy is helping clients understand the concept of emotional regulation. For someone who is used to controlling every aspect of their environment, learning to manage their emotions without resorting to control can be challenging. Techniques such as mindfulness and cognitive restructuring can be invaluable in helping clients gain control over their emotional responses and reduce the impulse to control their partner.\n\nReflecting on Xiaomei's journey, it's clear that the path to breaking free from these deeply ingrained patterns is neither easy nor quick. It requires a willingness to confront uncomfortable truths and to take responsibility for one's actions. It also requires a commitment to personal growth and a desire to create a more fulfilling life. For Xiaomei, the turning point came when she realized that her happiness did not depend on another person but on her own ability to love and accept herself.\n\nThrough therapy, Xiaomei learned to appreciate her own value and to approach relationships from a place of abundance rather than scarcity. She came to understand that true love is not about control or sacrifice but about partnership and mutual support. This realization allowed her to open her heart to a new kind of relationship, one where she could give without losing herself in the process.\n\nIn conclusion, Xiaomei's case illustrates the profound impact that early family dynamics can have on adult relationships. It highlights the importance of addressing these patterns in therapy and the transformative power of self-awareness and personal growth. For those who find themselves trapped in similar cycles, Xiaomei's story offers hope and a reminder that change is possible with the right guidance and support.

Narrative therapy is a postmodern psychotherapeutic approach that has received widespread attention. It breaks away from the traditional view of treating people as problems and employs methods such as \"storytelling,\" \"externalizing problems,\" and \"from thin to thick\" to empower individuals and enhance their motivation. It helps clients identify overlooked fragments to evoke their inner strength for change. Simply put, narrative means telling stories, which in the context of consultation involves bringing forth the positive elements that have once been present in the client's life to increase their internal energy for change."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on this profoundly challenging case, I am struck by the complex interplay of trauma, resilience, and the quest for healing that defines the visitor's narrative. As I delve deeper into the nuances of the visitor's story, I am reminded of the transformative potential embedded within the narrative therapy framework—a methodology uniquely poised to reframe and empower those who have endured profound adversity.\n\nThe visitor’s narrative is a tapestry of pain, betrayal, and a desperate search for love and acceptance, woven from early childhood into young adulthood. This journey began with the harrowing experiences of abuse at the hands of a trusted family member, the grandmother, who should have been a source of safety and nurturance. Instead, the grandmother’s actions, marked by physical abuse and the dark secret of infidelity, left indelible scars on the visitor’s psyche. These early experiences of betrayal and harm were compounded by the subsequent discovery of the mother’s infidelity, further eroding the visitor's already fragile trust in familial relationships.\n\nIn exploring the visitor's story, it is evident that these formative experiences of abuse and neglect have profoundly shaped their internal narrative, fostering a deep-seated belief in their unworthiness and an expectation of betrayal from those who should offer love and support. This expectation has manifested in a self-destructive cycle of self-harm and a pervasive sense of isolation, as the visitor struggles to reconcile their longing for connection with the fear and distrust instilled by their early life experiences.\n\nNarrative therapy invites us to consider these experiences not as defining features of the individual’s identity but as externalized problems that can be addressed and reframed. By shifting the focus from internal pathology to the broader sociocultural context in which these experiences occurred, we can begin to dismantle the visitor’s internalized narrative of shame and guilt. This reframing process is essential in helping the visitor recognize the external origins of their pain and the potential for change within their story.\n\nAs I consider the metaphor of the little tree striving to grow amidst the rubble, I am reminded of the resilience inherent in the visitor’s journey. Despite the overwhelming challenges they have faced, there remains a persistent, albeit bent, will to survive and seek a semblance of light amidst the darkness. This resilience is a testament to the visitor’s enduring strength and serves as a foundation upon which to build a more empowering narrative.\n\nIn reflecting on the metaphor, it becomes clear that the visitor's current state of despair and hopelessness is not an endpoint but rather a point of transition. The bent nature of the tree, while indicative of past trials, also represents the unique trajectory of growth that the visitor has undertaken. It is crucial to acknowledge that the visitor’s experiences, though painful, have equipped them with a depth of insight and emotional complexity that can be harnessed in their journey toward healing.\n\nThe narrative therapy process involves identifying and amplifying the moments of strength and resistance that have been overshadowed by the dominant narrative of pain. In the visitor’s story, these moments are evident in their persistent pursuit of academic excellence despite the lack of familial support and the brief periods of self-awareness and introspection that have punctuated their journey. These instances of agency and resilience, though fleeting, provide critical entry points for therapeutic exploration and the reconstruction of a more hopeful and empowered narrative.\n\nThrough the narrative therapy lens, we can also explore the broader sociocultural factors that have influenced the visitor’s experiences and perceptions. The family dynamics, characterized by secrecy, infidelity, and emotional neglect, reflect systemic issues that extend beyond the individual. By situating the visitor’s story within this broader context, we can begin to challenge the internalized belief that their suffering is a reflection of personal failure or inadequacy.\n\nAs the visitor navigates the complex emotions of anger, hatred, and despair, it is important to recognize these feelings as legitimate responses to their past traumas rather than pathological states to be eradicated. Narrative therapy encourages the exploration of these emotions as part of the visitor’s story, providing a space for their expression and validation. By externalizing these emotions, the visitor can begin to disentangle their identity from the pain they have experienced, creating room for new narratives to emerge.\n\nIn the process of rewriting their story, the visitor is invited to consider alternative narratives that acknowledge their pain while also celebrating their resilience and capacity for growth. This involves identifying the values and aspirations that have been suppressed by the dominant narrative of despair and exploring how these can be integrated into a more cohesive and empowering personal narrative.\n\nThe metaphor of the water lily, which blooms brilliantly despite its origins in the mud, offers a powerful symbol of hope and transformation for the visitor. It serves as a reminder that, even in the most challenging circumstances, there is potential for growth and renewal. By embracing this metaphor, the visitor can begin to reimagine their future, not as a continuation of past suffering, but as an opportunity for healing and self-discovery.\n\nIn our ongoing work together, the focus will be on nurturing the visitor’s sense of agency and possibility, helping them to envision a future in which they are not defined by their past but empowered by the lessons and strengths they have gained. This involves cultivating a sense of self-compassion and forgiveness, recognizing that their journey, though marked by pain, has also equipped them with unique insights and strengths that can guide them toward a more fulfilling and meaningful life.\n\nAs we continue to explore the visitor’s narrative, the goal is to support them in developing a more nuanced and integrated sense of self, one that acknowledges the complexity of their experiences and celebrates their resilience and potential for growth. By engaging in this process, the visitor can begin to reclaim their story, transforming it from one of despair and hopelessness to one of empowerment and possibility.\n\nIn conclusion, this case highlights the profound impact of early trauma on an individual’s narrative and the transformative potential of narrative therapy in facilitating healing and growth.

Help Seeker's Self-Reported Issues  \nExperiencing anxiety and depression, feeling distressed and irritable, experiencing pain, headaches, and stomach aches.  \n\nSecond Consultation (Duration: 1.5 hours)  \nEffect of Last Consultation: The help seeker changed into a new set of clothes, dressed neatly, was able to look the counselor in the eye, though the gaze was brief, and blinked continuously. His face was flushed, and his demeanor was restrained. He completed his homework very seriously, writing about 5,000 words of psychological reflections. He reflected on his issues well, combining his insights with the counselor's analysis and judgment. The help seeker described: He strongly agrees with the counselor's analysis of the root of his psychological issues and has great confidence in psychological counseling and therapy. His feelings of anxiety and depression have improved significantly. The headache has noticeably lessened. The feeling of bloating and pain in his stomach has also decreased. By the third day, he eagerly wanted to come for the next counseling session. Time Interval Since Last Consultation: One week.  \n\nThird Consultation (Duration: 1.5 hours)  \nEffect of Last Consultation: The help seeker wore the same clothes as during the first consultation but looked neater and more appropriate. His hair was styled with gel, and he appeared lively and bright. Upon entering, he called the teacher and immediately reported the effects of the last consultation without waiting to be asked. The help seeker described: The results are excellent. It can be described as immediate effect. After returning to school, his tension around females has decreased significantly; he still feels a bit nervous around women and occasionally thinks about having sexual relations with them, but soon forgets it. He is now able to look at women nearby with confidence. This week, he greeted and spoke to twenty-three familiar females, totaling sixty-one interactions. Most of their reactions were natural and friendly, engaging with him. There were about three or four who ignored him, but since he was prepared, he didn't feel anything was abnormal. Afterward, he thought that they seemed to have something on their minds and were not emotionally responsive to him. There were even more boys, definitely over thirty, but he didn't count.

The frequency of blinking approached normal. His face was slightly flushed. The help seeker said: \"Teacher, look, my blinking problem has improved a lot. My dorm mates think I'm very strange; I seem like a different person. They all ask how I suddenly changed from a silent person to a bright and charming one. I know they are joking, but I am still very happy. Thank you, Teacher Han. I really appreciate you! I want to give you a hug.\" I stood up to accept his hug. The other two assistants in the counseling room also accepted his hugs one by one. The help seeker reported on the small travel group he organized. He invited seven people, including three girls, and they visited the Huangdi Mausoleum in Xinzheng. Later, two people left, and the remaining five played poker for a long time and cooked together. He said he had never been this happy before. Everyone praised his organizational skills. He was very pleased. I said, \"Come on, everyone, let's hug and congratulate you!\" Time Interval Since Last Consultation: One week.  \n\nFifth Consultation (Duration: 1 hour)  \nEffect of Last Consultation: The help seeker wore a new red shirt with white stripes, radiating energy and youthful vitality. He told me he bought it with money earned from working on weekends. He felt a sense of liberation and rebirth. The help seeker worked as a promoter for a photography studio on weekends. The studio owner offers such compensation: five dimes for bringing in a single person and two yuan for bringing in a couple. In the first week, he earned forty-eight yuan on the first day and forty-five yuan on the second day; in the second week, he earned thirty-nine yuan on the first day and fifty-three yuan on the second day. He earned the most among all the promoters. He never expected to be so capable, saying, \"I feel like I am a capable person; I am really great.\" Time Interval Since Last Consultation: Two weeks."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on the transformative journey of the help seeker, Xiao Li, from a state of severe anxiety and depression to a vibrant and engaged individual provides a profound understanding of the intricate interplay between psychological distress and personal growth. This case highlights the potential of psychotherapy to catalyze change and underscores the importance of a comprehensive, empathetic approach tailored to the unique experiences and needs of the individual.\n\nInitially, Xiao Li presented with symptoms indicative of deep-seated psychological distress, including pervasive thoughts and fears related to interactions with women and men alike. His self-perception was marred by feelings of filthiness and moral corruption, exacerbating his anxiety and depression. These intrusive thoughts and feelings not only affected his interpersonal relationships but also impaired his academic performance and overall quality of life. The case exemplified how unaddressed psychological issues could manifest in physical symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, and stomach pain, further complicating his ability to function effectively in daily life.\n\nThe therapeutic approach adopted for Xiao Li was multifaceted, integrating System Desensitization Therapy and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). These techniques were pivotal in helping Xiao Li confront and gradually desensitize his fears, enabling him to reshape his cognitive patterns and behavioral responses. System Desensitization Therapy allowed Xiao Li to incrementally face his anxieties in a controlled and supportive environment, reducing the automatic fear response that had previously overwhelmed him. Simultaneously, CBT provided a framework for Xiao Li to identify and challenge the distorted beliefs fueling his anxiety and depression, facilitating the development of healthier cognitive patterns.\n\nA critical aspect of the therapeutic process was fostering Xiao Li's self-awareness and self-acceptance. Through guided introspection and reflective exercises, Xiao Li was encouraged to explore the origins and nature of his intrusive thoughts. This exploration revealed a complex interplay between cultural, familial, and personal factors that had shaped his self-perception and world view. Understanding these underlying dynamics was essential for Xiao Li to dissociate his self-worth from his intrusive thoughts and to begin cultivating a more positive self-image.\n\nThe role of cultural and familial influences in Xiao Li's psychological distress cannot be understated. Growing up in a family with modest means and traditional values, Xiao Li internalized certain expectations regarding behavior and morality. These expectations contributed to his feelings of inadequacy and shame when faced with intrusive sexual thoughts, which he perceived as transgressions against his moral code. The therapeutic journey involved unpacking these deeply ingrained beliefs and examining how they contributed to his self-condemnation and avoidance behaviors.\n\nThe progression of Xiao Li's therapy sessions reflected significant milestones in his recovery journey. Notably, the changes in his demeanor and self-presentation during consultations illustrated the tangible impact of therapy on his confidence and self-esteem. His ability to make eye contact, engage in social interactions, and take pride in his achievements signaled a newfound sense of agency and self-efficacy. These developments were not merely cosmetic; they represented a fundamental shift in Xiao Li's internal narrative and emotional resilience.\n\nAn integral component of Xiao Li's growth was the establishment of a supportive social network. Encouraged to participate in social activities and form meaningful connections, Xiao Li gradually expanded his circle of interactions beyond the confines of therapy. This process was instrumental in rebuilding his social confidence and provided opportunities for positive reinforcement and validation from peers. The group outing he organized and the success he found in his part-time job exemplified his growing social competence and leadership skills, further reinforcing his self-worth and sense of belonging.\n\nThe concept of natural hedonism introduced during therapy played a vital role in redefining Xiao Li's approach to life. Emphasizing the pursuit of genuine happiness and fulfillment within the natural development laws, this philosophy encouraged Xiao Li to embrace life's joys and challenges with an attitude of curiosity and openness. It provided a framework for Xiao Li to navigate his personal and professional life, aligning his actions with his values and aspirations.\n\nThrough this therapeutic journey, Xiao Li developed a comprehensive understanding of his life system, integrating insights from various levels—cosmic, natural, biological, societal, and individual. This holistic perspective empowered him to approach life with clear goals, principles, and boundaries, fostering a sense of control and purpose. As Xiao Li learned to balance the demands of academic, social, and personal spheres, he demonstrated remarkable resilience and adaptability.\n\nThe follow-up over three years revealed Xiao Li's ability to self-regulate and adapt to life's challenges. Although he occasionally encountered depressive episodes triggered by external stressors, his enhanced coping mechanisms enabled him to manage these episodes effectively. The absence of recurring suicidal tendencies underscored the lasting impact of therapy on his emotional well-being and highlighted the importance of ongoing self-reflection and growth.\n\nIn conclusion, Xiao Li's case underscores the transformative potential of psychotherapy when tailored to the individual's needs and context. His journey from debilitating anxiety and self-loathing to empowerment and self-acceptance illustrates the profound impact of understanding, support, and strategic intervention. As clinicians, we are reminded of the importance of viewing each client as a unique individual, deserving of a nuanced and compassionate approach that honors their experiences and aspirations. Through such personalized care, we can facilitate meaningful and lasting change, enabling individuals like Xiao Li to lead lives marked by dignity, joy, and fulfillment.", "causes": "Self-loathing and depressive tendencies due to conflict between sexual fantasies about women and moral constraints.", "symptoms": "Severe anxiety and depression as well as somatization symptoms such as headaches and stomach pains, and inability to socialize.", "treatment_process": "Listening and empathy techniques: to make the visitor feel accepted and understood, and to explore her self-emotions safely;\n Systematic Desensitization Therapy: enabled Li to gradually face his anxiety in a controlled and supportive environment, reducing the automatic fear response that had previously overwhelmed him.\n Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: provided Lee with a framework to help him identify and challenge distorted beliefs that contribute to anxiety and depression facilitating the formation of healthier cognitive patterns.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Li's self-perception was distorted by feelings of defilement and moral turpitude, further exacerbating anxiety and depression.", "treatment_effect": "As a result of the treatment, the client was able to gradually expose himself to normal interactions with the opposite sex, which he had feared, and was able to meet people eye-to-eye, engage in social interactions, and take pride in his accomplishments, indicating a new sense of autonomy and self-efficacy."}

However, \"he has been very dishonest since childhood. In elementary school, he once broke his arm and often got into fights, almost being confronted by someone every day. When others brought their children to confront me, my father would get very angry and beat me, so I was almost beaten every day, but I still didn't change. I never submitted to anyone since I was a child and was very bold.\"", "\"When I got to middle school, my studies were still good, but I still couldn't change my bad habits and often had conflicts with teachers. Once, I had a fight with the principal, and he wouldn't let me attend school. Later, my father apologized to the principal, and after many twists and turns, I barely managed to return to school.\"", "After getting into high school in this life, his bad habits still did not change. Within a week of entering high school, he teamed up with two others to fight with older students, which was dealt with severely by the school, and he received a serious warning. However, not long after, he collaborated with others to severely injure another classmate, causing him to be hospitalized for two months and incurring significant medical expenses, leading to his expulsion from school. After various efforts and writing a guarantee letter, he returned to school two months later.", "\"After returning to school, I began to follow the rules I set for myself diligently and was very cautious in my actions. In the first few days, aside from greeting my classmates, I said nothing else. Even when I was with them, I didn’t speak as I used to, only making superficial conversation. My classmates said I had changed a lot. After a few days, I felt quite uncomfortable with this situation and gradually started to talk more, but I was still very careful about my words and actions. Sometimes, when I got a bit too rowdy with other classmates, I worried about offending someone and began to suspect things randomly. When I noticed someone looking at me differently or their facial expressions changing slightly while talking to me, I felt very anxious. I also paid close attention to the expressions of my teachers when they saw me, and if I noticed anything unusual, I would overthink it. At the same time, I was very concerned about the teachers' and classmates' opinions and evaluations of me. If I had a little disagreement with a classmate, I feared they would speak ill of me behind my back, so I tried hard to maintain good relationships with all my classmates. However, I still couldn't shake off some of my bad habits, such as wanting to show that I was better than others in certain situations. Furthermore, since that incident, the villagers' perception of me had changed, so I was very careful after returning to school, feeling that if I were expelled again and sent home, I wouldn't be able to stay in the village at all. Consequently, I thought through everything I did, reconsidering each small task after completing it, wondering if I had done it right.\"", "\"Later on, especially during exams, I started to feel anxious. If I saw a small crack on the pencil tip, I would tape it up with transparent tape. Although it didn't affect my writing, I always felt uncomfortable and couldn't stop thinking about it. I knew in my mind that it was nothing to worry about, but I kept thinking about it, which made me very restless and affected my performance in exams. Eventually, during exams, if I occasionally felt that the soles of my shoes were uneven or my belt was a bit tight, I would feel very uncomfortable and couldn't help but think about it. I tried not to think about it, but the more I tried not to, the more I did. In reality, the soles of my shoes were perfectly flat and my belt wasn't tight at all. From then on, I also found it hard to concentrate in class, which affected my ability to study properly. Eventually, it developed to the point where I would also fixate on little stains or loose threads on my clothes. This problem lasted for almost a year.\"", "\"Later, I began to dislike others for being dirty and felt that things were dirty. I was always afraid that someone would transmit some disease to me. Once, when my pen accidentally fell on the ground, I thought that perhaps someone had spat there or stepped on it with their shoes, so I felt it was very dirty. After touching the pen, I didn't dare to touch anything else. Another time, a classmate had surgery. I knew that the disease was not contagious at all, but I was still very worried. Sometimes, when this classmate accidentally touched me, I would get very anxious and would wipe the spot on my clothes several times before feeling at ease.\"", "\"Later on, I started to overthink issues that shouldn't be a concern in my studies. For example, regarding the statement that 3 is 1/2 of 6 and that 3 is 1/2 times 6, I found myself doubting it. I knew they meant the same thing, yet I still had my doubts and sought out various materials to confirm. This endless cycle of doubt left me feeling dizzy and quite uncomfortable. Even when shopping, I often worried about making calculation mistakes.\""], "consultation_process": ["The typical characteristics of obsessive-compulsive disorder are the coexistence of conscious self-compulsion and conscious self-anti-compulsion, and the conflict between the two causes significant distress for the patient. From the situation reflected by the inquirer above, it can be seen that he suffers from obsessive-compulsive neurosis: primarily obsessive thoughts (with a focus on obsessive doubts) accompanied by compulsive behaviors.", "Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a type of stress-related neurosis often triggered by significant real-life events. Since Zhang was expelled for fighting, he has faced triple pressure from the school, his family, and the villagers' opinions, leading to a strong sense of remorse. Therefore, after returning to school, he became very cautious in his interactions, appearing as a completely different person. However, due to his long-standing issues, he worries about not being able to overcome them and rekindling dissatisfaction from his classmates and teachers. This makes him extremely sensitive to their reactions, prompting him to exercise more self-restraint. The more he restrains himself, the more concerned he becomes about others' opinions, leading to a fundamental conflict. As the pressure increases and the conflict deepens, the nature of the conflict transforms from worrying about others' views to focusing on his own belongings and body parts, eventually developing into suspicion of others and ultimately skepticism about the learning content.", "The formation of obsessive symptoms often has an obsessive personality as its background. Zhang, originally cheerful, bold, carefree, and unconcerned with trivial matters, tried to change his personality after experiencing a certain event. However, due to incorrect methods of change and improvement, he ended up going to the other extreme, resulting in a personality that became sensitive, suspicious, reclusive, rigid, and timid. This exhibits characteristics of an obsessive personality.", "The patient came to the counseling room for the first time, looking troubled and anxious. After I asked him to sit down, he immediately started to speak: \"Teacher, I am in great pain, and I don't know why. I always have doubts about certain things, even though I feel it's unnecessary, I can't control it, and it makes me very distressed. What do you think I should do?\" From his brief statements, I initially identified this as a form of obsessive symptom. So, I asked him a few specific questions, but he often couldn't articulate his thoughts or spoke incoherently. In this situation, I told him, \"Your issue can be resolved, but you must complete an assignment. After you go back, please focus on the following questions and write them down. First, what are the specific manifestations of your symptoms? How did you feel at the time? It would be best to write them down in chronological order. Second, when did these symptoms first begin? Why? Third, please describe your specific situation from childhood to the present.\"", "A few days later, he came to the counseling room and handed me the completed assignment, the details of which are described above. From his detailed account, I further clarified the characteristics of his symptoms and gained a clearer understanding of the underlying causes. After analysis and consideration, a specific plan and steps for the counseling were developed.", "The first step is to explain to him that he is suffering from a psychological disorder, specifically obsessive doubts associated with obsessive-compulsive neurosis, along with compulsive behaviors. Additionally, further explain the characteristics of this psychological disorder and its general formation process. At the same time, clarify to him that this condition is not what people commonly refer to as a mental illness and will not lead to mental illness, in order to alleviate his unnecessary psychological burden.", "The second step is to discuss the onset process of the condition with the patient, with the aim of helping them understand the causes of the illness, dispelling any doubts they may have, and laying a solid foundation for further treatment.", "In the third step, the hypnotherapy is specifically applied.

Secondly, explain to him the purpose of using hypnotherapy. By going with the flow, the aim is to break the vicious cycle of conscious self-compulsion and counter-compulsion. As long as one goes with the flow, the conflict between compulsion and counter-compulsion will be resolved, and the symptoms will gradually disappear. This enhances his awareness and determination to adopt this method.", "At the same time, cognitive therapy is also included. It specifically explains how to deal with setbacks, particularly emphasizing that the key to handling setbacks is to identify the root causes of the setbacks and to overcome them using precise and rational approaches and methods, rather than negating everything about oneself."], "experience_and_reflection": "Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) often experience a duality in their thoughts and actions, a coexistence of conscious self-compulsion and conscious self-anti-compulsion, which results in significant distress and a sense of being \"out of control.\" This internal conflict is a hallmark of OCD, and its impact extends beyond mere inconvenience, deeply affecting the individual's ability to function in everyday life and social settings. In reflecting on Zhang's case, it becomes evident how these dynamics have played out in his life, shaping his behaviors and perceptions in profound ways.\n\nZhang's journey from being a bold and carefree individual to developing obsessive-compulsive tendencies provides a vivid illustration of the transformative power of psychological stressors and environmental pressures. Initially, Zhang's personality was characterized by fearlessness and a disregard for societal norms, which, while problematic in terms of social conformity, did not inherently predispose him to OCD. However, the pivotal event of his expulsion from school served as a catalyst, triggering a profound shift in his personality and behavior. The pressure from school authorities, familial expectations, and societal judgment created an environment ripe for the development of obsessive-compulsive neurosis.\n\nThis case underscores the role of significant life events in precipitating OCD symptoms. Zhang's experience highlights how the pressure to conform and the fear of repeated ostracism can lead to heightened self-monitoring and obsessive thoughts. His initial attempts to change his behavior—setting strict rules for himself and exercising extreme caution in his interactions—were driven by the desire to avoid further negative repercussions. However, these efforts inadvertently fostered an environment conducive to OCD, as the more he restrained himself, the more he became preoccupied with others' perceptions, leading to a vicious cycle of self-compulsion and anti-compulsion.\n\nThe evolution of Zhang's symptoms—from excessive concern about social interactions to fixations on physical objects and eventually skepticism about academic content—illustrates the progressive nature of OCD. His compulsive behaviors, such as taping cracks on pencils and worrying about stains on clothing, reveal an underlying need for control and certainty, a common theme in OCD. These behaviors serve as coping mechanisms, albeit maladaptive ones, attempting to mitigate the anxiety associated with perceived imperfections or potential disapproval.\n\nZhang's case also highlights the interplay between personality traits and OCD development. Initially possessing a bold and carefree personality, his attempts to change after the expulsion led to an extreme shift towards a more obsessive personality type—sensitive, suspicious, and rigid. This transformation is crucial to understanding the background and perpetuation of his OCD symptoms. The unsuccessful attempt to alter personality traits through rigid self-regulation resulted in heightened susceptibility to obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors.\n\nThe consultation process for Zhang involved several key steps that aimed to address both the symptoms and the underlying psychological mechanisms contributing to his distress. The initial focus was on educating Zhang about his condition, emphasizing that while OCD is a psychological disorder, it does not equate to mental illness in the traditional sense and will not lead to more severe psychiatric conditions. This clarification was intended to alleviate Zhang's anxiety about his symptoms and reduce the stigma associated with OCD.\n\nUnderstanding the onset process of Zhang's condition was another critical component of the consultation. By exploring the triggers and factors contributing to his OCD, the therapeutic process aimed to dispel doubts and misconceptions, laying a foundation for effective treatment. This introspection allowed Zhang to recognize the external pressures and internal conflicts fueling his compulsions, fostering a sense of empowerment in addressing these challenges.\n\nHypnotherapy was introduced as a means to disrupt the cycle of conscious self-compulsion and counter-compulsion. By encouraging Zhang to adopt a natural, nonchalant attitude towards his symptoms, the therapy aimed to break the vicious cycle of overthinking and self-regulation. This approach was designed to help Zhang focus on his tasks without being preoccupied by obsessive thoughts, promoting a gradual reduction in symptom severity.\n\nCognitive therapy complemented hypnotherapy by providing strategies to cope with setbacks and challenges. Emphasizing the importance of identifying the root causes of setbacks and addressing them with rational methods, cognitive therapy helped Zhang develop resilience and a balanced self-perception. This component of the treatment aimed to counteract Zhang's tendency to negate his self-worth in response to perceived failures or imperfections.\n\nReflecting on Zhang's case, the profound impact of OCD on an individual's life becomes evident. Beyond the immediate distress and inconvenience caused by obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors, OCD can severely impair social functioning, academic performance, and overall well-being. Zhang's case illustrates how OCD can distort perceptions, leading to excessive self-monitoring and doubts about seemingly straightforward matters. These thought patterns not only interfere with normal life but can also perpetuate a cycle of anxiety and avoidance, hindering personal growth and development.\n\nClinically, Zhang's case provides valuable insights into the treatment of OCD. The importance of a multifaceted approach that combines education, introspection, hypnotherapy, and cognitive therapy is highlighted. Such an approach addresses both the symptoms and underlying psychological mechanisms, promoting long-term recovery and resilience. Zhang's progress through therapy underscores the potential for individuals with OCD to regain control over their thoughts and actions, improving their quality of life and social functioning.\n\nUltimately, Zhang's case serves as a reminder of the complexities and challenges inherent in treating OCD. It highlights the need for individualized treatment plans that consider the unique personality traits, environmental pressures, and life experiences of each patient. Through comprehensive and compassionate care, individuals like Zhang can navigate the challenges of OCD, fostering hope and empowerment in their journey towards recovery.", "causes": "After being expelled from school for brawling, he faces triple pressure from school, family, and villagers' public opinion; therefore, upon returning to school, the pressure on social norms and the fear of being ostracized again may lead to enhanced self-monitoring and obsessive-compulsive thinking.", "symptoms": "Sensitive, suspicious, withdrawn, rigid, and timid obsessive-compulsive personality with obsessive-compulsive behavior.", "treatment_process": "Listening and empathy techniques: allow the visitor to feel accepted and understood, and to safely explore their self-emotions;\n Hypnotherapy: Breaking the vicious cycle of overthinking and self-regulation by encouraging Zhang to approach her symptoms in a natural, light-hearted manner.

{"id": 145, "case_description": ["Xiaolin, 9 years old, is in the fourth grade of elementary school and has been out of school for over a month. Due to his increasingly bad temper, his father believes he is suffering from depression and came for consultation. During the last session, I used the externalization technique from narrative therapy to separate the child from the problem: the child is not the problem; the child is the child, and the problem is the problem. By helping Xiaolin recognize his own growth potential, we achieved relatively good results in the consultation. In this session, I employed collaborative dialogue techniques to help the whole family identify the issues and the direction for their efforts. I also had profound reflections and personal growth during this session, and I want to express my gratitude to them once again for their trust and for coming to see me!"], "consultation_process": ["After the consultation began, I first took about 10 minutes to use the witnessing technique to observe the growth and changes within the family over the past week: Dad said that Xiao Lin has been throwing fewer tantrums at home, Mom said that Xiao Lin can control his emotions better when he is upset, and Sister noted that Xiao Lin's time playing on his phone and computer games has significantly decreased. Xiao Lin also witnessed the growth of his parents: Mom's tone has become much gentler, and Dad is communicating with him more patiently. After this mutual witnessing, Sister raised a question; she felt that the main issue that this consultation should address is: who in the family should be most responsible for Xiao Lin's problems?", "After the last counseling session, the mother cried very sadly at home because she perceived her husband's and sister's accusations and complaints against her during the session. Moreover, after returning home, both her husband and sister kept emphasizing that she should take primary responsibility for Xiaolin's issues. This made the mother very upset, and she began to criticize her husband's irresponsibility and her sister's bias. At the beginning of the counseling session, the mother was in a low mood and kept complaining: in order to help Xiaolin return to school as soon as possible, she had quit her job to stay home and accompany Xiaolin. For a while now, she had been sleeping with Xiaolin at night to take care of him, and she hadn’t had a good night's sleep. She felt like she was about to break down. \"Teacher, you tell me, after all my hard work, why is it all my fault in the end? His father 'eats cold and ignores sour' yet remains innocent. Teacher, do you think this is fair?\" Seeing the mother's sad and helpless expression, I suddenly remembered a question I asked Xiaolin at the end of the last counseling session: who in your family should receive psychological counseling the most? Xiaolin answered that it was his mother, and at that time I somewhat agreed with his answer, but now I feel that the mother is the one who needs care and help the most. I began to shift my focus to the mother. \n\nIt was understood that this morning, the husband wanted to go back to work, but the wife asked him to rest for another two days to spend time with the child, leading to an argument due to their differing opinions. As soon as Xiaolin heard his parents arguing, his bad temper returned, and so the family of four came for counseling. I remember asking the mother a question: when you encounter problems, what is the difference for you when your husband is by your side and when he is not? The mother thought for a moment, crying as she said, \"When the child throws a tantrum, if my husband is beside me, I feel a sense of support; if he is not there, I feel particularly helpless and really don't know what to do.\" I then asked, \"When you feel particularly helpless, what do you think your husband could do to help you?\" At that moment, something interesting happened. Our seating arrangement was me on the left, then the father, Xiaolin, the mother, and the sister. While the mother was crying, Xiaolin held her hand to comfort her. After hearing my question, Xiaolin immediately stood up and swapped seats with his father. The father then started to explain all the reasons why he had to work, and the mother began to argue why the father should stay home to accompany their son. Just as I was about to hit the \"pause\" button, Xiaolin stood up again, swapped seats with his father, and returned to the original arrangement. I said to everyone to pause the argument for a moment; I wanted to ask Xiaolin why he frequently changed seats with his father, and what was his reasoning behind it. Xiaolin, feeling a bit sad, said, \"I see my mother is sad, and it makes me very uncomfortable. I know that my mother needs my father's care and help the most at this moment, so I changed seats with my father. But my father not only didn’t comfort my mother, he also argued with her. I felt this was inappropriate, so I switched back. I think being next to my mother makes her feel better!\" At this moment, Xiaolin held his mother's hand again and kept stroking her arm.", "Xiaolin, uncle has a question. Uncle knows that your parents have been arguing about \"who should be responsible for your issues\" these days. Remember the last time when uncle was about to finish the consultation, he asked you a question: \"Who do you think in your family of four should receive psychological counseling the most?\" Your answer was your mom, and you listed the reasons why she should receive counseling. If uncle were to ask you that question again now, do you think your answer would have changed? Uncle, my answer has changed! Upon hearing this, I was taken aback and quickly asked for this new answer, but Xiaolin remained silent. Instead, he held his mother's hand with his left hand and his father's hand with his right, pulling them tightly together, so that all three of their hands were clasped together! Xiaolin's behavior was quite unexpected. Xiaolin, can you let uncle guess the thoughts behind your actions? Xiaolin smiled and nodded. I said I think what you mean by doing this is that last time you said your mother should bear the main responsibility for your issues; today’s answer is that your mother is the one who needs everyone’s care and help the most. The responsibility for the issues doesn’t need to be divided; only through the joint effort of the whole family can the problems in your home be better resolved, right? At this point, Xiaolin kept nodding, smiling very happily, and he snuggled closely with his parents, his smile even brighter. The clever older sister immediately took out her phone to take a picture of her brother and parents, saying she wanted to hang the photo in their living room as a keepsake. I asked Xiaolin if the efforts of the whole family also needed the sister’s participation. Xiaolin kept nodding. I took the phone from the sister's hand and personally captured this unforgettable moment for their family. In the photo, the family looked particularly happy and joyful."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on my recent engagement with Xiaolin and his family, I am reminded of the intricate dynamics that underpin family therapy. As a clinician, one of the most profound realizations I've gleaned is the importance of approaching family issues without preconceived biases or the urge to assign blame. This case exemplified how the interrelatedness of family members' actions and emotions can create a network of challenges that are best navigated collaboratively.\n\nIn family therapy, it's essential to cultivate an environment where responsibility is not apportioned in a manner akin to the division of liability in a traffic accident. Rather, it’s about understanding how the interactions and patterns between family members contribute to the issues at hand. In this particular session, the focus inadvertently shifted towards determining who should bear the burden of responsibility for Xiaolin's distress, echoing a societal tendency to pathologize or scapegoat one individual. This perspective, however, can inadvertently exacerbate existing tensions, leading to feelings of guilt and helplessness, as witnessed in Xiaolin's mother. Her tearful question, \"Why is it all my fault in the end?\" poignantly underscores the detrimental impact of such an approach.\n\nThe true efficacy of family therapy lies in depathologizing individuals and fostering an environment where open, sincere dialogue can flourish. It’s within this space that family members can safely engage in self-reflection and genuine expression, free from judgment. In our session, Xiaolin's insightful and unexpected actions highlighted this principle. His gesture of physically uniting his parents' hands served as a powerful metaphor for the interconnected nature of their familial roles and the necessity of mutual support.\n\nThis interaction prompted a deeper reflection on my part. Initially, my question to Xiaolin about who should receive psychological counseling was rooted in an assumption that inadvertently spotlighted his mother as the focal point of the family’s challenges. This assumption was a reflection of a broader societal narrative that often seeks to pinpoint a single source of dysfunction within complex systems. Yet, as Xiaolin demonstrated through his actions, the issues within the family were not the product of one individual's shortcomings but rather the culmination of intricate relational dynamics.\n\nThe session illuminated the significance of shifting from a blame-oriented approach to one that embraces joint responsibility and collective healing. This paradigm shift is crucial for mobilizing each family member's inner potential and fostering growth. By recognizing that family problems are systemic rather than individual, we can empower families to work together towards resolution, much like the metaphor of a barrel where each plank must contribute to the whole to prevent leakage.\n\nIn hindsight, the session reinforced the value of adopting a strengths-based approach in therapy. Instead of focusing solely on identifying and rectifying the 'short plank,' the therapeutic process should involve recognizing the inherent strengths within each family member and encouraging their development. This aligns with the concept of helping each plank—each family member—find its strength, grow, and integrate with the others, thereby enhancing the family's collective capacity to contain and manage their shared challenges.\n\nThe witnessing technique employed at the start of the session was instrumental in setting this collaborative tone. By observing and acknowledging the positive changes within the family, such as Xiaolin's reduced tantrums and his parents' improved communication, we laid the groundwork for a dialogue rooted in mutual appreciation and respect. This witnessing not only validated the family members' efforts but also encouraged them to continue engaging with the therapeutic process.\n\nMoreover, Xiaolin's evolution in recognizing the family's collective responsibility underscores the importance of involving children actively in therapy. Children's perspectives often offer unique insights into family dynamics, and their involvement can serve as a catalyst for change. Xiaolin's initial response about his mother needing counseling reflected his perception of familial roles, but his subsequent actions revealed a deeper understanding of the necessity for joint effort and support.\n\nThis case also highlighted the therapeutic potential of shifting focus within sessions. By pivoting my attention to the mother's needs and facilitating a conversation about support, we uncovered underlying issues that might have otherwise remained unaddressed. This shift not only provided the mother with a sense of validation but also encouraged the family to explore new ways of interacting and supporting one another.\n\nUltimately, the session with Xiaolin's family served as a powerful reminder of the fluidity and complexity of family systems. It reinforced the need for therapists to remain adaptable and open to the evolving dynamics within therapy. By fostering an environment where each family member can express themselves freely and explore their roles within the family, we can create opportunities for healing and growth that extend beyond the confines of the therapy room.\n\nAs I continue to reflect on this case, I am reminded of the importance of humility in therapeutic practice. It is crucial to approach each session with an openness to learning and growth, both for the clients and for myself as a clinician. By embracing this mindset, we can better support families in their journey towards understanding and resolving their challenges, ultimately helping them to build a stronger, more cohesive unit.\n\nIn conclusion, the work with Xiaolin and his family has deepened my appreciation for the complexity of family therapy and the transformative power of collaborative, strengths-based approaches. It is a testament to the resilience and potential for growth inherent in all families, and a reminder that true healing often lies in the collective efforts of the family as a whole.", "causes": "Family tension due to the child's boredom with school.", "symptoms": "Parental dissatisfaction with the division of parenting responsibilities.", "treatment_process": "Listening and empathy techniques: allow the client to feel accepted and understood, and to safely explore their emotions;\n Family Systems Therapy: Shifting the focus to the mother's needs and facilitating conversations about support by engaging family members in self-reflection and honest expression in a non-judgmental environment.

{"id": 146, "case_description": ["Xiaoxin (a pseudonym), a 15-year-old boy in the third year of junior high school at a certain middle school, took the initiative to come for consultation. According to his mother, Xiaoxin has been addicted to playing on his phone for the past year, and his academic performance has dropped from over 100th place in school to over 500th place. However, parental supervision has been ineffective; instead, it often exacerbates conflicts. The child's health has also deteriorated; he frequently experiences stomach discomfort and is prone to mouth ulcers, requiring medication and visiting many places for treatment, but the issues keep recurring."], "consultation_process": ["First Consultation: When Xiaoxin walked in, he looked quite handsome, but there was an undeniable gloom between his brows. He sat on the same sofa as his mother, deliberately keeping his distance from her, while his father sat alone on another sofa looking dejected. I asked Xiaoxin, \"You took the initiative to come to see the teacher, which means you must have encountered some difficult problems that you can't solve by yourself.\" Xiaoxin nodded and said, \"Teacher, I feel like I've changed into a different person over the past year. I know in my head that I need to study hard and put in effort, but my heart just can't settle down. My mind is always a mess, very chaotic.\" His mother said, \"If only you wouldn't play on your phone so much.\" His father chimed in, \"His self-discipline is poor. Teacher, please educate him.\" Xiaoxin stopped talking, but the frown on his face showed his discomfort. I then asked Xiaoxin, \"Would you like to communicate with me alone, or would you prefer to discuss the issues together with your parents?\" Xiaoxin paused and said, \"I want to talk to you alone.\" Watching his parents leave the room, Xiaoxin appeared to relax a bit. He said, \"Teacher, from elementary school to middle school and now, I've always been a class leader. I've always listened to my mom, dad, and teachers, and I've had a smooth journey. But over the past year, I feel like I've completely changed. I get really annoyed with my mom's nagging, and even when she’s right, I don't want to listen or do as she says. Now, whenever I hear my mom's voice, I get frustrated. The worst part is that during class, her voice keeps echoing in my head: 'Stop playing and study!' I have to pull my thoughts back to the classroom over and over again. I really dislike my mom right now, and I feel like she never considers my needs. She always pushes what she thinks is right onto me without asking if I’m willing. She says she has worked hard for me all these years, but I don't want her to be so stressed. I've told her many times, but she doesn't listen. Actually, seeing her so exhausted makes me uncomfortable. Even though I don't listen to her, I feel guilty about it. As for playing on my phone, I can control it myself. I pick it up when I'm feeling restless, but now, when I get home, I feel inexplicably anxious. Sigh!\"", "In Xiao Xin's narrative, there is only the role of the mother in this family; is the father's role absent?", "\"Then what does your dad think?\" \"My dad? He's busy working all day, and even when he comes home, he rarely talks to me. When he does speak, it's either to educate or to lecture me, and I can't be bothered with him.\" This busy dad, I think, might not only be missing the role of a father, but there's also a greater possibility of him missing the role of a husband.", "During the second consultation, I arranged to meet with Xiaoxin's mother. Xiaoxin's mother works in a public institution, and I asked, \"What do you think about Xiaoxin's situation?\" She replied, \"Xiaoxin has always been obedient and sensible since she was little; she's been my pride, and I feel comforted by that. However, ever since she started middle school, this child has changed. I don't know where her mind is all day, and she doesn't say anything when I ask her questions. She's no longer as obedient as she used to be, nor does she focus on her studies like before. Now I feel embarrassed to talk to my colleagues about my child's studies. Whenever others ask, I feel ashamed. Actually, I have opportunities for promotion at work, but I gave them up for my child. It was all for her to do well in school, get into a good university, and have a bright future. Who would have thought it would end up like this?\" \"What kind of support does your husband give you?\" \"Him?\" Xiaoxin's mother fell silent. I remained calm and observed her, waiting for her to speak. After a long while, she finally said slowly, \"He doesn't care about the child, doesn't care about me, and even less about this family. He's only concerned about his work. To be honest, he cares about me less than the child does.\" \"Will you protest to him?\" \"Protest? I wouldn't do that. I've expressed my dissatisfaction before, but was it useful? Eventually, I just gave up and decided to make do!\" Xiaoxin's mother's inner resentment was like a deep pool, and I knew my primary task was to help her process her emotions first.", "Fortunately, Xiaoxin's parents recognized their own issues and were willing to face them. During the subsequent period of counseling, Xiaoxin's parents reached a consensus to change together. As they observed their relationship becoming more harmonious day by day, Xiaoxin unconsciously relieved herself of a heavy burden."], "experience_and_reflection": "Psychological counselors have something to say:\n\nAdolescence is often described as one of the most turbulent periods in a young person's life, filled with rapid changes and emotional upheavals. It is a time when children begin to carve out their own identities, often withdrawing from familial structures and seeking independence. This is a challenging period for every child, often referred to as the child's period of withdrawal. During this time, children may no longer be willing to communicate their inner thoughts to their parents due to the demands of growth. This withdrawal can be perceived as rebellion or disobedience by parents, but in reality, it is a crucial phase of development where the adolescent starts to explore autonomy. The shift in behavior, as observed in Xiaoxin, is not uncommon and should be approached with understanding and patience by parents.\n\nXiaoxin's case exemplifies the psychological and physical manifestations of stress during adolescence. His frequent experiences of gastrointestinal discomfort, headaches, mouth ulcers, or cold and fever are indicative of a deeper psychological turmoil. When a child frequently experiences such physical issues, parents and caregivers must be alert; it signifies that the child is under too much pressure. This stress may stem from various sources, including academic pressures, familial expectations, and the internal conflict of wanting to meet those expectations while also asserting independence.\n\nThe greatest assistance we can provide to our children during these tumultuous times is to take care of ourselves, manage our own emotions, and maintain our marriage well. The parental relationship serves as a model for children, influencing their perception of relationships and emotional regulation. If parents are able to maintain a harmonious relationship, it creates a stable environment in which children can thrive. This stability allows children to move forward unencumbered and become confident adolescents, as they are not burdened by the emotional distress of their home environment.\n\nConsultation Case Analysis:\n\nIn Xiaoxin's case, a significant observation was the lack of effective communication within the family. When a family no longer chooses to communicate and interact to solve problems, they tend to opt for avoidance and repression. This avoidance, as seen in Xiaoxin's family, leads to a build-up of resentment, which can overshadow the entire familial atmosphere. The lack of open dialogue between Xiaoxin and his parents has resulted in misunderstandings and feelings of alienation. Over time, this avoidance and repression can lead to resentment, overshadowing the entire family. How can such accumulated resentment be completely suppressed? It cannot be; it will find expression in various forms, often unhealthy ones.\n\nXiaoxin's mother, in her attempt to cope with her own stress, unconsciously resorts to nagging—a behavior that greatly affects the child's independence and healthy growth. This nagging is not only a symptom of her own stress but also a misguided attempt to guide Xiaoxin back to the path she deems appropriate. However, Xiaoxin's mother remains oblivious to the fact that her way of coping is counterproductive, leading to further alienation and rebellion from Xiaoxin.\n\nThe absence of a father figure in Xiaoxin's life is another critical aspect of this case. Xiaoxin's father, preoccupied with work, has inadvertently become an absent figure in the family dynamic. Due to the absence of a father figure at home, Xiaoxin automatically takes on the father's role, wanting to save his mother while feeling both guilt and resentment towards his dad. This lack of presence creates a void that Xiaoxin feels compelled to fill, taking on responsibilities and emotions that are beyond his years. This young boy bears his mother's repression, assumes the role of the father at home, and faces the contradictions of growing up—being pulled by his mother while wanting to be independent, feeling conflicted, lost, ashamed, and entangled, all while shouldering his parents' criticisms and discontent. The weight of these expectations and the emotional burden is overwhelming for Xiaoxin, leading him to seek escape through his phone, a common refuge for many adolescents in similar situations.\n\nWhen children face problems that their parents cannot effectively help with, and they exhaust all their energy without a solution (as children often brainstorm many ways during counseling), they may temporarily escape the pressure, such as playing on their phone or gaming. This escape is not an acknowledgment of failure but rather a coping mechanism for the stress and emotional turmoil that they cannot otherwise process. However, this form of avoidance also places an invisible pressure on the child, as it is not a method he acknowledges. The guilt associated with avoiding responsibilities further compounds the stress, creating a vicious cycle that is difficult to break without intervention.\n\nEvery child is inherently motivated and deeply loyal to their parents. This intrinsic motivation is often overshadowed by the stress and expectations placed upon them, leading to physical manifestations of stress, as seen in Xiaoxin's recurrent gastrointestinal discomfort, mouth ulcers, and frequent colds and fevers. These physical symptoms are a cry for help, a signal that the child is overwhelmed and needs support beyond traditional medical intervention. Parents must take this seriously and seek help from professional psychological counselors in a timely manner.\n\nA crucial aspect of intervention is addressing the family dynamics that contribute to the child's stress. In Xiaoxin's case, the willingness of his parents to recognize their issues and work towards change was pivotal. Fortunately, Xiaoxin's parents recognized their own issues and were willing to face them. During the subsequent period of counseling, Xiaoxin's parents reached a consensus to change together. This commitment to change was not just about altering their parenting strategies but also about addressing the underlying issues in their marriage and communication. As they observed their relationship becoming more harmonious day by day, Xiaoxin unconsciously relieved herself of a heavy burden. This improvement in the parental relationship created a more supportive and less stressful environment for Xiaoxin, allowing him to focus on his development and reduce his reliance on escapism through his phone.\n\nReflecting on this case, it becomes evident that the role of the counselor is not just to address the immediate concerns of the child but to delve deeper into the family dynamics that contribute to these issues. It requires a holistic approach, considering the emotional, psychological, and physical well-being of the child, while also supporting the parents in their journey towards a healthier family dynamic.\n\nIn conclusion, Xiaoxin's case serves as a reminder of the complexities of adolescence and the critical role that family dynamics play in the well-being of young individuals. It highlights the importance of communication, understanding, and support within the family structure, and the need for professional intervention when these elements are lacking. By addressing these issues, families can create an environment where children like Xiaoxin can thrive, free from the burdens of stress and expectation, and able to embrace their journey into adulthood with confidence and resilience.", "causes": "Cell phone dependence in adolescent children due to family conflict.", "symptoms": "Stressful behavior that leads to cell phone addiction and escapism, accompanied by somatization symptoms such as stomach pain and mouth ulcers.", "treatment_process": "Listening and empathy techniques: allow visitors to feel accepted and understood, and safely explore their own emotions;\n Family systemic therapy: by allowing family members to engage in self-reflection and sincere expression in a non-judgmental environment, the focus of attention is turned to tense and contradictory family relationships, so that it becomes clear that the greatest help parents can provide for their children is to take care of themselves, manage their own emotions, and maintain a good marital relationship.", "characteristics_of_illness": "The fluidity and complexity of family systems.", "treatment_effect": "Through the treatment, the parents' relationship became more harmonious and Xiaoxin unconsciously lifted her heavy psychological burden.

{"id": 147, "case_description": ["Due to her experience of failing the high school entrance examination, senior high school student Qi faced significant psychological pressure on the eve of the college entrance examination, exhibiting symptoms of obsessive thinking that interfered with her studies. The counselor helped her through Morita therapy to learn to accept herself while striving to do her best, alleviating the negative impact of excessive stress. After the college entrance examination, Qi was admitted to Shanghai University of Finance and Economics with a ranking of over 200 in the province."], "consultation_process": ["\"In the past, when I was feeling normal, I thought that psychological issues weren’t a big deal, but now, I feel utterly hopeless. Previously, I often advised others not to get stuck in their thoughts, but now I find myself trapped in a cycle of overthinking, unable to break free...\" As Qi wiped her tears, she shared her distress, her eyes filled with pain and despair. Qi is a senior in high school. For the past month, she has been unable to control herself, constantly ruminating on the problems she encounters in her studies, over and over again, because she always doubts whether she really understands the material. She can't let go of the mistakes she makes, repeatedly memorizing information she fears she might forget, especially during exams when she worries she won't recall relevant knowledge. Additionally, she finds herself pondering seemingly unnecessary questions, like why certain words are spelled that way. Qi thinks this is somewhat absurd, yet she can't convince herself to stop thinking. As a result, she is restless and her study efficiency is declining, saying, \"There are too many problems; thinking like this is overwhelming. So, I can't sleep at night, and even when I do fall asleep, I wake up quickly.\" \"Teacher, do I have obsessive-compulsive disorder?\" One must admit that \"obsessive\" is a relatively popular term in mental health, leading many people to self-diagnose based on symptoms they perceive, which is often just labeling. However, if the labeling is inaccurate, it can have the opposite effect, causing individuals to increasingly identify as patients through suggestion, leading to greater helplessness. Qi's symptoms are characterized as \"obsessive rumination.\" The hallmark of this symptom is that individuals fixate on a particular issue or question for an extended period, such as \"Why do people speak?\" \"Where do people come from?\" \"Why does one plus one equal two?\" Some students repeatedly ponder a specific question or knowledge point, and so on. They sometimes know that this kind of thinking is meaningless, yet they cannot control themselves from doing it. However, arriving at a diagnosis based solely on this symptom is often inaccurate and irresponsible. The diagnostic criteria for psychological disorders and issues include not only symptom criteria but also severity, duration, and exclusion criteria. Although Qi exhibits obsessive symptoms, she does not meet the diagnostic criteria on other standards. For example, in terms of severity, Qi only has moderate social functional impairment (decreased study efficiency). She even performed well in her final exams a week ago, ranking fourth in her class (Qi first came to consult on the evening of January 24, 2007, and her final exams were from January 17-19). Moreover, in terms of duration, her symptoms fall significantly short of the three-month criterion, so Qi is not an obsessive-compulsive disorder patient, and this label is 100% incorrect. So what exactly is Qi's problem? Based on various data and the three principles used to determine mental health, Qi demonstrates coherent awareness, stable personality, self-awareness, and actively seeks help, showing no signs of hallucinations or delusions that would indicate a psychotic disorder. Therefore, psychosis can be ruled out. From Qi's clinical presentation, she exhibits certain somatic symptoms, obsessive symptoms, and some anxiety and depression, but her uncontrollable ruminations are linked to the high-stakes event of the college entrance exam, as she worries about not fully understanding the material, prompting her to ruminate to stabilize her emotions. The time frame is also just one month, and the severity only mildly affects her study and life. According to Professor Xu Youxin's clinical assessment methods for neuroses, we can conclude that Qi's issues belong to neurotic psychological problems (or suspected neurosis). Therefore, in response to Qi's concerns, I decisively told her, \"No, I don’t think you have obsessive-compulsive disorder. On the contrary, I believe your mental state is normal. In fact, many seniors experience some maladaptive symptoms during the latter part of their studies. For example, some are sensitive to minor noises (like the sound of writing or turning pages); others, like you, easily get distracted by unnecessary thoughts. In my senior year, every time I took an exam, I had to go to the bathroom halfway through, even if I couldn’t urinate afterward; I just had to go, or I couldn’t continue. These symptoms are related to the reality we face, as you are worried about the college entrance exam, which is why you keep thinking about study-related problems.\" At that moment, Qi sat up straighter, looked at me without avoidance, and I could see a glimmer of hope in her eyes. Yes, human despair often stems from loneliness. My words made her realize that many classmates, like herself, are facing the challenges of the college entrance exam and experiencing anxiety, exhibiting some abnormal symptoms, but these are all normal. My own experience during my senior year also unconsciously narrowed the distance between us. Why is Qi experiencing such issues? \"Did you encounter any problems a month ago?\" I asked her. \"A month ago, I made a mistake on a math problem. After correcting it, I doubted whether I really understood it. So I kept thinking about it, but I couldn't trust myself, and soon the problems piled up, leaving me exhausted. Sometimes I question the necessity of this thinking, but I can’t stop.\" It seems that Qi lacks self-confidence. In reality, her grades are quite good; she ranks among the top in a provincial key school with a nearly 90% admission rate. Yet, she doubts whether she has even grasped the basics, which is incongruent with her academic performance. The intense self-doubt began with a test mistake, but what does this mistake have to do with the upcoming college entrance exam? Over three years of study, Qi cannot have had only this one mistake, so why did this issue arise halfway through her senior year? The mistake a month ago easily connects to the college entrance exam, likely due to Qi's past experiences. \"Have you ever failed an exam?\" \"Yes, I didn't do well in my high school entrance exam.\" Qi is a transfer student. \"How does not doing well in the high school entrance exam relate to your college entrance exam?\" \"I feel it's fate. I'm afraid I might not have what it takes. My cousin, however, has what it takes; her grades are not as good as mine, but she got incense from our grandmother before her exam, and she succeeded.\" \"Well, you can also burn incense and pray!\" Qi smiled, a hint of helplessness in her expression. Clearly, she believes that praying has no effect on changing fate. Qi is a smart girl, with countless successes to prove her capability, yet she allows one failure to prove her inadequacy, choosing to believe she is not good enough. This strange connection stems from her attribution style towards success and failure: external attribution. It is apparent that Qi's personality type leans towards external locus of control. Individuals with an external locus of control believe that external forces dominate their lives, rendering them powerless over their own life choices. To Qi, it seems as though an invisible hand is controlling her; she cannot determine the outcomes of her actions, leading her, despite her excellent performance, to doubt herself, as she believes it is fate rather than the result of effort. Therefore, halfway through her senior year, as the college entrance exam approaches, Qi's psychological burden nears its limit. At this time, due to her lack of confidence and doubts about her abilities, Qi has learned to use seemingly unnecessary ruminations to calm herself, as she feels a sense of certainty while thinking. \"Surely you've heard many stories that defy fate, right?\" \"Yes, but I still can't convince myself.\" \"See, this stems from your choice. There are many stories around us that tell us fate is predetermined, but there are also many stories that tell us fate is in our own hands. I guess you remember more of those predetermined fate stories, right?\" \"That's true.\" Qi smiled shyly. \"In fact, our emotions and behaviors when facing an event are not determined by the event itself. In the face of misfortune, some people choose to succumb while others choose to be strong, leading to different fates. The final result appears to be predetermined, but fate can be changed.\" At this point, Qi seemed to have an epiphany. I took the opportunity to discuss Schachter's emotion experiments and theories, helping her to understand the role of cognition more deeply. However, Qi asked how she could eliminate those excessive thoughts, as she sees this as the most pressing issue. \"Do you think having distracting thoughts is wrong?\" \"Yes.\" \"But actually, we all have distracting thoughts, even when we are doing important things; for some, they are fleeting, while others hold onto them tightly.\" \"I'm one of those who holds onto them tightly.\" \"Yes, you grasp them and ruminate on them repeatedly, which undoubtedly interferes with your studies and life. But if you allow their existence, you can be like others; they will 'come and go' instead of becoming unending.\" \"So what should I do?\" \"Accept them, treat them like good friends.\" \"Your awareness is, 'If I think, then I'll think?'\" \"What I mean is to let it flow naturally.\" \"Think when you think, let it be, don't mind it or force it!\" \"Let it flow naturally.\" \"Yes, let it flow naturally.\" \"Let it flow naturally\" is a therapeutic method derived from Morita therapy. The reason I offered this suggestion to Qi is that her excessive rumination is related not only to her inappropriate cognitive attribution style and lack of self-confidence but also to her repressed anxiety. When facing the college entrance exam, how many students believe they have a 100% certainty? Most inevitably harbor doubts similar to Qi's, which lead to anxiety and fear. However, many people release their anxiety through appropriate means, such as talking to trusted teachers and friends for support and encouragement, exercising, or journaling. But Qi is an introverted girl; since entering high school and separating from her close friends from middle school, she has not made any close friends again, and her communication with her parents is very limited. Qi's social support system is rather inadequate. Moreover, her personality is somewhat rigid and has perfectionist tendencies; she believes in being focused and undistracted in her tasks, to the extent that she cannot talk while watching TV, or she feels she won’t understand the plot. Therefore, when faced with the significant pressure of the college entrance exam, Qi's anxiety increased while she found no way to relieve it, causing distracting thoughts to surface. This is a form of indirect anxiety release; their appearance is actually helping Qi alleviate her tense and anxious emotions. Thus, only when she thinks about problems can she feel a sense of security, and once she stops thinking, she begins to doubt herself. This is why Qi cannot stop ruminating. So, giving Qi the advice to \"let it flow naturally\" rather than teaching her how to avoid thinking is much more effective. I told her, \"Thinking is like your friend. You originally had a regular meeting, like going to KFC every weekend. But then you became busy and couldn’t meet up, so you told her, 'Let’s do it another time.' This way, your friend keeps asking you when that time is. Before you give an answer, what was a normal situation turns into harassment. The same goes for these thoughts; they might have been normal, but you never give them a chance, so they keep popping up to bother you.\" So, I advised Qi to set aside half an hour each day to do whatever she enjoys. In fact, half an hour is not hard to find, as the time Qi spends worrying far exceeds that. Qi accepted this. The next evening, Qi returned and told me that she followed my method, and indeed, her thoughts decreased significantly, and her mood improved a lot. Importantly, she felt more confident in overcoming her pain. But she still asked me, \"If I continue doing this, will I stop thinking?\" \"Not stop thinking, just not care.\" I denied it because if I told her she could completely eliminate her thoughts, Qi would eagerly await that day, which would intensify her anxiety and contradict the principle of \"letting it flow naturally.\" So, I reiterated the principle of letting it flow naturally. Regarding her concern about being overly nervous affecting her performance in exams, I taught her to practice meditation for relaxation. After all, if Qi constantly worries about performing poorly on the exam, it will be challenging for her to resolve her issues. I was pleased to find that Qi has a strong capacity for visualization since she often imagines various scenarios. She is confident in herself. A week later, Qi came to the counseling room for the third time. Although her situation had improved, she still occasionally ruminated on issues, and she was very concerned about when she would stop thinking. The problem had resurfaced. So, I reiterated the principle of \"letting it flow naturally\" and added four words: \"Do what you ought to do.\" I explained to her that she was too eager for results (overly eager), which hindered her from fully applying the principle of \"letting it flow naturally.\" I told her that many people can still perform well in their tasks when faced with distractions, as long as they focus (do what you ought to do). We then did a practice session, and Qi chose to read a 2000-word essay while I talked about news I had seen the previous day and expressed my gratitude. After reading, she told me, \"At first, I couldn’t get into it; I wanted to listen to what you were saying, but I tried hard to focus, and by the end, I understood it. I didn’t even know what you were saying; it was like I didn’t hear you.\" I couldn’t help but applaud her; she used to be someone who wouldn't allow anyone to talk while watching TV. Without needing to say more, she indicated that she understood how to proceed and felt confident in doing better. But I still told her that in the future, if she feels difficulties, she can come back. The recurrence of problems is natural; healing and strengthening of the mind is a spiral process that may not always show clear progress and can even feel like regression at times. As long as she views it normally, it’s fine. Qi left again, satisfied. After the college entrance exam, Qi scored in the top 200 in the province and enrolled at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics to continue her studies.\""], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on Qi's journey through her emotional struggles, this case serves as a profound reminder of the complex interplay between psychological stressors, individual cognitive patterns, and therapeutic interventions. At the heart of Qi's experience was the mounting pressure of the impending college entrance examination, a common but uniquely stressful period for many adolescents. This case highlights the critical importance of understanding not just the symptoms presented by clients, but the underlying cognitive and emotional landscapes that give rise to these symptoms.\n\nInitially, Qi's symptoms of obsessive thinking and rumination seemed to suggest a possible diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, upon deeper clinical investigation, it became evident that her symptoms were more accurately characterized as obsessive rumination linked to situational stressors, rather than a pervasive and debilitating disorder like OCD. This distinction is crucial in clinical practice, as mislabeling can lead to inappropriate treatment approaches and exacerbate the client's sense of helplessness and self-doubt.\n\nQi's tendency towards rumination was intricately connected to her attribution style, which leaned heavily on external locus of control. This cognitive pattern meant that Qi often perceived her successes and failures as influenced by factors outside her control, such as fate or luck. This belief system can be incredibly disempowering, especially in high-stakes situations like exams, where the perceived stakes are incredibly high. It's essential for clinicians to explore these attribution styles, as they can significantly influence how clients respond to stress and setbacks.\n\nThe therapeutic journey with Qi involved not only addressing her symptoms but also reshaping her cognitive attributions. By helping Qi recognize her tendency to attribute success to external factors, we could guide her towards developing a more internal locus of control, where she could see her efforts and abilities as pivotal to her outcomes. This shift is not about dismissing the role of luck or external circumstances but about empowering clients to see their agency within their lives.\n\nMorita therapy played a significant role in Qi's treatment, particularly the principle of \"letting it flow naturally.\" This approach aligns with the notion that not all thoughts need to be controlled or eliminated. Instead, by accepting their presence and learning to coexist with them, clients like Qi can reduce their anxiety and the compulsive need to control their thought processes. This method is particularly effective in addressing the type of ruminative thinking Qi experienced, where the very act of trying to suppress thoughts often amplifies their intensity.\n\nQi's case also underscores the importance of a supportive social environment. Her limited social support system, coupled with her introverted nature, meant she lacked adequate outlets for emotional expression and stress relief. Encouraging clients to build or strengthen their social networks can provide them with additional resources to manage stress, share experiences, and feel less isolated in their struggles.\n\nIn our sessions, we explored the concept of \"doing what you ought to do,\" emphasizing the importance of focusing on tasks at hand despite distractions. This pragmatic approach, combined with mindfulness and meditation techniques, helped Qi develop greater focus and resilience. By practicing mindfulness, Qi could ground herself in the present moment, reducing the power of intrusive thoughts and fostering a sense of calm.\n\nQi's progress was a testament to her resilience and willingness to engage deeply with therapeutic processes. Her story highlights the value of personalized therapeutic approaches that consider the client's unique cognitive, emotional, and situational context. It's crucial for therapists to remain flexible and open, adapting methods to suit the individual needs of each client rather than adhering rigidly to one therapeutic model.\n\nMoreover, Qi's journey reflects a broader societal challenge, where academic pressure and the pursuit of perfection can lead to significant mental health issues among students. As clinicians, it is our responsibility to not only support individuals like Qi but also advocate for systemic changes that promote mental well-being in educational settings. Encouraging schools to integrate mental health awareness and support into their curricula could play a vital role in preventing issues like those Qi experienced.\n\nReflecting on this case, I am reminded of the delicate balance between providing support and fostering independence. While therapeutic guidance is essential, empowering clients to develop their problem-solving skills and resilience is equally important. Qi's ability to eventually navigate her thoughts independently was a significant milestone, indicating her growth and the effectiveness of our collaborative efforts.\n\nIn conclusion, Qi's case illustrates the intricate dance between stress, cognitive patterns, and therapeutic interventions. It reinforces the importance of a holistic approach that considers the client's entire psychosocial context. As clinicians, our role extends beyond symptom management to fostering environments where clients can explore, understand, and ultimately reshape their mental landscapes. Through this process, clients like Qi can emerge not only with reduced symptoms but with a newfound sense of agency and confidence in their ability to face future challenges.", "causes": "Compulsive rumination due to a major stressful event (college entrance exam).", "symptoms": "Overthinking.", "treatment_process": "Listening and empathy techniques: allow the visitor to feel accepted and understood, and to safely explore their emotions;\n Morita therapy: by allowing the visitor to go with the flow, accept their own thinking, do what they need to do, and continue to learn.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Excessive rumination is related not only to the visitor's inappropriate cognitive attributions (external attributions) and lack of self-confidence, but also to her repressed anxiety.", "treatment_effect": "Through therapy, the visitor gradually builds up a sense of internal control and is able to see her own efforts and abilities as key factors in achieving her goals, thus enhancing her sense of self-efficacy.

However, my classmates did not meet her expectations, so she felt frustrated and unfulfilled."], "experience_and_reflection": "Yan Yan's life story is a complex tapestry woven with threads of longing, invisibility, and a continuous struggle for recognition and acceptance. Her experiences reflect a deeply ingrained pattern where she has often felt overlooked and undervalued by those closest to her, including family members, friends, and even authority figures such as teachers. This pervasive sense of invisibility is not just a reaction to external circumstances but has become an intrinsic part of her identity, shaping her interactions and relationships with the world around her.\n\nFrom a young age, Yan Yan's self-worth and identity have been tied to the perceptions and expectations of others, especially her parents. Her mother, a dominating figure in her life, has imposed strict controls, making decisions for Yan Yan without consideration for her desires or opinions. This authoritarian dynamic has left Yan Yan feeling powerless, leading to a profound sense of frustration and a yearning for autonomy. Her father's passive role, often acquiescing to her mother's demands, has further isolated her, leaving her without an ally or advocate within her family. This dynamic has created a fertile ground for feelings of neglect and invisibility, as Yan Yan finds herself unable to assert her needs or express her emotions freely.\n\nYan Yan's interactions outside her family mirror the dynamics she experiences at home. Her relationships are characterized by a tendency to please others, often sacrificing her own needs and desires to gain approval and acceptance. This pattern stems from her childhood experiences, where she learned that compliance and docility were rewarded, while assertiveness and independence were frowned upon. Her attempts to conform to the expectations of others have not only stifled her individuality but have also led to feelings of resentment and unfulfillment. This internal conflict is exacerbated by her longing for genuine connection and intimacy, which is paradoxically coupled with a fear of vulnerability and a reluctance to let others get too close.\n\nIn examining Yan Yan's life through the lens of art therapy, her self-portrait reveals profound insights into her psyche. The faint strokes of her drawing reflect her insecurity and hesitation, as if she is unsure about her place in the world. The choice of a cartoon character, a perfect and beautiful princess, symbolizes her idealized self-image, one that she feels compelled to present to the world. Yet, this image is tinged with sadness, as it represents the disparity between how she wants to be perceived and the reality of her inner turmoil. Her depiction of sorrowful eyes suggests a deep, unmet need for recognition and understanding, a desire to be seen for who she truly is rather than the facade she presents.\n\nThe second painting, \"My Family,\" provides further insight into Yan Yan's relational dynamics. The absence of her mother in the picture is a poignant reflection of their strained relationship, highlighting Yan Yan's desire to distance herself from her mother's influence. The depiction of her father as a rational, silent figure and her uncle as a powerful, controlling presence underscores the familial hierarchy that Yan Yan perceives, where her own needs are often overshadowed by those of more dominant personalities. Her inclusion of her college friend, despite their estrangement, indicates a yearning for connection and a longing for the friendships she once had but has since lost.\n\nThese artistic expressions serve as a metaphorical exploration of Yan Yan's inner world, revealing her struggles with identity, self-worth, and relational dynamics. Her pursuit of perfection is not merely an aspiration but a coping mechanism, a way to compensate for the lack of validation and recognition she receives from those around her. This perfectionism, however, is both a driving force and a source of distress, as it exacerbates her fear of inadequacy and her anxiety about being surpassed by others. Her academic achievements, while a source of pride, have been marred by an underlying fear of failure and a constant pressure to outperform her peers, further alienating her from potential friendships and social interactions.\n\nYan Yan's journey is marked by a series of attempts to break free from the constraints imposed upon her, yet her efforts are often thwarted by her internalized patterns of behavior. Her fear of intimacy, coupled with her need to escape when relationships become too close, reflects a deep-seated ambivalence toward connection. She longs for closeness but is simultaneously terrified of losing herself in the process, fearing that such relationships might consume her and further diminish her sense of self. This paradoxical pattern is a key obstacle in her quest for meaningful relationships and is indicative of the protective barriers she has erected to shield herself from potential hurt and rejection.\n\nIn reflecting on Yan Yan's case, it becomes evident that her struggles are not isolated to her interpersonal relationships but are deeply rooted in her self-perception and the narrative she has constructed about her worth. Her sense of invisibility is intertwined with her identity, shaping her interactions and influencing her decisions. Her artistic expressions provide a valuable window into her psyche, offering a non-verbal means of exploring and understanding her experiences. Through art therapy, Yan Yan is able to communicate aspects of her identity that are difficult to articulate through words, allowing her to process her emotions and experiences in a safe and supportive environment.\n\nAs Yan Yan continues her therapeutic journey, the focus will be on fostering self-acceptance and helping her develop a more integrated and authentic sense of self. This involves challenging the internalized beliefs that have led to her feelings of inadequacy and invisibility, encouraging her to explore and assert her needs and desires without fear of judgment or rejection. By building a foundation of self-worth that is independent of external validation, Yan Yan can begin to cultivate healthier and more fulfilling relationships, free from the constraints of her past patterns.\n\nIn conclusion, Yan Yan's case is a testament to the complexity of human relationships and the profound impact of familial dynamics on individual development. Her story highlights the importance of understanding the intricate interplay between identity, self-worth, and interpersonal connections. Through art therapy and continued exploration, Yan Yan has the opportunity to rewrite her narrative, embracing her individuality and finding her voice amidst the silence that has long defined her existence. Her journey is one of transformation, as she learns to navigate the delicate balance between connection and autonomy, ultimately finding warmth and fulfillment in her relationships and her life.", "causes": "Low sense of self-worth, poor interpersonal relationships, and depressive tendencies due to mother's strength.", "symptoms": "Pain, depression, desire for external recognition and support, inability to establish intimate relationships.", "treatment_process": "Listening and empathy techniques: allow the visitor to feel accepted and understood, and safely explore their emotions;\n Art therapy: allowing the visitor to express his/her repressed emotions and self through painting, and accepting the strong inner need for recognition and understanding.", "characteristics_of_illness": "The desire for and fear of intimacy are key barriers to her pursuit of meaningful relationships, indicative of the defensive barriers she has built to protect herself from harm.", "treatment_effect": "Through the treatment, the client gradually accepts herself, builds up her self-worth, gets rid of her unconditional obedience to authority, and strengthens her autonomy."}

While the initial focus was on repairing the marriage, it became clear that the emotional turmoil experienced by the help seeker was an equally significant concern that required immediate attention. Addressing emotional issues became a priority, not only to facilitate the repair process but also to ensure the overall well-being of the help seeker. This insight underscores the importance of prioritizing emotional healing in any therapeutic endeavor, especially when interpersonal relationships are involved.\n\nThe establishment of a good counseling relationship proved to be the most crucial factor in achieving effective results. A sincere and trusting therapeutic alliance is fundamental, particularly in situations where the client is experiencing heightened vulnerability and distress. The creation of such a relationship allows for a safe space in which the client can explore their feelings and experiences without fear of judgment or rejection. In this case, the cultivation of trust was essential in enabling the help seeker to engage fully with the therapeutic process and to openly discuss the intricacies of her marriage and personal struggles.\n\nThe rigidity of scheduled counseling sessions every three to four days was challenged by the inherent helplessness felt by the seeker. At the beginning of the process, the client required immediate support, understanding, and empathy to navigate her emotional issues. It became apparent that flexibility in scheduling was necessary to accommodate the fluctuating emotional needs of the client and to provide timely interventions when crises arose. This flexibility allowed for a more responsive and dynamic therapeutic approach, which ultimately supported the client's progress.\n\nRepairing a marriage is a multifaceted and challenging task that cannot rely solely on the efforts of the seeker. The involvement of the family unit proved to be indispensable in this case. The support from the client's brother and sister-in-law, as well as the eventual intervention of her mother, played a pivotal role in the repair process. It became clear that the collective strength and involvement of family members are vital components in facilitating reconciliation and healing in marital relationships. The family's active participation helped in implementing the repair plans, addressing emotional and practical challenges, and reinforcing the client's position within the family structure.\n\nThe development of specific ideas and tailored counseling plans was imperative, given the unique circumstances of this case. A one-size-fits-all approach to marital repair is unrealistic, as each situation presents its own set of challenges and dynamics. Throughout the consultations, the need for timely adjustments to the repair plan became evident, allowing for flexibility in response to changing conditions and new insights. This adaptability was crucial in maintaining momentum in the repair process and ensuring that interventions remained relevant and effective.\n\nThe main concern of the seeker regarding the duration and number of counseling sessions required to restore her marriage was addressed with clarity. The process of repairing a marriage is inherently complex, as the emergence of conflicts and the deterioration of the relationship often occur over an extended period. Therefore, the resolution and repair of these issues also necessitate a comprehensive and prolonged approach. It was communicated to the client that the journey toward reconciliation would require patience and persistence, as each individual's problems are distinct and require a tailored therapeutic strategy.\n\nBeyond the core insights of the original reflection, additional clinical analysis revealed the intricate interplay between the help seeker's personal growth history, personality traits, and the dynamics of her marriage. Understanding the family of origin and personal growth history provided a rich context for exploring the deep-rooted patterns and beliefs influencing the help seeker's perception of marriage and love. The analysis of personality traits highlighted areas such as low self-esteem, social withdrawal, and emotional volatility, which were crucial in shaping the client's responses to marital challenges.\n\nThe application of various therapeutic modalities, including hypnotherapy, narrative therapy, and family systems theory, allowed for a holistic approach to addressing the help seeker's emotional issues and the marital conflict. Hypnotherapy provided a means of relaxation and emotional release, facilitating the client's ability to cope with stress and anxiety. Narrative therapy empowered the help seeker to reframe her experiences, fostering a sense of agency and hope in the face of adversity. Family systems theory offered insights into the relational dynamics within the family, enabling interventions that strengthened family bonds and supported marital repair.\n\nThe consultation process highlighted the importance of leveraging favorable conditions within the marital context, such as the husband's strong attachment to past traumas and his filial nature. These factors were instrumental in guiding the therapeutic interventions, as they provided points of connection and motivation for change. The husband's role as a good father and the couple's shared experiences of overcoming challenges together were valuable assets that reinforced the emotional foundation of their relationship.\n\nThe integration of cognitive behavioral therapy into the therapeutic process addressed the help seeker's distorted perceptions and pessimistic outlook. By challenging maladaptive thoughts and promoting healthier cognitive patterns, the therapy facilitated a shift toward more constructive and positive interactions within the marriage. This cognitive restructuring was crucial in enhancing the help seeker's emotional resilience and ability to navigate marital conflicts.\n\nThe gradual decrease in the husband's drinking and the eventual severance of ties with the third party marked significant milestones in the repair process. These developments were facilitated by a combination of therapeutic interventions and the strategic involvement of family members. The decision for the older brother to take the husband and children to pay respects at the ancestral grave was a culturally significant intervention that reinforced familial values and obligations, encouraging the husband to reevaluate his priorities.\n\nThe enforcement of economic and emotional blockades on the help seeker's husband was a decisive measure that underscored the collective resolve of the family to support the help seeker and safeguard the integrity of the marriage. This intervention highlighted the importance of addressing practical issues alongside emotional concerns, ensuring a comprehensive approach to marital repair.\n\nAs the consultations progressed, the help seeker's emotional state improved significantly, with notable resolutions of sleep issues and the disappearance of hallucinations. The narrative therapy sessions enabled her to articulate and process her experiences, fostering a sense of empowerment and clarity. The active engagement in the therapeutic process and the support from family members contributed to a gradual improvement in the couple's relationship, culminating in the husband's return to the family and the restoration of marital roles.\n\nReflecting on this case, it is evident that the journey toward marital repair and emotional healing is a complex and multifaceted process. The integration of diverse therapeutic modalities, the involvement of family, and the cultivation of a trusting counseling relationship were pivotal in achieving positive outcomes. This case serves as a testament to the resilience of individuals and families in the face of adversity and the transformative power of comprehensive and empathetic therapeutic interventions.", "causes": "Depressive tendencies triggered by the marital crisis caused by the husband's infidelity.", "symptoms": "Low self-esteem, social withdrawal, mood swings, pessimism, insomnia, nightmares, auditory and visual hallucinations, and severe emotional problems.", "treatment_process": "Listening and empathy techniques: allows the client to feel accepted and understood, and to safely explore their emotions;\n Hypnotherapy: provides clients with avenues for relaxation and emotional release, helping them to cope with stress and anxiety;\n Narrative therapy: empowers clients to reinterpret their experiences, enabling them to develop a sense of autonomy and hope in the face of adversity;\n Family Systems Therapy: reveals the relational dynamics within the family, providing a basis for intervention to strengthen family bonds and support marital repair.", "characteristics_of_illness": "The collective strength and engagement of family members is an important component in promoting reconciliation and healing in the marital relationship.", "treatment_effect": "The treatment resulted in significant improvement in the visitor's emotional state, resolution of sleep problems, and disappearance of hallucinations.

Psychotherapy can directly change cognition, thereby altering emotions and behaviors.

Psychotherapy plays an irreplaceable role that medication cannot fulfill."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on this case and considering the broader context of depression treatment and understanding, several profound insights emerge that underscore the complexity and multifaceted nature of depression. This reflection aims to delve deeper into these insights, drawing from the detailed case information and enhancing it with additional clinical perspectives.\n\nDepression, as illustrated in this case, manifests not only as a series of debilitating symptoms but also as a profound alteration of the individual's perception of themselves and the world around them. The visitor’s description of feeling like a \"living corpse\" highlights the pervasive sense of disconnection and emotional numbness that characterizes severe depression. This metaphor vividly captures the existential despair that many individuals with depression experience, where life loses its vibrancy, and the future appears devoid of hope.\n\nOne critical aspect of this case is the visitor's experience with medication. While pharmacotherapy can be an essential component of depression treatment, the visitor's feelings of dependency and fear of discontinuation underscore the importance of a comprehensive treatment approach that extends beyond medication alone. This aligns with current best practices, which advocate for a combination of pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions. It is crucial to address the visitor's concerns about medication dependency by fostering a collaborative treatment plan that empowers the patient with knowledge and involves them in decision-making. This might include exploring gradual medication tapering schedules while simultaneously reinforcing coping strategies through cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).\n\nThe case also highlights several psychological factors contributing to the visitor's depressive state, including excessive worry, lack of confidence, avoidance of challenges, and perfectionism. These cognitive and behavioral patterns not only exacerbate depressive symptoms but also perpetuate a cycle of negativity and helplessness. In this context, CBT's role in challenging and restructuring these maladaptive thought patterns is pivotal. By helping the visitor recognize and reframe negative thoughts, CBT can facilitate a shift towards more adaptive and realistic thinking, ultimately reducing the emotional burden of depression.\n\nFurthermore, the visitor's tendency to internalize problems and refrain from seeking help underscores the critical role of social support in mental health. Encouraging open communication with trusted individuals can alleviate feelings of isolation and provide emotional relief. Family and friends can act as buffers against stress, offering reassurance and encouragement. Therapeutically, it is vital to work on the visitor’s interpersonal skills and assertiveness to enable more effective help-seeking behaviors.\n\nThe exploration of lifestyle modifications, such as engaging in physical exercise, listening to music, and participating in activities, is another cornerstone of depression management. Exercise, in particular, has been shown to have antidepressant effects by enhancing endorphin production and reducing stress hormones. Encouraging the visitor to integrate regular physical activity into their routine could provide significant mood benefits and serve as a non-pharmacological strategy to manage depression.\n\nMoreover, this case sheds light on the visitor's struggle with perfectionism and the resultant stress from unmet high standards. Perfectionism can be a double-edged sword, driving achievement but also contributing to persistent dissatisfaction and self-criticism. Therapeutic interventions can focus on setting realistic goals, accepting imperfections, and recognizing accomplishments, no matter how small. This approach can gradually shift the focus from an unattainable ideal to a more balanced and compassionate self-view.\n\nThe role of nutrition in managing depression, while often overlooked, is also noteworthy. Ensuring an adequate intake of B vitamins and other nutrients can support brain health and potentially alleviate some depressive symptoms. This emphasizes the need for a holistic approach that considers physical health and lifestyle factors alongside psychological interventions.\n\nThe visitor's account of fearing the loss of their job and the subsequent financial instability reveals the significant impact of socio-economic factors on mental health. This insight underscores the importance of addressing external stressors and providing practical support and resources to mitigate these challenges. Social services, financial counseling, and vocational rehabilitation can be integral components of a comprehensive treatment plan.\n\nReflecting on the broader societal context, the case illustrates the stigma and lack of awareness surrounding depression, which can hinder individuals from seeking timely help. Public education campaigns and destigmatization efforts are crucial in promoting understanding and acceptance of mental health issues. By fostering a culture that supports mental well-being, individuals are more likely to access the resources and support they need.\n\nIn conclusion, this case exemplifies the complex interplay of cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and socio-economic factors in depression. Effective treatment necessitates a nuanced and individualized approach that integrates pharmacological, psychotherapeutic, and lifestyle interventions. As clinicians, it is our responsibility to provide empathetic, informed, and comprehensive care that empowers individuals to overcome the challenges of depression and reclaim their lives. By fostering resilience and hope, we can support our patients in navigating their journey toward recovery and well-being.", "causes": "Depression due to major stressful events (fear of unemployment and the ensuing economic crisis).", "symptoms": "Insomnia, decreased appetite and libido, slow thinking, emotional numbness.", "treatment_process": "Listening and empathy techniques: allow the visitor to feel accepted and understood, and to safely explore their emotions;\n Cognitive-behavioral therapy: by allowing visitors to identify and challenge their irrational beliefs and shift to a more adaptive and realistic way of thinking, the emotional burden of depression is ultimately reduced.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Existential despair experienced by the visitor, i.e., life is de-energized and the future seems hopeless.", "treatment_effect": "Through treatment, the visitor gradually recovers social functioning and maintains a normal order of life through a combination of external support, rebuilding of inner energy, medication and physical exercise, and active integration into society."}

Currently, they have been living apart for two months!"], "consultation_process": ["Consultation objective: The visitor stated that her boyfriend has probably met someone else, his temper has become very irritable, he doesn't want to talk to her when she seeks him out, and he even becomes physically aggressive. She is unsure how to cope with this situation.", "3. Consultation Process: At first, the client did not want a voice consultation and preferred to communicate through text, which I agreed to. However, I was unsure whether it was her slow thinking or slow typing. After half an hour, I still hadn't gathered her basic information, so I suggested switching to a voice consultation. After making the change, the client spoke very little. She had been with her boyfriend for nearly two years and they had been living together for six months. Three months ago, the boyfriend suddenly changed from being very compliant to becoming irritable, which made the client suspicious! One day, while her boyfriend was away, she secretly checked his phone and found chat records with another woman. She immediately concluded that his irritability was due to someone else. The boyfriend neither admitted nor defended himself, which the client found unacceptable. After all, they had known each other for two years, were about to get married, and had even prepared a car, a house, and the betrothal gifts! The client was reluctant to let go of the marriage, but her way of dealing with it was to cry and throw tantrums. The more she did this, the harsher he became in his words; when she argued back, he resorted to violence. His words became increasingly cruel, and she couldn't help but cry. Eventually, they separated, and it has been two months since. The boyfriend was also suffering, experiencing insomnia and anxiety, and the client often couldn't sleep at night, feeling mentally overwhelmed! At the beginning of their separation, the boyfriend had attempted several times to have sexual relations with the client, but she refused. This only made their relationship more distant, although they did not break up, and he still took her out to dinner every week. The client mentioned that initially, the boyfriend was very accommodating and gave a lot, but when she wanted to contribute, he would avoid it (why?). The client expressed her hope that the boyfriend could spend every day with her like before, but once he distanced himself, she became suspicious and anxious. After their conflicts, the client continuously tried to reach out, calling and texting every day, even driving to his workplace to find him, which left him overwhelmed and exhausted. She claimed she spent up to 8 hours a day texting him online, and eventually, he had to block her on WeChat, but she kept sending messages. The client even drove to his company to find him, which made him increasingly resentful, and he told her not to come. He wanted her to understand him, accept him, and give him some space. During the two months of heartbreak, the client stated that she had a mental breakdown, stopped working, and spent her days lying at home, sleeping and watching movies, feeling completely lost!", "4. Personal Analysis: The visitor has unclear interpersonal boundaries, exhibiting separation anxiety, and is suspected to have anxious attachment personality disorder. The visitor desires her boyfriend to be as compliant and unconditional in support as a father is to his daughter, fostering an intimate and inseparable relationship without allowing the male partner any personal space. Whenever she feels the need to create distance, it triggers separation anxiety, leading her to behave like a child, crying, throwing tantrums, and clinging to him. This may be related to the visitor's own personal growth experiences.", "V. Reflection on the success or failure of the counseling objectives: After the counseling session, I reflected on it and felt that this counseling was not successful. We were focused on solving problems, but the current approach did not help the client find confidence and strength; it only assisted the client in addressing the issues.", "In the consultation, I, like the client, only saw the problems and difficulties, and I kept wanting to solve this issue, as if there was only one path in front of us, without seeing other possibilities for resolving the issue, or rather, not focusing on the client as a person!", "Sixth, reflection on the consultation process: However, I feel that this consultation did not go smoothly. Why was it not smooth? I felt that I was led away by the client during the consultation. The client was fixated on trying to win her boyfriend back, desperately pursuing him, even though he was verbally abusive and physically aggressive towards her. Yet, she continued to wait in anguish, and her mental state was on the verge of collapse! Meanwhile, I was also struggling to help her find solutions. The exploration of the client's issues was laborious; what was supposed to be an hour-long session stretched into an hour and a half without resolution, and the client was still looking to me for answers, unwilling to engage in self-reflection. I thought to myself, isn't her boyfriend being emotionally held captive by her? In the end, I had no choice but to call a halt and suggested we discuss it further the next day. The following day, I scheduled a 20-minute case summary with the client, which felt quite productive. The client began to engage in self-reflection and awareness.", "7. Effect of this consultation: Through this consultation, her reflection is: I have a relatively irritable temper. Her evaluation of this consultation is: I don't feel much, just a sense of helplessness; you have no good solutions, and neither do I!", "8. Homework: None", "9. Issues that need supervision: None.", "Ten, situation analysis: None."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on this consultation, I am struck by the profound learning that emerged around the concepts of transference and countertransference. As I delved deeper into these dynamics, I recognized that while the session initially felt unproductive, it offered a fertile ground for significant professional growth and insight. The awareness I gained about my own reactions, alongside the client's behavior, has been instrumental in enhancing my understanding of these complex therapeutic interactions.\n\nTransference, as we know, is a cornerstone of psychoanalytic theory. It occurs when clients project emotions and expectations rooted in past relationships onto the therapist. In this case, the client seemed to bring into our sessions a set of expectations and emotional reactions that mirrored her tumultuous relationship with her boyfriend. Her relentless pursuit of answers and a resolution—despite the evident destructiveness of her relationship—suggested a deep-seated pattern of attachment and emotional dependency. This pattern, likely stemming from earlier life experiences, was projected onto me, as she sought not just solutions but perhaps unconsciously the validation and emotional support that had been elusive in her current relationship.\n\nInterestingly, as the sessions unfolded, I became increasingly aware of my own emotional responses—what Freud referred to as countertransference. Initially, I noticed a subtle irritation and a desire to push back against the client's seemingly irrational persistence. This reaction was perplexing, as it was not typical of my therapeutic style, which tends to lean towards patience and empathy. However, upon reflection, it became clear that my irritation was a mirror to the client's own unresolved emotional turmoil and her boyfriend's reported irritability. This realization was a breakthrough in understanding how her patterns of interaction could evoke similar responses in different relationships, including the therapeutic one.\n\nIn clinical practice, countertransference can indeed be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it can cloud judgment and lead to less effective therapeutic interventions if left unchecked. On the other, when recognized and explored, it provides invaluable insights into the client's relational dynamics and inner world. My awareness of my own countertransference allowed me to step back and consider what about the client's behavior and communication style was triggering these responses in me. It forced me to confront the possibility that her boyfriend's irritability and aggression might also be a reaction to feeling emotionally overwhelmed and trapped by her persistent demands for reassurance and connection.\n\nThe client's history, as revealed in our sessions, suggested an anxious attachment style—a pattern often characterized by fear of abandonment and an intense need for closeness and reassurance. Such individuals may inadvertently push partners away with their demands, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy where their greatest fear—rejection—becomes a reality. This insight was crucial, as it shifted my focus from merely solving the client's immediate issues to understanding the underlying emotional needs driving her behavior. It became apparent that the client's attempts to control her boyfriend's actions and feelings stemmed from a deep-seated fear of loss, likely exacerbated by previous relational traumas or unmet needs during formative years.\n\nThroughout the consultation, I observed how the client's communication style—marked by an urgency and intensity—seemed to mirror the chaos she described in her relationship. Her manner of speaking, often rapid and emotionally charged, suggested a mind in turmoil, desperately seeking stability and certainty. This mirrored the tumultuous pattern of interaction with her boyfriend, where her attempts to reestablish connection often resulted in further conflict and emotional distancing. This recognition was pivotal in understanding how her unresolved emotional conflicts were playing out both in her personal life and within the therapeutic setting.\n\nAs I continued to reflect on these dynamics, I considered the potential impact of her early life experiences. The client's desire for her boyfriend to act in an unconditional, supportive role, akin to a parental figure, hinted at possible gaps in her emotional development or unmet needs in her family of origin. Such insights highlighted the importance of exploring the client's past to uncover how early relationships may have shaped her current attachment style and relational expectations. This exploration could potentially unlock new pathways for healing and growth, allowing the client to form healthier, more balanced relationships.\n\nIn terms of therapeutic technique, this case underscored the value of narrative therapy in helping clients reframe their stories and gain a sense of agency. However, the client's initial resistance to self-reflection and her focus on external solutions suggested a need for more foundational work around self-awareness and emotional regulation. By integrating elements of mindfulness and cognitive-behavioral approaches, we could potentially support the client in developing the skills necessary to manage her anxiety and build a more secure sense of self, independent of her relationship status.\n\nMoreover, this case has reinforced the necessity of professional supervision in dealing with complex emotional dynamics. Engaging with a supervisor provides a safe space to explore one's own emotional reactions and gain a clearer perspective on the client's needs. In this instance, discussing my countertransference with a supervisor could offer additional insights and strategies for managing these feelings constructively within the therapeutic process. It also emphasizes the importance of continuous professional development and self-reflection in maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of therapeutic work.\n\nUltimately, while the consultation did not achieve the immediate objectives set out at the beginning, it provided a profound learning experience that will undoubtedly inform my future practice. By embracing the discomfort and uncertainty that arose, I have gained a deeper understanding of the intricate interplay between transference and countertransference and their potential to both hinder and enhance the therapeutic process. Moving forward, I am committed to cultivating a greater awareness of these dynamics and using them as a tool for fostering deeper therapeutic connections and facilitating meaningful change for my clients.", "causes": "Unmet emotional needs in childhood", "symptoms": "Anxious Attachment Personality Disorder suspected to be present", "treatment_process": "Communication was blocked at the beginning of the counseling, and then strategies were adjusted by analyzing the attachment pattern, guiding the visitor's self-reflection, and the counselor detected and dealt with countertransference, which facilitated the deepening of the treatment.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Blurred interpersonal boundaries, severe separation anxiety", "treatment_effect": "After one counseling session, the visitor began to reflect on her own irritable temper, but her evaluation of the counseling effect was not high, and the counseling did not reach the expected goal, but there was a preliminary effect of self-awareness."}

In their exchanges, they learned about each other's family and marital status, realizing that both had been married for many years and had a 7-year-old son, and that each other's lives were relatively good. They also reminisced about their past feelings and relationships, feeling a bit regretful about how things turned out. Although they once shared a deep love and felt a sense of loss from their abrupt breakup, Ms. Chen was relatively content; they were just chatting and had not engaged in any emotional infidelity. They browsed each other's social media posts, keeping up with each other's lives, and occasionally felt that the other was hinting at nostalgia for their beautiful past and love. However, Ms. Zhang remained unaffected. Recently, for some unknown reason, about a month ago, Ms. Zhang inexplicably found herself frequently dreaming about being with her ex-boyfriend, sometimes in ambiguous situations, sometimes engaging in intimate behaviors, and at times feeling a strange sense of love for each other in her dreams, as if they truly still loved one another and wanted to be together.", "Often after waking up, Ms. Zhang feels that this seems wrong; although it was just a dream, she feels guilty towards her husband. It's a bit strange, and in the following period, even though she doesn't dream about him every day, she finds herself dreaming of him from time to time. The more Ms. Zhang tries to suppress her thoughts, the more she thinks about it in reality. Moreover, sometimes when she is intimate with her husband, she can't help but wonder what it would be like if her current husband were her ex-boyfriend...", "Afterwards, Ms. Zhang increasingly felt her own filth and the dirtiness of her mind, and she was also worried that she was not just thinking about cheating, but about her ex-boyfriend, which made her anxious and conflicted.", "Consultation process:", "1. First, listen to the visitor's detailed description of her dream. Many times, the visitor herself says that the scenarios in the dream are actually more like fantasies she had after the breakup, wishing for a romantic connection with her ex-boyfriend. In fact, Ms. Zhang met her ex-boyfriend while she was still in school, and their relationship was very pure and innocent at that time, characterized as a secret romance known only to the two of them. The most intimate actions were just kissing and hugging. Later, they went to different vocational schools, which interrupted their passionate love. Perhaps because her ex-boyfriend was not proactive, over time, their initial enthusiasm faded, and they eventually broke up. After that, the visitor met her current husband, who is the first man she truly feels love for. After dating for five years, they got married and had children. Their life is not particularly happy, but it’s manageable because her husband treats her fairly well.", "The deep psychological analysis behind dreams:", "Through guidance and deep exploration, it is actually discovered that Ms. Zhang's true love is not her ex-boyfriend. The recurring scenes of her ex-boyfriend in her dreams and the seemingly close and ambiguous feelings towards him arise because he is, after all, her first love. Although their love was never passionate, it was the purest and most beautiful first love in her life. What is lost and what has never been possessed always leads to longing and yearning. Many years later, when they reconnect through WeChat and learn about each other's family and marital details through moments shared online, there is a feeling of a bittersweet heartache. This is especially true because in the visitor's current marital situation, the long-standing marriage seems to have lost its initial passion, and her husband does not seem to be as attentive as during their courtship, which leaves the visitor feeling disappointed. As she gradually re-establishes contact with her naive first love, memories of what seems like a romance akin to a hawthorn tree love story slowly resurface in her mind. This may subconsciously compensate for her sense of unhappiness in reality, leading her to imagine how their love story would unfold if she had been with her ex-boyfriend. Over time, this will fulfill her romantic fantasies about the once broken first love in her dreams.", "In other words, the recurring appearances of the ex-boyfriend in the dream are merely a compensation for the visitor's dissatisfaction with their current marriage and family situation; at the same time, it is also a romantic fantasy in the subconscious, yearning for what might have been if the first love had not ended so abruptly.", "Solution:", "1. Guide the visitor to discover their dissatisfaction with their current marriage and family. It turns out that what the visitor is dissatisfied with is the lack of passion in the marriage over time, and the husband seems to no longer put in the effort to please as he did during their courtship. As a result, the visitor feels a sense of disappointment and wishes for her husband to better express himself about the trivial matters in life and work, as well as to spend more time with her and their child.", "2. Guide the visitor to truly reflect on their feelings and emotions towards their first love and their ex-boyfriend. Through continuous consultation, discussion, and assigning homework, help the visitor think about how they have always felt reluctant about the abrupt end of that pure first love. They may also have resentment towards their ex-boyfriend for not making an effort to stay together during their first love, feeling a sense of superiority now as if marrying someone else is happier than choosing that ex-boyfriend at the time, while in reality, there seems to be a gap between that feeling of superiority and actual reality.", "3. Guide the visitor to truly understand the emotions of reality and the past, helping them realize that their current family and marriage, as well as the husband they have chosen, are more suitable for them. The past first love and ex-boyfriend are merely remnants of the past, like a dream, not real. Conduct a simulated dialogue to have a deep farewell with the first love and the ex-boyfriend.", "Consultation Effect:", "After several consultations, the visitor, under my guidance, gradually expressed dissatisfaction with reality and a lingering attachment to their first love through the description of dreams. They realized that it was merely a romantic fantasy created by dreams to compensate for their dissatisfaction with reality and to cherish beautiful memories of their first love.", "2. It also helps the visitor understand that the present is actually the best, and guides them to learn to communicate more with their husband to resolve real dissatisfaction; using a simulated dialogue of \"what I want to say to you\" to bring an emotional farewell to their first love and ex-boyfriend.", "After the consultation, it was found that the visitor had completely let go of the naive feelings for her ex-boyfriend. She no longer dreams about him and does not think of him when being intimate with her husband. At the same time, she has learned to communicate with her husband in real life, which has strengthened their marital relationship."], "experience_and_reflection": "In the realm of psychotherapy, dreams often serve as a profound gateway into the depths of our subconscious, revealing hidden desires, unresolved conflicts, and emotional undercurrents that may not be readily apparent in our waking life. Ms. Zhang's case exemplifies the intricate tapestry woven by dreams and subconscious musings, particularly when they involve past relationships and unfulfilled emotional needs.\n\nAt the outset, Ms. Zhang's recurring dreams about her ex-boyfriend were troubling for her. They were not just simple, fleeting dreams; they carried a weight, a sense of ambiguity and emotional complexity that compelled her to seek clarity through professional consultation. The dreams were marked by scenarios that suggested intimacy and affection, elements that starkly contrasted with her current marital reality, which she described as acceptable but lacking the fervor and attentiveness that characterized the early stages of her relationship with her husband.\n\nDelving deeper into Ms. Zhang's subconscious, it became evident that these dreams were not mere remnants of her past relationship but rather a manifestation of her subconscious dissatisfaction with her current marital situation. Her marriage, although stable, seemed to have settled into a routine devoid of the passion and excitement that she once cherished. This realization brought to light a critical aspect of human psychology: the yearning for emotional fulfillment and the romanticization of what might have been.\n\nDream interpretation techniques provided a valuable framework for understanding the subconscious motivations behind Ms. Zhang's dreams. Dreams, by nature, are symbolic and often represent our deepest fears, desires, and unresolved emotions. Ms. Zhang's dreams of her ex-boyfriend were not an indication of lingering romantic feelings towards him but rather a symbolic representation of her longing for a more passionate and emotionally fulfilling relationship. This longing was amplified by the reconnection with her ex-boyfriend through social media, which served as a catalyst for her subconscious mind to explore these unmet emotional needs.\n\nThe therapeutic process involved guiding Ms. Zhang to confront and articulate her feelings regarding her marriage and her past relationship. Through this exploration, it became clear that her ex-boyfriend represented the innocence and purity of first love, a time when emotions were raw and unencumbered by the complexities of adult life. Her subconscious was yearning for that simplicity and emotional connection, which she perceived as lacking in her current relationship.\n\nA pivotal aspect of the therapy was helping Ms. Zhang differentiate between the fantasy of her dreams and the reality of her emotions. The dreams were a form of compensation for her dissatisfaction, a subconscious attempt to recreate the emotional fulfillment she was missing. By recognizing this, Ms. Zhang was able to address the root cause of her dreams — her dissatisfaction with her current marital dynamics.\n\nThrough guided reflection, Ms. Zhang learned to appreciate the aspects of her marriage that were positive and nurturing. She was encouraged to communicate openly with her husband about her needs and desires, fostering a deeper emotional connection that could rejuvenate their relationship. This process was akin to a therapeutic awakening, enabling her to reconcile her subconscious fantasies with her conscious reality.\n\nThe simulated dialogue technique proved invaluable in helping Ms. Zhang bid farewell to the emotional remnants of her first love. By engaging in a metaphorical conversation with her ex-boyfriend, she was able to release the emotional hold he had on her subconscious, acknowledging that the past was an integral part of her journey but not a determinant of her present happiness.\n\nReflecting on the case, it becomes evident that dreams can serve as a mirror to our innermost feelings, revealing truths that we may not be consciously aware of. Ms. Zhang's experience underscores the importance of understanding dreams as a tool for psychological insight and emotional healing. They offer a unique perspective on our subconscious mind, providing clues to unresolved issues and unmet needs.\n\nThe resolution of Ms. Zhang's case highlights the therapeutic potential of dream interpretation in fostering emotional growth and self-awareness. By addressing her subconscious dissatisfaction and guiding her towards open communication and emotional expression, Ms. Zhang was able to transform her relationship with her husband, cultivating a renewed sense of intimacy and fulfillment.\n\nIn conclusion, the exploration of Ms. Zhang's dreams served as a profound journey into the depths of her subconscious, revealing the intricate interplay between past experiences and present emotional needs. Her case illustrates the transformative power of psychotherapy in helping individuals navigate the complexities of their inner world, ultimately leading to greater self-awareness and emotional harmony. Dreams, when understood and analyzed, can serve as a powerful catalyst for personal growth, offering insights that pave the way for a more fulfilling and authentic life.", "causes": "Subconscious compensation triggered by fading marital passion and unfinished first love.", "symptoms": "Frequent dreams of ex-boyfriends and complex emotions.", "treatment_process": "guiding the exploration of subconscious needs, reflecting on the emotions of the first love, communicating with the husband, simulating a dialog to say goodbye to the first love.", "characteristics_of_illness": "dissatisfaction with reality and romantic fantasies about first love are intertwined", "treatment_effect": "After four counseling sessions, she successfully let go of her emotions and improved her marriage relationship."}
{"id": 153, "case_description": ["The case study subject, Congcong (pseudonym), is a male local resident born in October 2002. He started attending the first grade at this school in September 2009 and was diagnosed with intellectual disability by Hangzhou Seventh People's Hospital. In the first grade, Congcong would often walk around or lie on the floor making strange noises during class, and he would throw his stationery on the ground. After class, he would randomly take things from classmates and teachers, displaying aggressive behavior towards both. Sometimes, he would pick up things from the classroom trash can to eat, drink water that dripped from the mop, defecate and urinate anywhere, and eat with his hands. He requires his parents to accompany him to and from school."], "consultation_process": ["1. Assessment and Diagnosis\n   1. Preliminary Assessment\n   The first assessment (before the project initiation in early December 2011) was conducted through observations of Congcong's daily educational activities and relevant project tests. This was combined with interviews with his parents, grandmother (main caregiver), class teacher, other subject teachers, and resource teachers to collect information on the child's personal data, family background, pathological causes, sensory integration scale assessments, checklists, and individual evaluations.\n\n   2. Diagnostic Analysis\n   Based on Congcong's basic information and relevant medical certificates, it was found that his primary disabilities are coordination disorders, balance dysfunction, spatial perception disorders, and speech and language disorders. The assessment according to the \"Children's Sensory Integration Development Assessment Scale\" indicated that Congcong has moderate vestibular dysfunction, mild tactile defensiveness, severe proprioceptive dysfunction, severe learning disabilities, and sensory integration dysfunction. Results from the eyes-closed single-leg standing test and eyes-closed standing test showed that Congcong has poor body balance control, which is one of the core issues of his sensory integration dysfunction. From the perspective of pathological causes and family information, Congcong's intellectual disability and sensory integration dysfunction symptoms appear to have significant correlations with genetic factors and family educational environment.\n\n2. Course Design\n   Based on the initial assessment results, and considering the resources available in the school's resource classroom and gym, as well as Congcong's sensory integration dysfunction characteristics, the two teachers in the project team decided to focus on strengthening Congcong's proprioceptive and vestibular function training, while also conducting comprehensive training in tactile, balance, and high-low position integration. The main designed training projects include:\n   1. Proprioceptive training projects: standing jumps on two feet, walking in a straight line, throwing and catching balls, building blocks, hoop stacking, and basketball shooting.\n   2. Vestibular function training projects: sliding down ramps, rolling sideways while lying down, human weebles, sudden start and stop, spinning, and walking on balance beams.\n   3. Comprehensive training projects: kicking shuttlecocks, playing badminton, jumping rope, basic gymnastics, and table tennis activities.\n\n3. Course Implementation\n   In the 2011 academic year, aside from the pre-assessment period (September to November, during which spontaneous sensory integration training was conducted) and the winter and summer vacations, the actual time for targeted sensory integration training courses was from December 2011 to June 2012, totaling six months. This training was primarily conducted by Teacher Wen, who has long been engaged in elementary school physical education. Additionally, I incorporated some sensory integration training projects into weekly lessons focusing on Congcong's behavior etiquette, attention training, memory training, confidence building, and emotional counseling, while also organizing relevant implementation course discussion activities.\n\n4. Reassessment\n   1. Qualitative Evaluation\n   To assess the effectiveness of the course implementation, at the end of June 2012, the two teachers in the project team conducted a qualitative evaluation based on daily teaching observations and records. They unanimously agreed that Congcong showed significant improvement in civility and learning habits, communication with teachers and classmates became smoother than before, he developed an interest in learning, and his agility and coordination improved. He could sustain participation in certain training activities, such as playing badminton, shooting basketballs, and sliding on boards, for longer periods. Notably, his two-handed basketball shooting ability was better than many students in the same grade, showing considerable strength and a high shooting percentage.\n\n   2. Quantitative Evaluation\n   (1) \"Children's Sensory Integration Development Assessment Scale\" Evaluation\n   In conjunction with the first assessment's \"Children's Sensory Integration Development Assessment Scale,\" we reassessed Congcong's vestibular function, tactile function, proprioceptive ability, learning disabilities, and issues related to older children. The results showed: mild vestibular dysfunction, normal tactile function, severe proprioceptive dysfunction, severe learning disabilities, and the problems associated with older children remained serious. Statistical results compared to the previous assessment indicated significant improvements in vestibular and tactile functions, confirming the effectiveness of the training. Further enhancement of proprioceptive, vestibular, and fine motor training is still required, alongside consolidation of tactile training.\n\n   (2) \"Children's Sensory Integration Ability Checklist\" (2012 Edition) Conversion Assessment\n   To refine the evaluation, we performed a sensory integration ability conversion assessment on Congcong using the \"Children's Sensory Integration Ability Checklist\" (2012 Edition), which includes seven major areas and 64 items focusing on vestibular balance and bilateral differentiation of the brain. The statistical results indicated that Congcong still exhibited sensory integration dysfunction, with severity ranked from high to low: developmental motor disorders, visual spatial forms, proprioception, emotional responses to work pressure, difficulties in brain neurophysiological inhibition, vestibular balance, and bilateral brain differentiation. Tactile defensiveness was excessive, while responses were insufficient but showed room for improvement.\n\n5. Adjustments and Improvements\n   Based on the results of the three assessments, the initial training was effective but the results were not very pronounced. We consulted with provincial and municipal experts on sensory integration training, who suggested that the training curriculum should further emphasize fine motor skills training, increase the training volume, and introduce additional training aids. Consequently, we made the following adjustments and improvements to Congcong's sensory integration training:\n   1. Adjust the Class Teacher\n   Although the original class teacher, who had significant educational experience and provided special care for Congcong during the first and second grades, was not sufficient from the perspective of sensory integration training. In the 2012 academic year, Congcong's class teacher was replaced by Teacher Shou, who had years of experience in physical education, specialized in mental health education, and had substantial experience in educating children with special educational needs. She also took on remedial Chinese language instruction in the resource classroom. Congcong's math and physical education classes were taught by a young, caring, physically strong Teacher Fang, with other subject teachers also undergoing various adjustments.\n\n   2. Add Sensory Integration Training Equipment\n   Our resource classroom originally had limited sensory integration training equipment and offered a narrow range of training projects. To enhance training effectiveness, the school collaborated with a professional manufacturer through the Hangzhou Special Education Center to procure approximately 20,000 yuan worth of specialized sensory integration training equipment.\n\n   3. Increase Training Sessions and Volume\n   In the 2012 academic year, the school resource classroom adjusted the total of 10 class hours by increasing sensory integration training from one hour to two hours per week. Both I and Teacher Wen each took one hour, and we required the physical education teacher accompanying Congcong to pay special attention to the three hours of physical education classes each week, as well as requiring the class teacher and co-teachers to impose training requirements during the 40 minutes of recess each day.\n\n   4. Develop a New Training Curriculum\n   Team members, in conjunction with expert guidance and new equipment, formulated a new and more targeted sensory integration training plan for Congcong, utilizing 20 types of sensory integration tools and 120 training methods to adjust Congcong's vestibular, proprioceptive, and tactile information input to promote his neural development.\n\n   5. Involve Family Members in Training Tasks\n   Congcong spends time at home after school, on weekends, and during holidays and is unable to participate in specialized sensory integration training. Therefore, we communicated with Congcong's parents, requesting their assistance with some simple and feasible sensory integration training tasks, such as jumping rope, walking in a straight line, jumping with both feet off the ground, cutting squares with scissors, and picking up beans with chopsticks. The parents were able to cooperate actively.\n\n6. Overall Evaluation\n   At the end of January 2013, members of our project team, the accompanying class teacher, and parents conducted a sensory integration checklist and a comparison of the eyes-closed single-leg standing test and eyes-closed standing test for an overall evaluation of Congcong.\n   1. Sensory Integration Checklist Results Comparison\n   The first three items on the \"Children's Sensory Integration Ability Checklist\" (2012 Edition) showed significant improvement before and after training, reaching normal or near-normal levels. The fourth and fifth items also showed clear improvement, but still indicated severe dysfunction. The last three items demonstrated significant improvement as well, but still had considerable room for enhancement.\n\n   2. Comparison of Eyes-Closed Single-Leg Standing Test and Eyes-Closed Standing Test\n   A comparison of Congcong's eyes-closed single-leg standing test and eyes-closed standing test showed no significant changes before and after training in the single-leg standing test, while the standing test showed significant progress, indicating a substantial improvement in Congcong's balance ability.\n\nMain Achievements\n   After more than a year of research focused on Congcong's sensory integration training, there were clear achievements.\n   1. Promoting Individual Growth and Development\n   This research promoted Congcong's growth and development, specifically reflected in improvements in his vestibular, tactile, proprioceptive, and learning abilities. His attention increased, he accumulated positive psychological experiences, and his self-esteem and confidence improved. Aggressive behaviors significantly decreased, and his negative interpersonal relationships improved. Classmates no longer feared him and sometimes played simple games with him. Parents no longer requested to transfer their children to different classes. Class teachers and subject teachers reported that Congcong was more compliant with classroom teaching order than before. Congcong became increasingly focused during classes in the resource classroom. In remedial Chinese language classes, he was able to copy words and phrases seriously, with handwriting becoming neater. During reading exercises, his voice was loud, and his pronunciation was clearer than before. In remedial math classes, he carefully verified each problem and was able to ask questions whenever he encountered difficulties. Congcong became more considerate, proactively greeting teachers and classmates before class, saying \"goodbye\" afterward, and helping to fetch water, mop the floor, and organize teaching aids and learning tools during breaks.\n\n   2. Improving Sensory Integration Training Curriculum System\n   Throughout this research process, we accumulated a wealth of related course plans and implementation strategies, initially forming a sensory integration training curriculum system for children with intellectual disabilities who study alongside their peers, divided into tactile, vestibular, proprioceptive, fine motor, and balance training courses. Specific training projects include: walking in a straight line, rolling sideways while lying down, sliding down ramps in a prone position, identifying body parts, human weebles, kicking shuttlecocks, playing badminton, jumping rope, basic gymnastics, table tennis activities, basketball activities, throwing solid balls, jumping with both feet off the ground, cutting squares with scissors, and picking up beans with chopsticks. The curriculum projects can be randomly combined for the implementation of sensory integration training for relevant cases.\n\n   3. Promoting the Growth and Development of the Professional Team\n   In the process of collecting data, assessing cases, designing courses, implementing courses, and coordinating resources, team members, resource teachers, accompanying class teachers, and subject teachers supported each other, jointly promoting the rehabilitation of children with special educational needs while fostering the growth and development of the professional team members.\n\n   4. Promoting the Growth and Development of Parents\n   During the research process, I learned that there were tensions between some family members of Congcong, and I provided family education guidance. For the sake of Congcong's healthy development, family members were able to put aside past grievances and jointly create a positive family education atmosphere. Congcong's parents and grandmother were able to reflect on and adjust their behaviors in a timely manner, primarily guiding Congcong's education with positive reinforcement. To allow Congcong to study comfortably alongside his peers, his father could visit the school during his work breaks and conduct relevant sensory integration training at home. Congcong's parents also experienced personal growth."], "experience_and_reflection": "1. Sensory integration training has a profound and multifaceted significance in the educational and developmental trajectory of children with intellectual disabilities. At its core, sensory integration training addresses the fundamental building blocks of cognitive activities: attention, organization, and comprehension. These activities are deeply rooted in sensation, which serves as the foundation upon which all cognitive processes are built. When the brain struggles to process sensory information accurately, it leads to a range of challenges, including learning difficulties, physical coordination problems, and emotional dysregulation. Sensory integration training aims to recalibrate these neural processes through carefully structured sensory inputs, fostering brain development that enhances learning outcomes and emotional stability.\n\nIn reflecting on Congcong's case, it becomes clear that sensory integration training does not merely serve as an adjunct to educational strategies but is an integral component of a comprehensive approach to supporting children with intellectual disabilities. These children, often dealing with both primary impairments and secondary complications, exhibit underdeveloped sensory integration abilities. The severity of their disabilities correlates with the degree of sensory integration dysfunction, making targeted intervention crucial. Through this case, I observed how sensory integration training transcends traditional educational boundaries, offering a holistic methodology that significantly improves sensory processing, motor skills, cognitive function, and emotional health.\n\nCongcong's journey underscores the transformative impact of such training. Over time, we observed marked improvements not only in his sensory processing capabilities but also in his overall demeanor and interactions. His aggression diminished, and his social interactions improved, reflecting a newfound ability to engage with his peers and environment positively. This case reaffirms that sensory integration training is not merely beneficial but essential for fostering the holistic development of children with intellectual disabilities.\n\n2. The success of sensory integration training hinges on multi-party collaboration, a principle vividly illustrated throughout Congcong's journey. While the training itself is a powerful tool for rehabilitation, its effectiveness is amplified through coordinated efforts among educators, therapists, and family members. The case of Congcong highlights the necessity of creating a supportive ecosystem where school leaders, class teachers, subject teachers, and resource teachers are all actively engaged in the child's development. This collaborative approach ensures that the training extends beyond the confines of structured sessions and permeates the child's daily interactions, both at school and at home.\n\nIn practice, we found that the psychological benefits of sensory integration training were significantly enhanced through the involvement of parents and family members. The shared experiences of progress and the collective joy of achievement foster a nurturing environment that supports the child's potential and quality of life. Congcong's parents, initially apprehensive about the training, became enthusiastic participants, incorporating sensory integration activities into their daily routines. This involvement not only reinforced the training's impact but also strengthened family bonds and created a more harmonious home environment conducive to Congcong's development.\n\nMoreover, the case highlights the importance of equipping educators with the necessary skills and knowledge to effectively support sensory integration training. This includes specialized training for teachers in recognizing and addressing sensory integration dysfunctions, as well as ongoing professional development opportunities to refine their approaches. Through the collaborative efforts of all stakeholders, we were able to create a dynamic and responsive educational environment that maximized Congcong's rehabilitation potential.\n\n3. Sensory integration training is a time-intensive endeavor, requiring patience, persistence, and a long-term commitment from all involved parties. The gradual nature of progress in Congcong's case serves as a poignant reminder that the path to rehabilitation is often a marathon rather than a sprint. The improvements observed in his balance and coordination, while significant, were the result of sustained effort over an extended period. This slow yet steady progress underscores the necessity of setting realistic expectations and maintaining a consistent training regimen.\n\nThe experience with Congcong also highlights the need for adaptability and continuous assessment in sensory integration training. As his abilities evolved, we frequently revisited and adjusted the training curriculum to better align with his changing needs. This iterative process was crucial in ensuring that the training remained relevant and effective, allowing us to address new challenges as they arose and capitalize on emerging strengths.\n\nFurthermore, the case emphasizes the importance of integrating sensory integration training into the broader educational framework. By embedding sensory activities into regular classroom routines and extracurricular activities, we were able to reinforce the training's objectives and provide Congcong with continuous opportunities for sensory and cognitive engagement. This holistic approach not only accelerated his progress but also facilitated his integration into the school community, fostering a sense of belonging and acceptance.\n\nIn conclusion, the case of Congcong illustrates the profound impact of sensory integration training on children with intellectual disabilities. Through a combination of structured interventions, collaborative efforts, and a commitment to long-term development, we were able to support Congcong's growth in multiple dimensions. The insights gained from this experience reaffirm the importance of sensory integration training as a cornerstone of educational and therapeutic strategies for children with special needs.

{"id": 154, "case_description": ["Visitor, successful career, long-term resident in Beijing, renowned writer and painter, career development bottleneck, wife suffers from bipolar disorder and needs to be hospitalized."], "consultation_process": ["In the spring of 2012, I received a message on my blog from someone wanting to meet for a consultation. Due to the person's special identity, we arranged to meet on a Sunday. He appeared slightly tired and clearly troubled. Upon meeting, he immediately told me that I had a trustworthy demeanor and was curious about my profession, believing I could help him resolve long-standing family issues. Usually, I prefer to get straight to the point in my therapy sessions without much small talk. I asked him to close his eyes and relax for a while, listening to some music to clear his mind. After a while, he dejectedly shared that he was currently at a bottleneck in his career. A book he had worked hard on for ten years was being sold on a well-known website, and he wanted to self-fund a third edition. He hoped to hold a press conference, but his funding partner had suddenly pulled out. He had been severely anxious and sleepless for many days, showing signs of a stroke, and his wife was also causing turmoil at home due to years of conflict. His wife was losing her mind and wanted to enter a psychiatric hospital. I thought that everyone could face difficulties and dead ends, and those inside the situation often lack the clarity of those outside it. For his issues, I first helped him organize a systemic constellation that revealed the bottleneck in his career was tied to the book itself. He needed to put more effort into improving it; if the book was good, funding and promotion would not be a problem, and people would approach him for collaboration. He suddenly realized this and decided to make some modifications to the original version, hoping for better sales. Once we resolved that issue, he let out a sigh of relief and shared another problem: he had been living apart from his wife for years, continually writing and neglecting his family. They had two children; the eldest daughter was in college, and the younger son had just started middle school and was a bit rebellious, often leading to calls from school teachers asking for parental involvement. His wife's mood had been poor, having previously suffered from bipolar disorder, and now she called to say she couldn't take it anymore and wanted to enter a psychiatric hospital. I quickly conducted a family perspective session and found that there had been ongoing discord between him and his wife, with little communication. He was unwilling to be disturbed while writing, while his wife had issues she couldn't discuss, leading her to bottle up her feelings. He had been away from home for years, afraid of family pressures and avoiding confrontation. His wife's hopes had repeatedly been dashed, and she had been bearing burdens beyond what an ordinary person could handle. In this family, the father's and husband's roles were absent, and years of no communication left his wife feeling extremely insecure. Her manic-depressive episodes were not unfounded and had begun to affect their college-aged daughter, who also showed mild depressive tendencies, while their son was acting out rebelliously, skipping school to create trouble in hopes of bringing his father back. After seeing all this, I shared my thoughts, and he fell silent, beginning to reflect. After the initial diagnosis, it was clear that he was deeply affected. He returned to me several times for help in making step-by-step adjustments and planning. As our consultations progressed, we discovered that his current struggles were also overshadowed by a business failure from years ago. Once a millionaire, he had fallen to rock bottom due to an inexplicable lawsuit, and to protect his wife and children, he hadn't explained much, bearing the pressure of failure alone in Beijing. Life had not been easy for him, but his past success made it hard for him to let go of his pride; he didn't want to ask for help or discuss much with his wife. In Beijing, many aspects seemed superficially prosperous, but he was not doing well and had lost interest in commercial competition, turning to literature as a means of escape from past wounds, writing critiques and exposes of current injustices, which I saw as another form of protest against unfairness. I helped him process some trauma, releasing years of repression, and he felt like a new person. Regarding his career, I assisted him in grounding himself in reality, re-planning his life, and understanding that bearing pressure alone and avoiding confrontation caused significant harm to his wife and children. He decided to leave Beijing, where he had struggled for over a decade, and return to his hometown to reunite with his family, comforting and compensating for the absence he had caused, while also revising his work. Six months later, during a follow-up visit, he had developed well in his hometown, receiving attention from the local government and benefits not available in Beijing. He expanded his artistic creations beyond writing, brimming with inspiration, and his wife showed a long-lost smile; their daughter was happy, and their son no longer skipped school or desired to. The family was harmonious and warm, and everything began to evolve positively. He was extremely grateful to me and insisted on giving me 40% equity in his years of work, wanting me to be the spokesperson for his new book promotion. I expressed that I could help him find suitable resources for collaboration but only wished to focus on marriage and family counseling, a career that could illuminate and warm people's lives. In the context of my past life and mission in Hong Kong, this was exactly my purpose. Hehe."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on this case, I am reminded of the profound impact that familial dynamics can have on individual mental health and overall family well-being. The intricate relationship between personal aspirations and family responsibilities often surfaces in therapy, particularly when one member of the family achieves notable success. The journey of the visitor in this case, a prominent writer and artist, underscores the delicate balance between professional accomplishments and familial harmony.\n\nUpon our first meeting, his demeanor revealed the weight of his struggles, both in his career and family life. His initial concerns about the bottleneck in his career led us to explore deeper issues through the lens of Family System Constellations. This therapeutic approach allowed us to uncover how the stagnation in his professional life was mirrored by and perhaps even a result of unresolved familial tensions. As we delved into the constellation, it became apparent that his career challenges were not isolated; they were interwoven with his personal life, particularly the strained relationship with his wife and children.\n\nThe systemic approach of Family Constellations provided a framework to address not only the visible symptoms of distress but also the underlying familial patterns that contributed to these issues. His wife's bipolar disorder, exacerbated by years of emotional neglect, was a focal point. The constellation revealed that her desire for hospitalization was a cry for help and a manifestation of years of unmet emotional needs. The family's dynamic had been skewed by the father's absence, both physically and emotionally, creating a vacuum that each family member felt compelled to fill in maladaptive ways.\n\nThe therapeutic journey highlighted the importance of addressing the roles within the family system. The father's prolonged absence had left a void that contributed to his wife's mental health struggles and affected the children’s development. The eldest daughter's mild depressive tendencies and the son's rebellious behavior were not merely individual issues but symptoms of a dysfunctional family system. This insight allowed the visitor to see the broader impact of his actions and inactions, leading to a profound realization about the necessity of reintegrating into his family life.\n\nAs the sessions progressed, it became clear that his past business failure and the subsequent decision to focus on writing were coping mechanisms to deal with unresolved trauma. The constellation work brought to light how his need to escape from the pressures of his previous life had inadvertently perpetuated a cycle of isolation and disconnection. It was essential for him to understand that his artistic pursuits, while fulfilling, could not substitute for the emotional nourishment that family bonds provide.\n\nThe decision to relocate from Beijing back to his hometown marked a pivotal turning point. This move symbolized a return to his roots and an opportunity to rebuild the familial connections that had been neglected. It also allowed him to redefine success not solely in terms of professional achievement but as the ability to foster a loving and supportive family environment. The transformation observed in his family dynamics post-relocation was a testament to the power of systemic change initiated through therapeutic intervention.\n\nThe follow-up sessions revealed significant improvements in the family's overall well-being. His wife’s mental health showed marked improvement as she received the emotional support she had long been denied. The children's behavioral issues also subsided, reflecting a newfound stability and security in their family life. The visitor's artistic career flourished as he tapped into a wellspring of creativity, no longer burdened by the unresolved past.\n\nThis case reaffirms the vital role of systemic therapy in addressing complex family issues. It demonstrates how understanding the interconnectedness of personal and familial challenges can lead to meaningful and sustainable change. The visitor's journey underscores the necessity of confronting and healing past wounds to create a future where professional success and familial harmony coexist.\n\nIn retrospect, this case has enriched my understanding of the intricate dynamics at play in family systems. It has reinforced the importance of viewing clients as part of a larger relational context and addressing the systemic roots of their struggles. Through this process, clients can achieve not only personal healing but also contribute to the healing of their family system, leading to a ripple effect of positive change.\n\nAs therapists, we are reminded that our role is not just to provide solutions but to guide clients in uncovering the truths within their systems. This process requires patience, empathy, and a deep understanding of the human condition. It is a journey that transforms both the client and the therapist, as we witness the profound capacity for healing and growth inherent in every family system.\n\nThis reflection highlights the enduring wisdom of Family System Constellations and their ability to reveal hidden dynamics and foster healing. It is a testament to the power of this approach to facilitate profound and lasting change, reminding us of the fundamental truth that no success can replace the failure of family.", "causes": "Imbalance between personal ambitions and family responsibilities, focusing on writing and avoiding family problems after business failure", "symptoms": "Career bottleneck, anxiety and insomnia.", "treatment_process": "Through Family System Alignment Therapy, gradually exploring family conflicts, dealing with trauma, guiding him to reintegrate into his family and reorienting his work.", "characteristics_of_illness": "dysfunction of the family system, poor communication among members, emotional neglect and lack of roles.", "treatment_effect": "The overall well-being of the family is significantly enhanced, the psychological health of the members improves, the family relationship is harmonious, and the individual's career also flourishes."}

She reported that she began preparations in August 2016 and co-founded a psychological consulting company with shareholders in December 2016. Subsequently, there was a betrayal by one of the shareholders, which caused serious losses to the company, visitors, other shareholders, and her family. She felt deeply remorseful and regretted her poor decision-making, acknowledging her inability to see the essence of the situation. During her account, her emotions at one point got out of control."], "consultation_process": ["She mainly recounted several incidents that caused her severe psychological trauma: 1. Before their collaboration, this shareholder was her visitor. He came for consultation because his child was reluctant to go to school, and later he began studying psychological counseling under her guidance, learning psychological techniques. The visitor trusted him, and at that time, she had established her own studio to provide public welfare consulting services. She said she handed over the office keys and phone to him and guided him in offering public welfare consultations. Due to the visitor's open personality, the office area was essentially completely open, and the work computer had no encryption. All her 13 years of work experience and study materials were stored on the computer, and the visitor was completely unguarded. S had no consulting experience, and she taught him step by step, even arranging consultations for him and paying him 400 yuan per hour. During their collaboration, S requested her to write 1,000 case experiences in his resume.", "After the collaboration, the company had a division of labor: she was in charge of external affairs while Mr. S handled internal matters. They were hiring an office clerk, and Mr. S recruited a 50-year-old rural woman. She couldn't use a computer and didn't speak Mandarin, with a monthly salary of 2,000 yuan and lunch provided. After working for over a month, she asked staff member A to buy a toilet brush, but A mistakenly bought a shoe brush instead. Many tasks were beyond her capability. Initially, it was agreed that if someone couldn't meet the requirements, they would be replaced, but when it came time to rehire, Mr. S created various issues, using the excuse of lack of cooperation to prevent visitors from dismissing the incompetent employee. Moreover, Mr. S even tried to persuade the visitor by saying, \"Only this older sister can highlight your youth and beauty.\" It was only later that it was discovered they were relatives. In the end, they paid an extra month's salary to let A leave. Mr. S said that if things were not settled, A's husband and family would come to disrupt the company. The visitor later learned that Mr. S, in return for A's help, had brought her into the company just to do cleaning work and paid her 2,000 yuan.", "3. In order to cultivate S, the visitor devoted themselves wholeheartedly, without any reservations, sharing 13 years of clinical experience without holding back, from how to receive initial consultations, to how to build a good consulting relationship, and the most cost-effective and efficient learning path for the growth of consultants. They hoped for a good collaboration and referred cases with her name to S. This allowed S to accumulate experience while earning a salary, commission, and bonuses, learning various psychological techniques for free at a high salary. S coached a primary school boy's academic performance and shamelessly asked the visitor to teach him methods for training quick learning abilities.", "4. During the cooperation period, Mr. S repeatedly threatened the visitor with various reasons not to cooperate, while Mr. S controlled the company's finances. On New Year's Eve, Mr. S's 17-year-old son sent a text message to the visitor, wanting to discuss company development matters. The visitor refused, and then Mr. S continued to propose withdrawing from the cooperation on New Year's Eve. Ultimately, the visitor, unable to endure any longer, allowed Mr. S to exit the partnership and let him go.", "5. After the follow-up visit with client S, a consultation contract was provided to the parents of a fourth-grade boy, promising that the child's math grades would improve by the end of the counseling sessions. However, after the tutoring ended, the grades not only failed to improve but actually declined, resulting in the parents demanding a refund with the contract and the child's grades in hand. The company issued a full refund. To this day, no responsibility has been pursued from S. In an effort to establish a consulting relationship with a boy who dropped out of the first year of middle school, S bought a pack of cigarettes and smoked with the boy, leading to the boy's father losing faith in psychological counseling. A full refund was issued later.", "The visitor was once emotionally low, unable to engage in normal work for a long time, suffering from a serious sense of self-worth damage, and feeling pessimistic and distrustful of others. After experiencing anger, resentment, grievance, regret, and self-blame, the visitor was concerned about being laughed at by others. Through the SCL-90 psychological test and interview, it was assessed that the visitor had mild depressive symptoms. First, the visitor's kindness and sincerity were acknowledged, and their feelings of anger, helplessness, and worries about the company's future were understood, stabilizing the visitor's emotions. \n\nIn the first step, an emotional paper arrangement was conducted with Mr. S, allowing the visitor to release their anger and strong desire for revenge through verbal expression. In the arrangement with Ms. A, the visitor released their self-blame for weak management abilities and guilt over not being able to handle situations decisively. \n\nSecond, through the organization of paper arrangements, the relationships between the legal representative, various shareholders, common interest goals, clients, etc., were presented. In the arrangement, the visitor observed that Mr. S's paper did not point towards the common interest goals or the legal representative, but rather towards the outside. Meanwhile, the visitor's legal representative was positioned towards the common interest goals along with another shareholder, but did not face the clients. This presentation helped the visitor identify the underlying problems. Although the company was established, its development was temporarily disordered, and the lack of a sound management system allowed for loopholes. However, any organizational system transitions from disorder to order to good development, and only when collaborators have common interest goals can the objectives of the organizational system be achieved. \n\nThird, through the visitor's House-Tree-Person test, it was evident that the visitor's family social support system was weak, and their personality was rigid, lacking flexibility, and resilience in problem-solving. During the consultation, an inner arrangement was arranged to connect with the visitor's parents and family, reconciling the visitor's relationship with their origin family, enhancing life energy, and increasing their capacity for responsibility. \n\nFourth, an organizational arrangement was conducted to represent the relationships with clients 1, 2, and 3, revealing the mutual projection and identification with the visitor during the consultation process. This alleviated the consultant's object usage and self-narcissistic state, allowing for a return to being an ordinary person and a typical psychological counselor, with self-awareness, acceptance of personal human weaknesses, and greater tolerance for the weaknesses of others. \n\nFifth, an arrangement was made with the visitor concerning their spiritual system, sequentially arranging the counselor's and visitor's personalities, interests, hobbies, and self-evaluations, revealing the visitor's deep-seated feelings of inferiority, fear, insecurity, and emotional dependency. This allowed the visitor to see their character and emotions reconciled, submissive, and accepted, no longer in opposition, and integrating their self. \n\nLastly, an inner gratitude meditation was conducted for the visitor.", "On this difficult and irreversible path of being a psychological counselor, I find it very hard, but with each step, I see the real me, getting closer to my true self, and I am also very happy.", "I am grateful that my parents gave me a mind that learns easily.", "I am grateful that my parents gave me a strong and unyielding heart.", "I am grateful that my parents planted the seeds of kindness in me.", "I am grateful that my mentors have made my life more robust.", "I am grateful that heaven has given me a stable home.", "I am grateful that heaven has given me a lovely and understanding daughter.", "I am grateful that heaven has given me a free and carefree life.", "I am grateful that encounters with petty people have made me stronger.", "I am grateful for the bittersweet life that has helped me grow.", "I am grateful to the heavens for granting me a colorful destiny.", "I am grateful for all the encounters, both the beautiful and the unpleasant.", "It's all to lead me towards a better future!", "Grateful for all existence!"], "experience_and_reflection": "Insights from Consultation: Through this supervision with a psychological counselor, I saw a kind and sincere person without defenses. Psychologists, like all individuals, are subject to the unpredictable ebb and flow of life’s challenges. They face interpersonal dilemmas, endure setbacks, and experience betrayal and deception. These trials, though harsh, are instrumental lessons that catalyze our personal and professional growth. In the process of navigating these challenges, it becomes crucial to assume responsibility, introspect on one's journey, and strive for personal transformation through reflection and learning.\n\nThis case, involving the counselor and her experiences with Mr. S, is a profound exploration of human vulnerability and resilience. Initially, the counselor's journey is marked by a commendable commitment to fostering a supportive and nurturing environment for Mr. S. This commitment, however, becomes a double-edged sword as her trust is met with betrayal. It’s a stark reminder of the delicate balance between professional generosity and the necessity for boundaries. The counselor's trust in Mr. S—once a mentee and later a collaborator—reflects her innate kindness and desire to uplift others. Yet, this same trust exposes her to manipulation and deceit, underscoring the importance of maintaining a vigilant awareness of professional boundaries even amidst altruistic intentions.\n\nThe unfolding events serve as a mirror to the counselor's internal struggles. Her initial inability to discern Mr. S’s intentions is not merely a professional oversight but a deeper reflection of her personal journey and the emotional dependencies that might have clouded her judgment. This highlights the complexity of human relationships in professional settings, where personal emotions often intertwine with professional responsibilities. The counselor's journey, therefore, becomes one of unraveling these intertwined threads, an essential process for any psychologist seeking to maintain the integrity of their practice.\n\nThe counselor's emotional turmoil, as evidenced by her periods of anger, resentment, and self-blame, points to a significant internal conflict. This conflict is characterized by a profound sense of self-worth damage, a common repercussion of betrayal. Her response—initial paralysis and later, a drive towards introspection and self-improvement—illustrates the dual nature of psychological trauma. It can debilitate but also offers a path to renewal and resilience when approached with introspection and a willingness to learn.\n\nA critical element in the counselor's healing process is the structured intervention using various therapeutic techniques. The emotional paper arrangement with Mr. S serves as a cathartic release of pent-up emotions, allowing the counselor to externalize and process her anger. This process is vital, as it shifts the counselor from a state of emotional reactivity to one of emotional regulation, setting the stage for deeper introspection and healing.\n\nThe organizational arrangements further illuminate the structural weaknesses within the counselor’s professional sphere, highlighting how the absence of a robust management system can create vulnerabilities. The visual representation of relationships and goals through paper arrangements offers the counselor a tangible means to assess and realign her professional objectives, fostering a strategic mindset essential for overcoming organizational disarray. This aspect of the intervention not only aids in resolving current conflicts but also equips the counselor with insights necessary for future endeavors.\n\nFurthermore, the House-Tree-Person test reveals the counselor's need for a stronger social support system and greater flexibility in problem-solving. This insight is crucial, as it underscores the importance of a resilient personal foundation in supporting professional integrity and effectiveness. The subsequent inner arrangement to reconnect with her family of origin signifies a pivotal step in rebuilding this foundation. By reconciling with her roots, the counselor enhances her life energy, reinforcing her capacity to face future challenges with renewed strength and confidence.\n\nThe exploration of the counselor's spiritual system and personality traits through sequential arrangements uncovers deep-seated feelings of inferiority and insecurity. Recognizing these emotions is a transformative moment for the counselor, as it enables her to integrate and accept these aspects of her identity rather than perceive them as oppositional forces. This integration fosters a holistic self-acceptance, crucial for personal peace and professional authenticity.\n\nThe final step of inner gratitude meditation encapsulates the counselor's journey towards healing and transformation. By cultivating gratitude, the counselor shifts her focus from the pain of past experiences to the possibilities of growth and resilience. This shift is not merely a therapeutic exercise but a profound realignment of her worldview, allowing her to embrace the complexity of her journey with grace and acceptance.\n\nIn reflecting on this case, I am reminded of the inherent humanity in psychological practice. Counselors, though equipped with professional expertise, are not immune to the vulnerabilities and challenges that accompany human relationships. This case underscores the importance of continual self-reflection and growth in our profession, urging us to remain vigilant, compassionate, and resilient in our pursuit of helping others. Through the lens of this counselor’s journey, we are invited to embrace our own vulnerabilities, transforming them into strengths that enhance our capacity to serve and support our clients with authenticity and empathy.\n\nUltimately, this case is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit. Despite the challenges and betrayals faced, the counselor emerges with a deeper understanding of herself and her professional landscape. Her journey illustrates the transformative power of introspection, learning, and gratitude, offering a beacon of hope and guidance for fellow practitioners navigating their own complex professional terrains.", "causes": "Betrayal by business partner, resulting in damage to the company and other aspects.", "symptoms": "Mild depression.

{"id": 156, "case_description": ["The visitor is a male, a second-year high school student who has taken a leave of absence due to a lack of motivation to study and is staying at home. The parents sought help for the visit.", "It all started with a phone call from the mother describing the child's situation. The child had good grades in middle school and, after working hard in the third year, was accepted into a local key high school (top 5). This high school is known for its military-style management, with strict teaching requirements and a heavy and intense schedule. In the first half of the first year, the child's grades began to decline continuously, dropping from around 20th in the class to about 10th from the bottom, causing anxiety for both the child and the parents. In the first half of the second year, after undergoing a minor surgery for hemorrhoids, the child was teased by classmates, who called him \"hemorrhoid boy,\" making him very uncomfortable and even leading to a physical altercation with a classmate. Subsequently, he threw a tantrum at home, expressing his pain to his parents and strongly insisting that he did not want to go to school anymore. The parents believed that since the child had just had surgery, he indeed needed some time to recover, and with the New Year approaching, they agreed to let him take a break from school. They also communicated with the teachers, planning for him to return to school around March after the New Year.", "But now it's almost April, and the child does nothing but play games at home every day. He doesn't watch the learning videos sent by the teacher and doesn't do his homework. Whenever his parents talk to him, he throws things and gets angry. His father runs a small foreign trade business and often travels for work to support the family. His mother usually helps him with the business. After the child entered high school, she mainly stayed at home to take care of him. Seeing a child who doesn't study and takes no responsibility for himself makes the parents anxious, especially when they think about their own hard work and the money they earn. The parents are seriously worried and have given the child a strict ultimatum: if he really doesn't want to study, then he can stop, go work outside to gain some life experience, and later figure out how to start a small business to support himself.", "After thinking for a few days, the child informed their parents that they wanted to seek psychological counseling to help themselves return to school sooner. The parents then reached out to me, wanting to work together to help their child return to school as soon as possible."], "consultation_process": ["During the first consultation, the child arrived nearly two hours early. After arriving, he was very excited throughout the session. He expressed his expectations about how psychological counseling could help him and spent a long time talking about the preparations he had made for the consultation. I could only ask him a few questions when there was an opportunity, guiding him to talk more about his current state, his thoughts on his studies and life, as well as his previous high school experience. When asked about his high school studies, his mood noticeably dropped, and he repeatedly emphasized the pressure that school put on him, which he found unbearable, especially regarding daily school tasks, such as morning reading and daily self-study feedback. He felt he had no energy to complete these tasks; feeling powerless and lacking energy was his daily state of study. He was also quite evasive when it came to discussing his previous high school life. When I explicitly expressed my desire to understand this part, he would respond with statements like, \"Those days made me very troubled and painful; I don’t want to talk about it.\"", "During the first consultation, based on his narration and my observations of him, he exhibited periods of excitement and restlessness, as well as moments of depression and low mood. I assessed that he currently has bipolar disorder. Throughout the consultation, he also displayed a desire to please, making a strong effort to showcase the positive aspects of his current state. However, I have some doubts about his own accounts. During the first follow-up after the consultation, I also reconfirmed certain situations with his mother.", "In the second consultation, I wanted to help the child recount his experiences at school and seek out the positive aspects of his time there. However, he used the hour as a complaining session, spending nearly 40 minutes talking about his suppressed and powerless school life. He expressed that the teachers' fast pace left him unable to keep up, and that conflicts with classmates were measured by academic performance, which hurt his sincere heart. I initially hoped to help him find meaning in his studies amidst his fluctuating emotions, but as I allowed him to speak without interruption, I found myself sympathizing with him and immersing myself in his life, feeling his pain from school. This created empathy, allowing him to express the repressed parts of himself, but it did not provide any practical help regarding the essence of his problems.", "The third consultation aimed to work on his side story. We explored his relationship with Xiao Q, who he said brings him some joy and sometimes discusses math problems with him. The counselor asked him to share his story with Xiao Q, reflecting on the impact Xiao Q has had on him and his thoughts about their future connection. The client mentioned that he is currently making a birthday gift for Xiao Q, a short video of about ten minutes. He works on it every day, including clips of them playing basketball together and their happy times studying together during the summer after their first year of high school. I praised him for his efforts in their friendship and expressed curiosity about his computer skills (because his mother said he spends all day playing games and not studying. I wanted to find out who was right and explore the positive significance of computers for him). Through this curious inquiry, I discovered that the child had once again idealized his image. He did not directly answer my question, looked down, and casually said, \"It's just okay.\" The counselor asked if we could admire the child's masterpiece after the video was completed, but the child did not respond.", "In the fourth consultation, we continued to explore his other positive energy points. I was curious about how the child managed to get into such a good school, ranking even in the top 20 of his class. The child described that his admission to this school was entirely due to money. At that time, his mother sought help from various sources and found a very \"impressive\" math teacher for one-on-one tutoring. In fact, he had already been unable to understand what the math teacher was explaining in the third year of junior high, but this math teacher was able to help him catch up. Especially during the high school entrance exam, this teacher accurately predicted the last three major questions, which allowed him to gain admission to this school. Now, that math teacher is no longer tutoring him, and he doesn't want his parents to spend a lot of money on useless classes again, resulting in his current situation: unable to understand, declining grades, a blow to his self-esteem, and a vicious cycle of further incomprehension.", "Originally, I wanted the child to share his story of successfully getting into this key high school to help him discover his abilities. However, in his description, I found the reasons behind his lack of motivation to study. This is a child who has been pushed by parents and tutors; when that support is gone, his true abilities are laid bare. During this consultation, I also asked myself what my real goal was in helping him return to school. Is it enough for my consultation to be deemed successful just because he goes back to school?", "The fifth and sixth consultations are both about searching for his own energy. Previously, regarding his math abilities, aside from the help from extracurricular teachers, was there any part that he worked hard on himself? At school, were there any subjects that made him feel he could learn well? How did he study those subjects? If he returns to school, how would he distinguish between not being able to learn anything and just being relatively weak in science subjects? What is the significance of wanting to return to school, and does this reveal his desire to understand the impact of taking a break from school on his life?", "By focusing on the subplots that are overlooked, it demonstrates the child's abilities to counter the main storyline of \"being unable to continue due to insufficient ability.\""], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on this complex case has provided me with significant insights into both the therapeutic process and the intricate dynamics between the child, his parents, and myself as the therapist. The journey with this family has not been straightforward, and the challenges encountered have offered me opportunities to grow as a clinician and to refine my understanding of narrative therapy and its application in cases involving family dynamics and educational reluctance.\n\nInitially, my primary focus was on using narrative therapy to help the child recognize and harness his own strengths. This approach was designed to empower him to reshape his story from one of failure and inability to cope with school demands to one of resilience and self-discovery. However, it became evident that while the child's emotional state showed signs of improvement, the core issue of returning to school remained unresolved. This realization prompted me to delve deeper into the underlying factors contributing to his reluctance, moving beyond the surface-level goal of school reintegration.\n\nThe child's narrative revealed a pattern of external pressure and reliance on external validation for his academic success. His history of being pushed by his parents and tutors highlighted a dependency on external support structures, which, once removed, left him feeling exposed and inadequate. This insight illuminated the need to shift the therapeutic focus from simply achieving academic reintegration to fostering a sense of internal motivation and self-efficacy.\n\nThroughout the consultations, I noticed the child oscillating between periods of excitement and depressive moods, leading me to suspect an underlying bipolar disorder. This hypothesis was supported by his mother's corroboration of his mood swings and his own accounts of feeling both energized and drained by different aspects of his life. Recognizing this potential diagnosis was crucial in understanding the child's experiences and in shaping my therapeutic approach to accommodate his fluctuating emotional states.\n\nAs the sessions progressed, it became increasingly clear that my role had inadvertently become one of mediation between the child's desires and his parents' expectations. The parents, driven by their own anxieties and societal pressures, were adamant about their child returning to school, viewing academic success as a measure of their own parenting and financial investment. This dynamic placed me in a challenging position, where I was perceived as a tool for both parties: a means for the parents to enforce their expectations and a refuge for the child to delay confronting his school-related anxieties.\n\nThis realization forced me to confront my own biases and intentions as a therapist. I grappled with the ethical implications of aligning with the parents' demands versus honoring the child's current emotional needs. The tension between these competing priorities led me to question the effectiveness of my interventions and whether I was truly facilitating meaningful change.\n\nEngaging in supervision was instrumental in helping me navigate these complexities. Through reflective discussions, I gained clarity on the importance of respecting the child's readiness and autonomy in the therapeutic process. The supervision reinforced that forcing the child back to school without addressing the root causes of his reluctance would likely exacerbate his distress and undermine the therapeutic alliance.\n\nMoving forward, my focus shifted towards nurturing the child's intrinsic strengths and interests, independent of academic performance. This involved exploring his relationship with Xiao Q, which emerged as a source of joy and motivation for him. By encouraging the child to reflect on this friendship, we uncovered moments of genuine connection and shared experiences that contrasted sharply with his negative school narrative. These discussions served as a gateway to explore his latent abilities and interests, such as his burgeoning computer skills, which had been overshadowed by his gaming habits.\n\nThis exploration highlighted the importance of validating the child's existing competencies and interests, thereby fostering a sense of agency and self-worth. It also provided an opportunity to challenge the dominant narrative of academic inadequacy, which had been perpetuated by his school experiences and parental expectations.\n\nThe journey with this family has underscored the delicate balance between supporting the child in navigating his educational challenges and respecting his developmental trajectory. It has reinforced the necessity of adopting a holistic approach that considers the individual's emotional, cognitive, and social contexts. By focusing on the child's personal growth and resilience, rather than solely on academic outcomes, we can facilitate a more sustainable and meaningful path forward.\n\nIn conclusion, this case has been a profound learning experience, teaching me the value of patience, empathy, and flexibility in therapeutic practice. It has highlighted the importance of maintaining an open dialogue with both the child and his parents, ensuring that all voices are heard and respected. As I continue to work with this family, my commitment remains to empower the child to craft his own narrative, one that honors his unique strengths and aspirations, while gently guiding him towards a future that is both fulfilling and authentic.", "causes": "High parental expectations, pressure from strict school management, social frustration due to ridicule from classmates, and lack of motivation for independent learning and independent coping ability.", "symptoms": "Possible tendency to bipolar disorder", "treatment_process": "Narrative therapy is used to guide the child's expression in the early stage, explore personal stories and positive energy points in the later stage, reassess the treatment goals, and explore the child's own strengths and interests.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Low motivation for learning, mood swinging between excitement and depression, strong resistance to school life, strained relationship with parents.", "treatment_effect": "After six counseling sessions, the child's emotional state improved, but the core issue of returning to school was not fully resolved, and there was still resistance, and the treatment made stage-by-stage progress."}

Chief Complaint and Personal Statement \n\nChief Complaint: Depressed mood, feelings of loneliness and irritability, accompanied by difficulty falling asleep and poor appetite for half a month. \n\nPersonal Statement: For the past half month, I have become despondent and my mood has been low. I have not been getting along well with my roommates, and our relationship has been tense. I am reluctant to return to the dormitory, leaving early in the morning and coming back very late at night. I find it hard to fall asleep at night, and I often get distracted and zone out during classes. When I first started school, I felt like everyone was getting along well, and we would often go in and out together, but soon I realized that I didn’t quite fit in. They all enjoyed discussing celebrity gossip, and then there were the boys, but I’m not very interested in those topics. I feel that their behavior is rather degenerate, and in such a dormitory, I feel very disheartened. Later, I began to act alone, going to the library to read, and gradually became distant from my roommates. They never asked me to join their activities, and conflicts started to arise over trivial matters, such as different schedules, living habits, and chores. For instance, they always like to stay up late, either watching movies or chatting on the phone at night, while I prefer to go to bed early. When I sleep, they are still chatting in the dormitory without regard for me. I mentioned this a few times; it worked at first, but later they simply ignored my requests or whispered to each other. I feel they do not respect me at all and seem to be deliberately opposing me, which is really suffocating. One of my roommates, Lin, has an extroverted personality and loves to steal the spotlight. Whenever I have a suggestion, she always opposes it, acting very self-righteous. I always treat her with great respect, but she often looks down on me. Sometimes, in comparison to her, I feel very inferior and unbalanced. Two weeks ago, in the morning when the other roommates were not around, I received a call for Lin about the specific time and location for her interview, but I forgot to tell her. As a result, she missed the opportunity, and she believed I was jealous and deliberately withheld the information from her. I got very angry and we had an argument, parting ways unhappily. However, I felt hurt and gradually became unwilling to interact with her. Whenever Lin is around, I feel very oppressed and am afraid to speak more. I experience a sense of tension; seeing Lin chatting freely with other students makes me feel lonely and oppressed. I think she is too arrogant and isolates me along with the other roommates, not caring about my feelings. At this point, I feel Lin should restrain herself in front of me, speak less, and be more cautious like I am. At night, I have trouble sleeping; after the lights go out, hearing others typing on keyboards or moving around prevents me from falling asleep. Seeing others able to sleep makes me feel very anxious, and I find it hard to endure. I hope to change my situation through psychological counseling. \n\nII. Personal Growth History \n\nThe visitor was born full-term through natural delivery and has developed normally since childhood, without any serious illnesses. The family of three has a stable life, with no major accidents occurring in the family. Being an only child, the parents have high expectations and strict discipline, but there is little communication. As both parents are in business, they are usually busy and spend little time at home, leading the visitor to have more memories of loneliness during childhood. From elementary school to high school, the visitor has consistently performed well academically. However, due to an excessive focus on studies, the visitor is not good at making friends, resulting in a small social circle. The visitor has rarely lived in a collective dormitory. In the first semester of senior year, due to academic pressure, the visitor applied to live on campus but moved back home within a week due to difficulties adapting. During the college entrance examination, excessive anxiety led to underperformance, and the visitor did not get into the first-choice university, eventually enrolling in the current teacher training institution. \n\nIII. Observations and Collected Information \n\n(A) Initial Impression \nThe visitor appears depressed, with furrowed brows, dressed neatly but in dark tones. They speak softly and clearly but display a shy and introverted demeanor, avoiding eye contact with the counselor. \n\n(B) Mental State \n1. Perception: No abnormalities observed; memory and thought processes are normal. \n2. Emotional and Affective Expression: Facial expressions show slight tension, but communication is clear. \n3. Personality Integrity: The personality is somewhat introverted, with no significant changes. \n4. Self-awareness: Complete self-awareness and actively seeking help. \n\n(C) Physical State \nPoor sleep quality, normal menstrual cycle, no major physiological illnesses. \n\n(D) Social Work and Social Interaction \nAble to attend classes but easily distracted and reluctant to engage with others. Can participate in school activities but is not very active. Relationships with classmates are average. \n\n(E) Psychological Measurement \nThe visitor expresses no desire to undergo psychological measurement. \n\nIV. Assessment and Diagnosis \n\n(A) Assessment \nThrough observation and the visitor's behavior and words, it is assessed that the visitor has normal intelligence, complete self-awareness, and no physical abnormalities. There are cognitive biases, and when problems arise, the visitor does not attempt to actively solve them, opting instead to avoid and isolate themselves, lacking appropriate methods to channel negative emotions, leading to tense interpersonal relationships. Overall, the visitor's situation falls under the category of general psychological issues. \n\n(B) Diagnosis \nThe preliminary diagnosis is categorized under the realm of psychological unhealthiness: tense interpersonal relationships. Diagnostic criteria: \n1. Course Standard: The visitor's psychological issues were triggered by real-life factors and have lasted less than a month. \n2. Symptomatology Standard: Negative emotions such as tension, low mood, loneliness, and irritability, as well as physiological symptoms like difficulty falling asleep and decreased appetite. \n3. Severity Standard: Negative emotions remain under rational control and have not generalized; the visitor can live normally, but learning efficiency has declined. \n\nV. Differential Diagnosis \n\n(A) Differentiating from Psychosis: According to the three principles of psychosis diagnosis, the visitor's knowledge, intention, and coordination are consistent, personality traits show no significant changes, there is self-awareness, a strong desire for help, and no symptoms of hallucinations or delusions, thus psychosis can be excluded. \n\n(B) Differentiating from Anxiety Neurosis: Symptoms of anxiety neurosis mainly involve persistent, unresolved anxiety that severely impacts social functioning, with generalization and avoidance, and the duration exceeds three months or six months. Although the visitor primarily exhibits anxiety symptoms, they do not severely affect social functioning or logical thinking, and there is no generalization or avoidance, with a duration of less than one month, so anxiety neurosis can be excluded. \n\n(C) Differentiating from Severe Psychological Problems: Severe psychological problems exhibit strong reactions that have generalized and severely impact social functioning, lasting more than two months. The visitor's psychological issues are not severe, do not significantly affect social functioning, and the duration is relatively short, so severe psychological problems can be excluded. \n\nVI. Cause Analysis \n\n(A) Biological Causes: No significant biological causes have been observed in the visitor's psychological issues. \n\n(B) Social Causes: \n1. Conflicts with roommates, lacking an effective social support system. \n2. Strict family upbringing, with a lack of communication and interaction among family members. \n\n(C) Psychological Cause Analysis: \n1. Cognitive biases exist: \"How I treat others, others should treat me the same.\" \n2. Emotional reasons: Difficulty resolving negative emotions such as loneliness, tension, and oppression. \n3. Lack of proactive problem-solving behavior patterns. \n\nVII. Counseling Plan Development \n\n(A) Counseling Goals \nShort-term Goals: To allow the visitor's repressed emotions to be fully expressed and alleviate negative emotions. To change the visitor's irrational views and improve the tense state of interpersonal relationships. Long-term Goals: To help the visitor re-establish new response patterns in cognitive methods, thought processes, and emotional and behavioral expressions, using a rational outlook on life to create a fulfilling life and promote healthy development. \n\n(B) Counseling Plan \n1. Methods: Primarily using Ellis's Rational Emotive Therapy and relaxation training from behavioral therapy. \n2. Principles: Rational Emotive Therapy, created by the American psychologist Ellis in the 1950s, is a psychological treatment theory and method. The ABC theory is the core of Rational Emotive Therapy, where A represents the activating event; B represents the individual's perception of that event, their beliefs, and evaluations; C represents the emotional and behavioral consequences following that event. This theory emphasizes that emotions stem from an individual's thoughts and beliefs rather than the external triggering events themselves, and individuals can change their emotions by altering these thoughts. Relaxation training in behavioral therapy consciously controls psychological and physiological activities to lower arousal levels and improve bodily dysfunction. This aims to relieve the visitor's tension. \n3. Rights and Responsibilities: A printed document outlining the rights and responsibilities of both parties will be provided to the visitor, informing them they can raise any questions at any time. The responsibilities, rights, and obligations of both parties are as follows: \n(1) The visitor has the responsibility to provide the counselor with truthful information related to their psychological issues; to actively explore solutions with the counselor; to complete agreed-upon assignments. They have the right to understand, choose, or change counselors and the obligation to adhere to the agreed-upon counseling plan and appointment times. \n(2) The counselor has the responsibility to help the visitor resolve psychological issues; to strictly adhere to confidentiality principles. They have the right to understand personal information related to the visitor's psychological issues; with a responsible attitude towards the visitor, they have the right to refer or terminate counseling. They are obligated to adhere to the agreed-upon counseling plan and appointment times and to inform the visitor in advance of any special circumstances. \n4. Counseling Time: Counseling will take place every Monday afternoon; if there are special circumstances, both parties can agree on a different time. \n\nVIII. Counseling Process \n\n1. Diagnosis Stage: Establishing the counseling relationship, collecting relevant information, conducting psychological diagnosis, and formulating the counseling plan. \n2. Counseling Stage: Helping the visitor analyze and solve problems, changing their maladaptive cognition, emotions, and behaviors. \n3. Consolidation Stage: Summarizing and enhancing the counseling. \n\nSpecific Counseling Process \n\nDiagnosis Stage: First Counseling (March 2016) \nTask: Understand basic situations, analyze and clarify issues, and negotiate counseling goals. Help the visitor express their negative emotions and alleviate emotional distress, establishing a good counseling relationship. \n\nMethods: Listening, open-ended questioning, emotional response techniques, and relaxation training. \n\nProcess: Inquire about basic situations, introduce the nature of psychological counseling, confidentiality principles, etc., and through building trust, gain a comprehensive and truthful understanding of the visitor's basic situation. Inform the visitor that their problems can be improved but require their active cooperation; the effectiveness of counseling is inseparable from the visitor's own efforts. Use listening, open-ended questions, and emotional response techniques to show understanding and concern for the visitor's feelings of distress, loneliness, and helplessness. Then analyze the issues with the visitor, develop a counseling plan, clarify both parties' obligations and rights, and set counseling times. The visitor's main issues are threefold: \n1. Lin's poor attitude towards me indicates a lack of respect. \n2. Tension in the relationship with roommates, feeling isolated and deliberately opposed by them, leading to reluctance to return to the dormitory. \n3. Poor sleep quality, difficulty falling asleep at night, and a poor state of mind during the day, making it hard to concentrate in class. \n\nGuide the visitor in learning relaxation training techniques to ease their negative emotions, allowing them to practice relaxation: Using a light, gentle, pleasant tone to guide progressive muscle relaxation and encouraging the visitor to imagine themselves in a relaxing situation, practicing relaxation of forearms, facial muscles, neck, shoulders, back, chest, abdomen, and lower limbs, with a focus on facial muscle relaxation, repeating several times. \n\nAssign homework: Practice relaxation training once a day for 20 minutes, repeatedly practicing until they can do it comfortably in real life, and carefully observe the emotional changes before and after training, recording their experiences. \n\nCounseling Summary: Through the first counseling session, a good counseling relationship was established with the visitor. The visitor felt the counselor's respect, warmth, and active concern, demonstrating full trust in the counselor. The visitor's negative emotions were fully expressed, and emotional distress was alleviated. \n\nSecond Counseling (April 2016) \nThird Counseling (April 2016) \nTask: Help the visitor correct or abandon their original irrational beliefs and replace them with rational beliefs to alleviate or eliminate their symptoms. \n\nFourth Counseling (April 2016) \nTask: Guide the visitor to establish positive emotional responses, replacing previous irrational beliefs with new rational beliefs. \n\nMethods: Primarily using rational emotive imagery techniques. \n\nIX. Counseling Effectiveness Evaluation \n\n(A) Visitor Self-Assessment \nIn an email sent a week later, the visitor expressed gratitude for the counselor's help again and mentioned that their relationship with roommates is now harmonious. A few days ago, Lin's birthday occurred, and the visitor bought a cake for her, which Lin appreciated, while the visitor genuinely practiced the golden rule of communication. \n\n(B) Counselor Assessment \nTwo weeks after the counseling ended, during a psychological counseling event in the square, the counselor spotted the visitor, who had just joined the school's psychological association. Upon observation, the visitor appeared to be in good spirits, healthy, and engaged naturally and graciously with other students, showing good interpersonal relationships."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on the case of Zhao, a first-year university student struggling with interpersonal relationships, has provided me with a wealth of insights and learning experiences. This case underscored the complexity of psychological counseling, particularly when dealing with young adults who are at a transitional stage in their lives. Zhao's experience is a microcosm of the larger challenges faced by many students in adapting to new social environments, and it brought to light several important considerations in therapeutic practice.\n\nOne of the primary insights from this case was the effectiveness of Rational Emotive Therapy (RET) in addressing the cognitive distortions that often underpin interpersonal conflicts. Zhao's cognitive bias, encapsulated in her belief that \"how I treat others, others should treat me the same,\" was a central point of tension in her relationships. This belief is not uncommon among individuals who have been raised in environments with high expectations and little emotional reciprocity, as was the case with Zhao's upbringing. Her parents' lack of communication and emotional expression seemed to have fostered a rigid expectation of reciprocal treatment from others, which, when unmet, led to feelings of disrespect and isolation.\n\nThe gradual transformation of Zhao's beliefs through RET was pivotal. By dissecting the ABC model—Activating events, Beliefs, and Consequences—Zhao began to recognize how her interpretations of her roommates' behaviors were leading to unnecessary emotional distress. For instance, her perception of Lin's extroverted behavior as arrogance and deliberate exclusion was more a reflection of her own insecurities and cognitive biases rather than Lin's actual intentions. Helping Zhao to reframe these beliefs was crucial in alleviating her symptoms of loneliness and irritability.\n\nAdditionally, the incorporation of relaxation training from behavioral therapy complemented the cognitive work of RET. Zhao's difficulty in managing her emotional responses was evident in her poor sleep quality and heightened tension around her roommates. Relaxation techniques, particularly progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery, provided her with practical tools to manage physiological arousal and create a sense of calm. This not only improved her sleep but also empowered her to approach her social interactions with a clearer and more composed mindset.\n\nThe counseling process itself highlighted the importance of patience and gradual progression. Initially, Zhao was resistant to the idea of change, reflecting a common phenomenon where clients cling to familiar, albeit maladaptive, cognitive patterns due to the fear of the unknown. The step-by-step approach in RET, coupled with the consistent reinforcement of relaxation techniques, allowed Zhao to slowly dismantle her irrational beliefs and replace them with more balanced and rational ones. This underscores the necessity of allowing clients the time and space to internalize new ways of thinking, rather than rushing towards outcomes.\n\nAnother key learning point was the critical role of the therapeutic relationship. Building a foundation of trust and empathy was essential for Zhao to feel safe enough to explore her vulnerabilities. Our initial sessions focused heavily on active listening and empathetic engagement, which served to validate her experiences and emotions. Through this, Zhao felt respected and understood, which was particularly important given her history of feeling neglected and misunderstood by her family and peers. The therapeutic alliance not only facilitated Zhao's willingness to engage with the counseling process but also provided a model of respectful and reciprocal interaction that she could aspire to replicate in her own relationships.\n\nMoreover, Zhao's subjective desire for change was a significant determinant of the counseling's success. Her active participation and willingness to practice relaxation techniques and challenge her beliefs were instrumental in achieving her counseling goals. This case reinforced the notion that while therapeutic techniques and the counselor's expertise are vital, the client's motivation and engagement are equally crucial in the therapeutic process. The responsibility lies partly with the counselor to foster and nurture this motivation through encouragement and by highlighting the client's progress.\n\nIn terms of clinical practice, this case has reinforced the importance of a comprehensive assessment phase. Understanding the interplay between Zhao's personal history, family dynamics, and current social environment was key to tailoring an effective intervention strategy. Her upbringing in a high-expectation, low-communication household was a significant factor in her interpersonal challenges, as it shaped her cognitive biases and emotional responses. This insight emphasizes the need for clinicians to consider the broader context of a client's life, including family dynamics and past experiences, in order to address present issues effectively.\n\nThe experience with Zhao also highlighted some areas for improvement in my practice. For instance, while the intervention was ultimately successful, there were moments when I questioned whether I had fully explored alternative therapeutic approaches that might have been equally or more effective. This reflection has encouraged me to remain open to integrating different therapeutic modalities and to be more flexible in my approach, adapting as needed based on the client's responses and progress.\n\nFurthermore, the case illustrated the importance of post-counseling follow-up. Zhao's self-assessment and subsequent email, as well as the observation during the psychological counseling event, provided valuable feedback on the long-term effectiveness of the intervention. Such follow-ups are crucial not only for assessing the sustainability of change but also for reinforcing the client's achievements and encouraging continued personal growth.\n\nIn conclusion, the counseling experience with Zhao was an enlightening journey that reinforced the efficacy of Rational Emotive Therapy and relaxation training in addressing interpersonal relationship issues among university students. It highlighted the importance of patience, the therapeutic relationship, and the client's active involvement in the process. This case has enriched my understanding of the complex dynamics at play in young adults' lives and has equipped me with deeper insights into how to effectively support clients through their challenges. It serves as a reminder of the profound impact that thoughtful and empathetic counseling can have on an individual's personal development and overall well-being.", "causes": "Low communication and high expectations in the family of origin.

Suppression is a crude method; seeing the self behind the emotions is the path to transforming them. This case allowed me to deeply explore the transformative potential of emotional imagery and inner child work, reaffirming how critical it is to address and integrate parts of the self that have been wounded or neglected.\n\nDuring the session, Jingchun, the seeker, presented with feelings of frustration and emotional malaise. This initial expression of discomfort set the stage for a journey of introspection and healing, which, through the techniques of imagery dialogue and hypnosis, sought to illuminate the underlying causes of his distress. As a clinician, the session highlighted the profound impact that early emotional experiences can have on an individual's current state of being and how these can manifest as unexplored territories within the psyche, often symbolized through vivid imagery during therapeutic exploration.\n\nWhen Jingchun was encouraged to visualize, he initially saw a dense, dark forest, a common metaphor for the unconscious mind—unknown, uncharted, and perhaps even feared. This imagery is significant because it reflects the initial stage of introspection where the mind presents barriers or fears that need to be confronted. The forest, with its tangled pathways and obscured clarity, represented Jingchun's own emotional confusion and the unresolved issues from his past that have been lingering, influencing his current emotional state.\n\nThe imagery of the younger self, relaxed and innocent, marked the first crucial step in this reflective journey. This image was a poignant representation of the inner child—an aspect of Jingchun that had been untouched by the complexities and traumas of adult life. However, the subsequent image of being struck while in this state of openness and innocence speaks volumes about the impact of trauma. It suggests a sudden and perhaps violent disruption to his sense of safety and trust, a moment frozen in time that continues to reverberate throughout his emotional life. This moment of visualization was a key turning point, revealing the deep-seated wounds that Jingchun had carried into adulthood.\n\nAs we transitioned into the healing phase of the session, the introduction of a rainbow light shining down into the forest symbolized hope, healing, and the integration of the fragmented parts of self. This light, often seen as a universal symbol of promise and renewal, began to illuminate the forest, suggesting that even the darkest aspects of the unconscious mind can be transformed with insight and love. The wise old man, imagined as embracing Jingchun, served as a metaphor for the nurturing, protective qualities he longed for but perhaps never received during crucial developmental periods in his life.\n\nThe emotional release that followed, marked by tears, was an essential part of the healing process. This catharsis indicated a breaking down of barriers, allowing suppressed emotions to surface and be acknowledged. Crying in therapy can be seen as a physical manifestation of emotional release, a letting go of the pent-up sadness and grief that Jingchun had carried silently for so long. Encouraging him to breathe deeply and embrace these feelings was crucial. It facilitated a reconnection with his body, grounding him and providing a sense of control over his emotional landscape.\n\nThe conversation with his inner child was another pivotal aspect of the session. By addressing the child directly, Jingchun began the process of reparenting himself, offering the love, validation, and comfort that he so desperately needed. This dialogue served to bridge the gap between his present self and the wounded child within, fostering an environment where healing and growth could occur. It was important for him to acknowledge the child's feelings of disappointment, frustration, fear, and anger, recognizing these emotions as valid and worthy of compassion rather than suppression.\n\nThroughout this therapeutic process, there was an emphasis on the flow of love. Love, in this context, was not just an abstract concept but a tangible force that could be directed inward, towards the self. The gradual emergence of love within Jingchun's imagery and emotions signified the beginning of a reconciliatory process. It was a movement away from self-criticism and towards self-compassion, a vital shift that would allow for sustained emotional healing.\n\nAs the session progressed, the child within Jingchun began to relax, a clear indication of the therapeutic work taking effect. The child’s expression, filled with light and purity, reflected the return of innocence and the reclamation of personal power that had been lost. This transformation was a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and its capacity to heal when provided with the right conditions and support.\n\nIn guiding Jingchun to embrace and merge with his inner child, the session aimed to achieve a profound sense of integration. The act of merging was symbolic of the unification of disparate parts of the self, leading to a more cohesive and empowered identity. It underscored the belief that healing is not about eradicating the past but about incorporating it into the present in a way that strengthens and enriches the individual.\n\nReflecting on this experience as a clinician, I am reminded of the essential role of empathy and patience in therapy. The ability to hold space for a client, to gently guide them through their emotional labyrinth, is both a privilege and a responsibility. This session reaffirmed my commitment to providing a safe and nurturing environment where clients can explore their vulnerabilities and emerge with a greater sense of self-awareness and self-acceptance.\n\nThe insights gained from this session also emphasize the importance of addressing childhood traumas in therapeutic settings. Many adult issues can be traced back to unresolved childhood experiences, and it is through processes like inner child work that clients can find closure and healing. This case serves as a powerful reminder that the journey to self-discovery and healing is ongoing, requiring courage, openness, and a willingness to face the shadows within.\n\nIn conclusion, this session was a profound exploration of the interplay between past and present emotions, offering valuable insights into the therapeutic process and the human capacity for healing.

I feel quite good towards mom, often going back to see her and taking care of her in detail, but we are not close. 15:00:06 *I feel it's more of an obligation. 15:01:14 Jing Chun'en, there are many reasons for the lack of connection in female power. 15:01:42 Jing Chun, this needs to be presented on site. 15:01:52 *In college, I earned my tuition, found a job, and found a partner myself. 15:02:04 Jing Chun, what we often think is often opposite to the truth. 15:02:12 *It's hard to survive without masculine traits. 15:02:41 Jing Chun, yes. 15:03:00 *But I still seem quite feminine, with an inner strength. 15:03:45 *I have always felt a distance from my children; could this be related? 15:04:11 Jing Chun, distance? 15:04:49 *I can do many farming tasks that only men usually do.

Then replace him with yourself and read it to yourself. 15:28:44 *He really wants to find a gentle and capable woman to face the complex and ever-changing life with him; he feels guilty. I am very capable and treat him well; how could I have such thoughts? I care for him meticulously in life, but when challenges arise, I can't help him at all; I can only let him face it himself. I don't want it this way, but I can't avoid it. 15:29:14 *Very ashamed. 15:30:32 *I will go crazy. 15:31:29 Jing Chun, what have you become aware of? 15:32:22 Jing Chun, replace him with yourself. 15:32:23 *If I knew he had such thoughts and wanted to ruin me every day, I would be like a boiling ant, monitoring him, looking at his phone, even wanting to kill him! So ashamed. 15:32:55 Jing Chun, for example: I hate him; change it to: I hate myself. 15:33:03 Jing Chun, read it to yourself. 15:35:59 *If I knew I had such thoughts and wanted to ruin myself every day, I would be like a boiling ant, monitoring myself, looking at my phone, even wanting to kill myself! I would go crazy. I hate that I have such ridiculous thoughts. 15:37:38 *Ashamed, relaxed, relieved, grateful. 15:40:00 *Thank you, teacher! I have released so many accumulated emotions, and I will never be like this again, feeling light in body and mind. 15:41:37 *It's been an hour; I am touched by your sincerity and superb skills. Please tell me your account number so I can see how to make a payment.

The seeker presented with anxiety, deeply rooted in a history of gender identity conflict and familial obligations. The therapeutic journey through family constellation and cognitive shifts provided a unique lens to explore these intricate dynamics.\n\nFrom the onset, the seeker's narrative revealed a longstanding struggle with gender expectations and familial roles. Her mother’s desire for a son, juxtaposed with the seeker’s birth as a daughter, set the stage for a childhood of unmet expectations and emotional distance. This early conditioning instilled a belief that masculine traits were necessary for survival, a belief that the seeker carried into adulthood. The constellation method illuminated these generational patterns, offering a space to explore how these early experiences shaped her self-perception and relational dynamics.\n\nThe therapeutic dialogue revealed the seeker's internal conflict between embodying masculine traits and maintaining her feminine identity. She expressed a dichotomy where her perceived strength and capability were both a source of empowerment and a barrier to emotional intimacy, particularly with her children and husband. This tension underscores the complexity of gender identity and its implications for emotional connectivity within family systems.\n\nA pivotal moment in therapy emerged when the seeker acknowledged her sense of obligation towards her family, particularly her mother, without the warmth of close connection. This recognition was critical, as it highlighted the transactional nature of her familial relationships, further complicating her emotional landscape. The seeker’s obligation-driven actions, although fulfilling societal and familial expectations, did not foster genuine emotional bonds, leading to a pervasive sense of disconnection.\n\nDuring the consultation, the seeker expressed a feeling of distance from her children, suspecting it might be related to her gender identity struggles and emotional history. This insight was significant, as it suggested that her internal conflicts could be influencing her maternal role and the emotional availability she provided her children. It prompted an exploration of how her perceived masculine traits, which she felt necessary for survival, might be at odds with expressions of maternal love and vulnerability.\n\nThe role of the husband in this dynamic was another focal point. Despite his academic and professional accomplishments, the seeker struggled to respect him, a sentiment she admitted affected her relationship with her children. Her son’s observations about her treatment of his father highlighted the impact of marital dynamics on family cohesion. The therapeutic intervention aimed to address these perceptions, fostering a recognition that mutual respect and strength are critical for a harmonious marital relationship.\n\nThe seeker’s admission of fear regarding her husband's potential departure was a turning point, revealing the underlying insecurity masked by her outward confidence and control. This fear manifested in extreme behaviors, such as tracking her husband during his PhD pursuits, which stemmed from unfounded suspicions. These actions, while protective in intent, indicated a deeper mistrust and vulnerability that needed addressing within the therapeutic space.\n\nA transformative aspect of the therapy was guiding the seeker to shift perspectives, particularly in recognizing her resentment and fear as reflections of her inner state. By encouraging her to replace her grievances against her husband with introspective statements, she began to confront her self-directed anger and shame. This exercise facilitated a profound internal dialogue, allowing her to identify and process emotions previously projected onto others.\n\nThe therapeutic focus on relaxation and slowing down the cognitive pace was crucial in enabling the seeker to access deeper emotional truths. By creating a space for calm reflection, the seeker was able to confront her feelings of helplessness and exhaustion. This process was vital for breaking the cycle of anxiety and fostering a sense of agency in her life.\n\nThe seeker's desire for a strong partner to navigate life's challenges pointed to a need for mutual support and shared responsibility in her marriage. This realization, coupled with her acknowledgment of guilt for harboring such thoughts, opened avenues for healing and restructuring her relational patterns. The therapy aimed to cultivate a balance between individual strength and collective harmony, emphasizing the importance of vulnerability and shared resilience.\n\nIn the culmination of therapy, the seeker's self-awareness evolved significantly. She recognized the damaging nature of her internalized beliefs and the impact of her defensive behaviors on her relationships. This newfound awareness marked the beginning of a transformative journey towards self-acceptance and emotional authenticity.\n\nReflecting on the entire process, it becomes evident that the therapeutic interventions facilitated a deep exploration of identity, relational dynamics, and emotional resilience. The seeker's journey underscores the power of family constellation work in uncovering and addressing generational patterns, while cognitive shifts provide the tools for personal growth and relational healing. The case highlights the importance of creating a therapeutic environment where individuals feel safe to explore their vulnerabilities, leading to meaningful change and enhanced emotional well-being.\n\nThe therapeutic journey in this case not only addressed the seeker's immediate anxiety but also paved the way for long-term transformation. By embracing her multifaceted identity and recognizing the interplay between her past and present, the seeker emerged with a renewed sense of self and a deeper understanding of her relational dynamics. The therapeutic process exemplified the profound impact of integrating family constellation work with cognitive shifts, offering a holistic approach to emotional healing and growth.", "causes": "Gender identity conflict, mother's excessive expectation of masculinity and childhood emotional detachment", "symptoms": "Anxiety, emotional instability, suicidal thoughts, feeling of detachment from family relationships.", "treatment_process": "Using family system arrangement and cognitive transformation techniques, the client was guided to re-conceptualize gender roles, and through role swapping and self-reflection, she realized the nature of the inner conflict.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Long-term anxiety, confused gender identity, transactional family relationships, lack of respect for her husband and fear of abandonment.", "treatment_effect": "Anxiety was significantly relieved, self-awareness was enhanced, family relationships began to improve, and she recognized her own problems and initiated a transformative process of self-acceptance."}

Reflect on why the current situation has arisen, where things went wrong, whether others have misunderstood due to your actions, or if their expectations are too high for you to meet, leading to misunderstandings.

This is what you need to reflect on. Even close siblings have their own families; focus on living your own life well. It is not your obligation or responsibility to carry their burdens. When someone does you a favor, repay it even if it's a small kindness. Although your partner's brother runs a company, how capable are they? They should be able to solve their own problems without relying on you. You may feel this relationship is unequal, leading to psychological imbalance and many complaints. Therefore, you need to negotiate with your partner and avoid harming your marital relationship over financial disputes. In fact, your arguments as a couple are often about money. You may not have communicated specifically with your partner about how much they earn, but you are frustrated that the money your father gave you has been taken by them, and they do not appreciate it, which makes you even more helpless, directing all your emotions at your partner. Your partner may not understand you; in their perception, their brother helped him before by supporting his education, and now their lives are better than yours. They should focus on improving their own lives first before having the capacity to help others. Some assistance can be offered, but some cannot; you need to understand what business the other party is involved in and whether it is legitimate.

The partner has always been supported by their older brother during school, as the parents did not fulfill their responsibilities. The visitor's partner feels that since the older brother has difficulties, they should offer help, which the visitor agrees with. Therefore, they use the money given by their parents to support the partner's older brother. However, the visitor feels psychologically unbalanced, questioning why the older brother does not help them when they are in trouble, which causes distress and affects their mood.

Additionally, they should let go of burdens that are not their responsibility and not take on excessive responsibilities, which creates a lot of pressure."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on this case of a client diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), it becomes evident that the complexities of familial relationships, genetic predispositions, and personal history intricately weave together to shape the emotional landscape of an individual. This client’s journey offers profound insights into the multifaceted nature of BPD and the therapeutic approaches that can facilitate healing and growth.\n\nInitially, the client's familial environment emerges as a significant factor influencing her emotional and psychological development. Growing up in a household characterized by frequent arguments and instability due to her parents' tumultuous relationship, she was deprived of the emotional security and stability typically provided by a nurturing family environment. The early exposure to conflict and the ensuing divorce left deep-seated scars, fostering a pervasive sense of insecurity and fear of abandonment. It is crucial to recognize how these formative experiences contribute to the client’s current relational difficulties and emotional volatility.\n\nThe genetic component also plays a pivotal role. With both parents displaying temperamental and anxious traits, it is likely that the client inherited a predisposition toward emotional dysregulation. This genetic backdrop, coupled with an underdeveloped basal ganglia, may exacerbate her susceptibility to impulsive behaviors and mood swings. Understanding the intersection of genetic and environmental influences underscores the importance of a holistic approach in treatment, recognizing that therapy should address both inherited traits and learned behaviors.\n\nIn therapeutic practice, the application of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) has proven particularly effective for clients with BPD. DBT’s emphasis on mindfulness, emotional regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness aligns well with the client's needs. The mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques employed in the sessions serve as a foundational tool for the client to cultivate a heightened awareness of her emotional states without immediate judgment or reaction. This practice not only aids in reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms but also enhances her ability to remain present and grounded during moments of emotional upheaval.\n\nFurthermore, the therapeutic process involves a significant focus on repairing and redefining interpersonal relationships. The client’s perception of having invested emotionally without reciprocation, particularly within her marital and extended family dynamics, fuels feelings of resentment and imbalance. Therapy encourages her to explore these relational patterns critically, examining whether they stem from unmet expectations or miscommunications. By fostering open and honest communication with her partner and addressing financial disagreements that often trigger conflict, the client can begin to rebuild trust and understanding.\n\nAddressing the client’s emotional instability and fear of abandonment requires a careful and empathetic exploration of her past experiences of loss and rejection. The self-harming behavior exhibited during her college years highlights a maladaptive coping mechanism for dealing with overwhelming emotional pain and perceived rejection. In therapy, it becomes essential to validate these feelings while guiding the client towards healthier strategies for managing emotional distress. By enhancing her emotional resilience and tolerance for discomfort, the client can learn to navigate life's challenges without resorting to self-destructive behaviors.\n\nAn integral part of this therapeutic journey is the emphasis on personal agency and independence. The client’s reliance on external validation and support from her partner and family members has historically contributed to her insecurities. Encouraging her to develop a stronger sense of self-efficacy and autonomy is crucial in alleviating these fears. By setting personal goals and taking actionable steps towards achieving them, the client can cultivate confidence in her abilities and diminish the fear of abandonment that often underlies her relationships.\n\nSocial support and community engagement also play a vital role in the client's recovery process. Encouraging her to seek social interactions outside her immediate family circle can provide a broader support network, reducing the emotional burden placed solely on her marital relationship. Additionally, exploring activities that bring her joy and fulfillment, such as hobbies or volunteering, can enhance her sense of purpose and contribute to overall well-being.\n\nReflecting on the broader implications of this case, it becomes apparent that establishing boundaries within familial relationships is crucial for maintaining healthy dynamics. While familial bonds often imply mutual support, it is essential to recognize the limits of this support to prevent dependency and resentment. In the client's case, financial entanglements with her in-laws have created a sense of obligation and psychological imbalance. Therapy helps her to navigate these boundaries, reinforcing the notion that while support is valuable, it should not come at the cost of personal well-being or relationship integrity.\n\nIn conclusion, this case underscores the importance of a comprehensive and empathetic approach to treating individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder. By addressing the interplay of genetic, environmental, and personal factors, therapy can facilitate meaningful change and empower clients to lead more balanced and fulfilling lives. As clinicians, we are reminded of the profound impact that early familial environments and genetic predispositions can have on an individual's emotional development. Through continued reflection and adaptation of therapeutic strategies, we strive to provide the most effective support for our clients, fostering resilience and hope in their journey towards healing.", "causes": "Genetic factors (parents' irritability, anxiety, and basal nucleus developmental problems) and unfavorable family environment (parents' quarrels, divorce, and lack of love), personal history.", "symptoms": "Borderline personality disorder", "treatment_process": "Dialectical behavioral therapy, including cognitive therapy, positive stress reduction, relationship repair and pain tolerance enhancement, combined with medication and exercise.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Emotional instability, impaired interpersonal relationships, sleep problems, suicidal and self-injurious behavior, fear of abandonment and insecurity.", "treatment_effect": "The patient's ability to regulate her emotions was improved, her interpersonal relationships improved, and her symptoms were relieved through treatment."}

This behavior should not be tolerated, and it is important to make a clear statement against it. Parents also have dignity and deserve your respect.

It is important to clearly tell the child: We cannot accept this attitude; it is very impolite to curse at others, and this way will not solve the problem.

It may be hard for them to understand reasoning, so explain to them that being sick means needing to take medicine and get injections, which can be painful.", "9.

This case, in particular, underscores the critical role that parents play in shaping the psychological development and emotional well-being of their children. As I reflect on this journey, I am compelled to delve deeper into the dynamics that were at play, both within the child and the family unit, as well as the therapeutic processes that facilitated transformation.\n\nFrom the outset, the urgency in the father's voice conveyed a profound sense of desperation and helplessness. This initial interaction highlighted a common theme I encounter in my practice: parents often feel overwhelmed when their child deviates from expected norms, especially when traditional methods of discipline and motivation fail to yield results. The father's willingness to reach out across such a distance was indicative of a deep love and commitment to his child's well-being, yet also a reflection of the lack of effective strategies at their disposal.\n\nThe situation was further complicated by the child's previous experiences with boot camps for internet addiction, which had left him with a significant psychological burden. These experiences not only failed to address the underlying issues but also exacerbated his distrust and hostility towards authority figures, including his parents. This is a poignant reminder of the potential harm that can arise from coercive and punitive approaches to behavioral issues, particularly when dealing with adolescents who are at a critical juncture in their emotional and psychological development.\n\nAs I prepared to travel to Chongqing, I was acutely aware of the need for a sensitive and empathetic approach. The challenge was not only to connect with the child but also to help the parents reframe their understanding of their role and influence. The decision to present myself as a classmate of the child's father was a strategic one, aimed at circumventing the child's defenses and creating a space where he felt safe and respected. This initial tactic was crucial in setting the stage for building trust and rapport, which are the cornerstones of any effective therapeutic relationship.\n\nUpon meeting the child, his initial response—characterized by fear and suspicion—was a stark reminder of the profound impact that negative experiences can have on a young person's psyche. It reinforced the importance of approaching each interaction with unconditional positive regard, a fundamental principle of humanistic therapy. By accepting the child as he was, without judgment or criticism, I was able to slowly chip away at the barriers he had erected for self-protection.\n\nEstablishing an emotional connection with the child was a delicate process that required patience and persistence. It involved not only listening to his words but also being attuned to the subtle cues in his behavior and expressions. This active engagement allowed me to empathize with his experiences and validate his feelings, which in turn facilitated a gradual opening up. As trust began to build, it became possible to explore the deeper issues underlying his resistance to school and excessive gaming habits.\n\nSimultaneously, it was imperative to work closely with the parents to transform their approach from one of control and correction to one of support and understanding. The development of the \"Charter of Compliant Parents\" was a pivotal moment in this process. This document served as a tangible commitment to change, encouraging the parents to model the behaviors and attitudes they wished to see in their child. It was a powerful tool for fostering accountability and mutual respect within the family.\n\nAn essential aspect of this case was helping the parents shift their focus from their child's perceived shortcomings to his strengths. The assignment to identify and articulate 36 of his positive attributes was not merely an exercise in positive thinking; it was a transformative process that reshaped their perception of their child. This shift from a deficit-based to a strengths-based perspective is crucial in promoting a child's self-esteem and motivation. When the child saw his strengths recognized and celebrated, it was a moment of validation that bolstered his confidence and encouraged a more positive self-view.\n\nThe structured approach to setting rules and boundaries was another critical element of the therapeutic process. Adolescence is a period marked by a desire for autonomy and self-expression, often leading to conflicts with parental expectations. By collaboratively establishing clear guidelines and consequences, the family was able to create a framework that balanced the child's need for independence with the necessity of maintaining order and respect within the household. This not only reduced conflict but also helped the child understand the rationale behind the rules, fostering a sense of responsibility and self-regulation.\n\nAs the child's behavior began to shift, with a newfound interest in physical activity and a willingness to return to school, it was evident that the changes in the family dynamic were having a positive impact. The parents' commitment to reading and learning alongside their child was a testament to their dedication to ongoing growth and improvement. This mutual engagement in the learning process strengthened the parent-child bond and reinforced the value of education as a collaborative endeavor rather than a source of conflict.\n\nReflecting on this case, I am struck by the profound interconnectedness of individual and familial change. The child's journey towards self-discovery and empowerment was mirrored by the parents' evolution in their parenting approach. This symbiotic relationship underscores the systemic nature of family therapy, where changes in one part of the system reverberate throughout the whole.\n\nThis experience has reinforced my belief in the potential for transformation that lies within every family. It has deepened my understanding of the complexities of parent-child relationships and the importance of adopting a holistic, compassionate approach to therapy. Each case I encounter adds to my repertoire of knowledge and skills, allowing me to refine my practice and offer more nuanced support to those in need.\n\nUltimately, the success of this intervention was not solely due to the techniques employed but to the genuine human connection that was established. It is a reminder that at the heart of effective therapy lies empathy, respect, and the unwavering belief in the capacity for change. As I continue on my professional journey, I carry forward the lessons learned from this case, ever inspired by the resilience and strength of the families I have the privilege to serve.", "causes": "Parents' use of simple and authoritarian parenting methods and deception of the child", "symptoms": "Child dropping out of school", "treatment_process": "The counselor intervened as the child's father's classmate to establish emotional connection, conveyed the concept of scientific parenting, formulated the \"Submissive Parents Charter\" with the parents and the child, allowed the parents to discover the child's strengths, and systematically guided the parents to establish rules and encourage the child to go to school.", "characteristics_of_illness": "The child has Internet addiction, hostile attitude towards studies and teachers, emotional instability, resistance to going out with parents, and lack of inner self-confidence.", "treatment_effect": "The child started running and exercising with his mother, gradually reduced his bad habits, took the initiative to go to school, and had obvious positive changes in his behavior."}

As the only child in a family with modest financial means, his parents are wage earners. The family has ordinary expectations for Liu regarding the college entrance examination, as long as he studies hard and enjoys learning, with no specific requirements for the level of university or choice of major. Liu has always performed well academically, is relatively outgoing, and is recognized as a good student by teachers and classmates. Since childhood, Liu has set higher standards and expectations for himself than his peers. After several weekly tests in his senior year, Liu learned that many of his peers, who previously had similar academic performance, were steadily improving their grades and rankings, while he felt his own performance was subpar. However, Liu has a strong personality and is reluctant to share his frustrations with his parents or classmates. Additionally, he has been experiencing mild health issues, including poor sleep quality and fatigue during classes. He speaks slowly, but his thoughts are relatively clear; his brow is often furrowed, indicating heightened emotional agitation. The biggest challenge for Liu is how to face the upcoming series of mock exams and the college entrance examination.\n\nIn our conversations, Liu mentioned his journey through the learning phase: he has had a relatively easy time with studies since childhood and has never encountered the difficulties he faces now. He has experienced inexplicable insomnia before several tests, often zoning out during classes. After one of the exams, he planned to have dinner with a female classmate on Friday evening and go out shopping together the next morning. However, she informed him that she needed to study and would not join him. Liu ended up eating alone at an off-campus restaurant and later saw that the female classmate had just left another restaurant with a male classmate from their class. Initially, he felt deceived and spent the journey back to school ruminating over the situation, believing the female classmate misunderstood his invitation. That evening, he sent her a text to explain, but she said it was a misunderstanding. Liu also reflected on whether he had developed feelings for her, which troubled him; whenever he had time, he found himself thinking about it. During classes, he often distracted himself with these thoughts, fearing the upcoming college entrance examination in June. Recently, he has been unable to sleep well at night, constantly worrying about not being able to perform normally during the exam. Before the exam, he worried about whether he would sleep poorly, but fortunately, he fell asleep after a short time. Although he did not improve in this exam, at least he did not regress; however, he is now uncertain about how to proceed and how to improve his study efficiency. After communicating with his homeroom teacher, he was advised to \"learn to let go and care less about grades and rankings,\" which he found laughable. He understands that the more anxious he becomes, the worse he performs, but he struggles to achieve that. Some teachers have suggested visiting the counseling center, but initially, he was reluctant to spend time on these matters, wanting to use every moment for studying and striving for success in the next exam, believing that one success would lead to more ease and improved revision efficiency. Yet, due to his mindset and current state, he feels extremely tense during exams, sometimes experiencing mental blanks, often misreading questions, trembling while answering, and sweating profusely. When submitting his paper, he feels conflicted, wishing he could answer a few more questions. The pain of seeing his grades is immense, filled with disappointment in himself and fear of ridicule from classmates. This situation has become increasingly pronounced in recent exams, leaving him unsure of what to do. This exam might have been a turning point, but the incident with the female classmate left him feeling disturbed, fearing that his next exam might be worse than the last.\n\nCase Analysis: During in-depth communication with Liu, I observed that he was reluctant to make direct eye contact with the counselor when discussing the female classmate. While narrating, he tended to look at the ceiling or to the side, occasionally lowering his head to glance down. He spoke slowly, with relatively clear thoughts, but sometimes hesitated or stumbled over his words. When expressing his confusion, his speech was at a moderate pace, maintaining eye contact with the counselor but avoiding prolonged gaze, often accompanied by a helpless smile. His eyes reflected an urgency to resolve his issues, and he would occasionally fidget with his hands, indicating he was not entirely relaxed. It was only after finishing his narration that he let out a long sigh and fell silent.\n\nIn this case, the initial consultation desire of the visiting student was anxiety about exams, which is almost typical for students preparing for exams, stemming from the conflict between goals and current situations. In reality, underlying the anxiety about exams may be various emotions, feelings, and cognitive aspects that need to be re-examined. According to humanistic perspectives, psychological entanglement arises when the characteristic of \"potential\" striving for perfection is obstructed, resulting in an inability to achieve the \"self.\" Therefore, there may still be other expressions or inducements in various aspects. For instance, it is necessary to identify the last straw that broke the camel's back.\n\nDuring the counseling, through calm, patient, and sincere listening, the visitor opened up about his examination phase and the urgent need to overcome his inner turmoil. In the counseling room, he discussed his concerns about the female classmate, further reflecting that his entanglement stemmed from the opinions of others, particularly how he valued their evaluations of him, perhaps including a subtle attachment to his mother. Although seemingly unrelated events in life, in the field of psychology, share a close resemblance: the events may differ, but the emotions and feelings they evoke are similar or the same. Theoretically, it is often said: the problem itself is not the issue; what needs deconstruction and reconstruction is how to view, understand, and recognize its significance. Based on the helper's situation, client-centered therapy was adopted.\n\nOver four consecutive counseling sessions, we explored the positive meanings of academic anxiety alongside its conventional negative implications. I encouraged Liu to confront the objective existence of his study anxiety and to leverage its positive effects. I affirmed his inner growth and his re-evaluation of his circumstances. I encouraged him to contemplate the positive significance and function of academic anxiety, considering how \"study anxiety\" could benefit him. He acknowledged the existence of academic anxiety, expressing gratitude for its reminders and companionship, sincerely hoping to bloom like a sunflower under its \"care.\"\n\nIn a follow-up face-to-face meeting a month later, Liu had largely achieved the expected counseling goals. He appeared resolute and confident, demonstrating an ability to learn more freely and diligently than before, with improved study efficiency, effectively realizing the counseling objectives."], "experience_and_reflection": "In the process of psychological health education and counseling in schools, I strive to combine my personal experiences in frontline teaching with the principles of psychological education, actively practicing the ideas of modern humanistic psychology. This approach is not only an amalgamation of theory and practice but also a reflection of my belief in the profound impact that humanistic principles can have on educational settings. As educators and counselors, we often face the challenge of bridging the gap between academic and emotional development, and it is here that humanistic psychology offers invaluable guidance.\n\nThe case of Liu XX provided a poignant reminder of the multifaceted nature of student anxiety, particularly during the critical period leading up to college entrance examinations. Liu's situation exemplifies the intricate interplay between personal expectations, peer comparisons, and emotional experiences, which can collectively precipitate a heightened state of anxiety. Through this case, I have come to appreciate even more deeply the necessity of viewing students as whole individuals, whose academic and emotional landscapes are intertwined. It is a realization that reinforces the essence of humanistic psychology, which emphasizes understanding individuals in their entirety rather than reducing them to isolated symptoms or issues.\n\nReflecting on Liu's journey, I am reminded of the importance of creating a safe and empathetic environment where students feel comfortable exploring their thoughts and emotions. Liu's reluctance to share his frustrations with his peers and family highlights a common barrier in adolescent counseling: the fear of vulnerability. This is where the humanistic approach, with its core values of empathy, congruence, and unconditional positive regard, becomes crucial. By fostering a therapeutic alliance grounded in these principles, we can encourage students like Liu to open up and engage in the therapeutic process more fully.\n\nIn Liu's case, the anxiety he experienced was not solely about the exams themselves but was also intertwined with his self-perception and the perceptions of others. His reaction to the incident with the female classmate, for instance, was a significant emotional trigger that exacerbated his anxiety. It served as a catalyst for introspection, bringing to light his sensitivity to social judgments and his internal struggle with self-worth. This aspect of the case underscores the importance of addressing not just the academic pressures but also the social and emotional dimensions that contribute to a student's stress.\n\nThroughout the counseling sessions with Liu, I employed client-centered therapy, a hallmark of humanistic psychology, to create a space where Liu could explore these underlying issues without judgment. By focusing on active listening and reflecting back his thoughts and feelings, I aimed to help Liu gain a clearer understanding of his internal conflicts. This process of reflection and self-discovery is central to humanistic psychology and serves as a catalyst for personal growth and change.\n\nOne of the key insights from this case was the realization that academic anxiety, often perceived as solely negative, can also have positive implications. By reframing anxiety as a natural response to challenging situations, we can help students see it as a motivator for preparation and improvement rather than an insurmountable obstacle. This re-evaluation of anxiety aligns with the humanistic emphasis on potential and growth, encouraging students to view their struggles as opportunities for self-improvement and learning.\n\nLiu's case also highlighted the importance of resilience and adaptability in the face of academic challenges. Encouraging students to acknowledge their anxieties while simultaneously leveraging them for personal development can lead to increased self-efficacy and confidence. Through the counseling process, Liu was able to reframe his anxiety, recognizing its role in prompting self-reflection and fostering a deeper understanding of his capabilities and limitations.\n\nAs I reflect on this case, I am struck by the transformative power of the therapeutic relationship. The trust and rapport that developed between Liu and myself were instrumental in facilitating his journey towards self-acceptance and empowerment. This experience reaffirmed my belief in the humanistic principle that the quality of the therapeutic relationship is often more important than the specific techniques employed. By being present, empathetic, and genuine, we can create an environment that nurtures healing and growth.\n\nFurthermore, this case has reinforced the need for proactive psychological education in schools. By integrating psychological principles into everyday educational practices, we can better prepare students to navigate the complexities of academic life. This involves not only addressing immediate concerns but also equipping students with the skills and resilience needed to manage future challenges independently. The principle of \"helping others to help themselves\" is central to this approach, as it empowers students to take an active role in their personal development.\n\nIn conclusion, the case of Liu XX has provided valuable insights into the application of humanistic psychology in educational settings. It has underscored the importance of viewing students as whole individuals, recognizing the interplay between academic pressures and emotional experiences, and fostering a therapeutic environment that encourages self-exploration and growth. As educators and counselors, we have the privilege and responsibility to guide students on their journeys towards self-discovery and fulfillment, helping them to realize their potential and embrace the complexities of their academic and personal lives.

Visitor's General Information: \n   Gender: Female \n   Age: 25 \n   Education: Bachelor's Degree \n   Occupation: Other \n\n2. Main Complaint and Personal Statement: \n   Main Complaint: I'm so angry I'm shaking. I haven't known her for too long, and at first, there wasn't much to it, but I felt she was always a bit strange. For example, she would ask me to bring her things and then give me gifts, always looking embarrassed and blushing. Actually, that wasn't the problem; the key issue is that she constantly tested me, and I picked up on it. I felt she was really great in many ways, and there were things about her that attracted me. You could say she gradually drew me in. However, we didn't make any substantial progress; we just stayed at talking and discussing the future. Slowly, I realized our personalities didn't match. She always wanted to control me, change me, and dominate me. I have my own thoughts, so I wanted to argue back, to break free and be myself. There were many details that led to our disagreements. I also noticed that she seemed to test me constantly. If I got along with someone else, she would be unhappy. If I treated her well, she would have a secretive pleased expression, but then she would be ambiguous. I was really frustrated. One day, I received a message from someone else saying she was in a relationship and had a girlfriend. I was confused—what's going on? Was I overthinking, or was she joking with me? I asked her, and she didn't reply at all. What did she mean? I went to find her, and her girlfriend came out to mock me. I was so compliant that I didn't say anything. I didn't even know how to respond, and she didn't say a word either. I just wanted a clear answer. Was that too much to ask? I was really shaking with anger!\n\n   Personal Statement: Is this your first time having feelings for the same sex? Yes, right? I had a relationship before, with a guy, but it didn't work out, it ended without anything happening. Does she have other admirers? Quite a few, I feel; she is still pretty attractive, looks handsome, mainly because of her charisma. When you say you have many disagreements, which specific areas do you mean? Almost everything, I feel like it's almost everything. So your communication is mostly through arguments, what does that feel like? Not entirely; there are occasionally harmonious moments when we care for each other or consider things for each other. But when it comes to certain habits, like hygiene or how to treat others, it seems impossible. Do you think she is immature and should pay attention to hygiene and social etiquette, or does she think you have shortcomings? It's her; she seems to always want to control me and doesn't like the way I am. Of course, I also see things I don't like about her, like being very strong-willed and wanting to control others. When you say you want to clarify things with her, did you go in a calm manner or a confrontational one? A confrontational one; that's my personality. I've never encountered something like this before. One day everything was fine, and the next day she suddenly announced her relationship with someone else, and she didn't give me a clear answer. She even talked about the future, mentioning bringing her girlfriend home to meet her family, etc. At that time, I thought she was talking about me. Is she sick? If she has no feelings for me, why would she say those things? \n\n3. Information Observed by the Counselor: The visitor spoke very quickly, occasionally choking up as if about to cry, then self-regulated and comforted herself, often criticizing the girl she liked. When recalling the good things about herself, her voice softened, her pace slowed, as if immersed in a pleasant feeling, but she would suddenly snap back to reality, feeling foolish. When evaluating herself, she used crude language, and when criticizing the other person, she often expressed confusion and bewilderment. When discussing whether she really liked the same sex, she interrupted the counselor directly, clarifying her stance that love is love, regardless of whether the partner is male or female, or what animal they are, emphasizing that it is not the key point. She had the energy to slow down her speech, as if the counselor needed guidance in this area. Overall, the visitor exhibited relatively high quality; even when agitated, she apologized for interrupting the counselor and always addressed the counselor as \"you.\" Although her thoughts were often scattered, she showed willpower to bring her thoughts back, frequently asking the counselor, \"Do you think I'm right? Isn't it infuriating?\"\n\n4. Visitor's Main Conditions and Patterns, and the Costs Incurred: \n1. The visitor's family background is normal. As the only girl in the family, she received good care. Due to the family's financial stability, she has never worried about survival. Even her job was well arranged by her family, so she never had to stress about employment. The relationship between her parents and her is quite ordinary; she considers it unimportant, but when she thinks of her parents, she feels a pang of pain, as if she hasn't completely freed them from worry, suggesting she hasn't fully matured. \n2. The visitor has a very lively personality. Despite her pain, she maintains a sense of humor and often makes self-deprecating jokes. However, when she needs to concentrate on her current confusion, she can become serious, summarizing her thoughts word by word, and she often engages the counselor in summarizing the other person's personality. \n3. According to her description, the visitor is someone with many friends and is very generous and appropriate, generally not engaging in disputes. On the contrary, she actively cares for and helps others. Because of this, during the incident, the visitor received a lot of support from friends, especially long-time friends who helped her sort things out. \n4. When asked why, given her friendship support, she still considered psychological counseling, the visitor indicated that she feared burdening her friends by talking too much about her troubles, especially since friends sometimes firmly try to wake her up with their criticisms. She felt she might be saying too much and causing trouble for others, which wouldn't be fair to her friends. This shows that the visitor is quite empathetic. Additionally, due to the special nature of the incident, the range of people she could confide in was relatively limited. \n5. When encouraged to take further steps and see what happens, the visitor strongly rejected the idea, stating that she sought counseling to relieve herself and understand things better; she wouldn't go back to the other person. She also questioned the counselor, asking if she was merely putting on a show to provoke her and get rid of her. After her initial conversation, the visitor opted for a package of counseling sessions, indicating she did not believe a single session could resolve her troubles and had a clear idea of how long it might take to feel better. She exhibited both restlessness and a certain level of clarity.\n\n5. Diagnosis: The visitor has no experience with same-sex love. Encountering such feelings in a particular environment has left her confused. Initially, she didn't discuss how she fell into this emotion. In the two counseling sessions just before the case summary, she mentioned her confusion about what this feeling truly was and took considerable time to research same-sex relationships, including reading numerous reports about homosexuality in her country. After resolving her own confusion, she confirmed her feelings were indeed admiration and that the other person also had feelings for her, leading her to decide to pursue this relationship wholeheartedly. However, due to personality clashes and an inability to establish a relationship, she often found herself confused and distressed. She also mentioned seeing a psychologist (this detail was only revealed during the last counseling session recorded). During that session, the visitor provided the counselor with some notes she had written, from which the counselor discovered that she had spent money on medication to stabilize her emotions. When asked if this was true, the visitor appeared shy and reluctant to discuss it, stating that after getting a few good nights' sleep, she had already recovered and that there was nothing more to say. The visitor resumed her relationship after stabilizing her emotions and sleeping well, looking forward to the future. However, reality did not match her expectations, and she realized that while she could adjust and clarify her own thoughts, she could not grasp the other person's feelings. Therefore, when she found out the other person had a girlfriend, it caught her off guard. Considering her age, mental maturity, and experiences, the visitor has encountered relatively few people and events, leading her to maintain a relatively pure and naive perspective, which made her underestimate the difficulties of situations, causing her to break down instantly. Given her smooth family background and growth experience, her friendships and academic work have never stagnated, and there was almost no interruption in the timeline leading to the counseling, so the diagnosis is categorized as a general psychological issue. \n\n6. Causes of the Problem: \nBiological reasons: No organic lesions. \nSocial reasons: Initially, the visitor had not considered how her family would view her relationship, including their understanding and acceptance of homosexuality. In the last counseling session before the case summary, the visitor mentioned her parents, saying she was glad she didn't truly start this relationship, or else how would she explain it to her parents? Would she have to live in secrecy for a lifetime? The visitor even mentioned that she had considered that being together for a lifetime would require great courage and would present many challenges, including the question of who would give birth if they wanted children in the future. The visitor faced no familial obstacles or influence; her family was unaware of the situation. She could confide in one or two close friends, but she did not discuss deep issues with friends who were unaware of the situation. They might have thought she was merely having conflicts with someone, so they offered significant support to help her see things differently. Her social support was strong, and she did not completely isolate herself without help. \nPsychological reasons: The visitor's emotional turmoil and confusion stemmed not from her same-sex feelings but from her lack of depth in handling situations. Whether in same-sex or opposite-sex relationships, if the other person is avoidant, irresponsible, flirtatious, indecisive, and easily swayed by stronger personalities, the visitor would face the same troubles. Therefore, her counseling approach should not differentiate between same-sex and opposite-sex relationships, as this is not the focus. Instead, the visitor may need to enhance her understanding of human nature, differentiate between love and partner selection, and eliminate psychological factors like one-sided affection, fantasy, and stubbornness. \n\n7. Counseling Goals: \nSpecific Goals: Based on the visitor's curiosity and confusion about that person, to analyze together the other person's behaviors, words, evasive characteristics, personality flaws, and inner psychological issues. Starting from a perspective of dislike and judgment, to help the visitor see the other person as flawed and in need of improvement. The visitor will feel the significant gap between the analyzed person and her idealized perfect partner, allowing her to let go of frustration and anger, and clearly see the incompatibility. \nTimely Counterattack: In the middle of the process, if the other person reaches out to the visitor again to explain the situation and continues to flirt, presenting facts while also appearing critical, the visitor will seek the counselor's advice and, together, they will decide on a course of action. The visitor will strongly counter the other person's advances, letting her know that she is doing well on her own and that the other person is overthinking. This response will greatly encourage the visitor, making her feel she is not a puppet and can control her situation without being swayed by the other person's mixed signals. \nUltimate Goal: The counseling goal is to help the visitor step away from the breakup incident and focus on personal growth, understanding human nature, distinguishing between different individuals, managing love, self-control, and developing long-term personal growth plans. Share many experiences and examples from others, including appropriate disclosures from the counselor, sharing insights from personal growth, etc. This will help the visitor view the entire incident from a higher perspective and understand that the current encounter is just one of many future encounters, and each experience will yield rich rewards. This is not a setback or failure, but rather a valuable gift. \n\n8. Counseling Effect: The visitor has transitioned from being deeply troubled and confused at the beginning to self-summarizing, re-evaluating same-sex love, questioning its suitability for her, contemplating the difficulties involved, and engaging in activities with male friends, traveling, and seeking solace. She has indeed made significant progress in her understanding and inner reflection. At the very least, she no longer fixates on why the other person wouldn't give her an explanation. Instead, she humorously remarks about how others might fall into her trap, recognizing it as a pitfall. In the final few counseling sessions, the visitor expressed some sentimentality, reflecting on the genuine feelings she invested, but this lasted only a few seconds before she laughed it off, calling it just a life's hiccup. The visitor is very conscious of her self-improvement, telling the counselor, \"I want you to help me move on; I don’t want to look back. I even feel like I could throw up just talking about this.\" She has a clear awareness of wanting to move forward, enjoys summarizing, and appreciates being recognized for her progress. Her internal drive and awareness are quite good. In follow-up visits, the visitor provided feedback that included several insightful summaries: \"I think I need to go on blind dates because I've met too few people. I still need to compare more; there's no need to waste time on a loser. Moreover, I’m looking forward to seeing her make a fool of herself; I’ve heard her relationship with her girlfriend is a mess. I really want to enroll in a class; I can't be idle and waste myself. I'm still young, and I need to think more about the future. My parents are getting older, and I want to take good care of them. As for losers and bad things, let them fall apart on their own.\" \n\nCounselor's Theoretical Support During the Counseling Process: \n1. The visitor's emotional reaction was triggered by specific real-life factors, lasting for a relatively short time. Since this emotional response was within her rational control and did not interfere with her work or daily life, nor did it exhibit generalization, it is classified as a temporary psychological unhealthiness, belonging to general psychological issues. \n2. From the beginning to the end, the visitor did not connect her negative emotional reactions from this event to other events or people. In the meantime, she took leisure trips and engaged with male partners, finding joy in the experience. She only occasionally experienced slight emotional fluctuations when recalling past events. Therefore, during counseling, the counselor intensified her dislike for the other person, analyzing their flaws while also highlighting the various challenges she might face in same-sex relationships and the darker aspects of the other person's psychology, drawing from the aversion therapy techniques, particularly the imagined aversion therapy. (Initially, the visitor's attachment emotions were very strong; every time she mentioned this same-sex person, her tone was filled with sorrow, and one could feel her deep pain. To prevent her from excessively reminiscing about this attachment, she was encouraged to quickly detach from her unrealistic fantasies about the other person.)"], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on Ms. A's case has provided a unique opportunity to delve deeper into the complexities of human emotions and the intricate interplay of personal experiences and societal expectations. Ms. A's journey was marked by a profound internal struggle, which, while initially centered around her feelings for someone of the same sex, ultimately became a broader exploration of self-identity, personal growth, and the navigation of interpersonal relationships.\n\nOne of the central themes that emerged from our sessions was the notion of love as a projection of internal desires and expectations. Ms. A's attraction to another woman was not merely a reflection of her sexual orientation but also a manifestation of her search for qualities she admired and perhaps felt lacking in herself. This realization brought to light the importance of understanding love not just as a static feeling but as a dynamic interplay of personal aspirations and the characteristics we seek in others to complement or complete ourselves. \n\nMs. A's initial confusion and subsequent clarity about her feelings underscore the complexity of human emotions. It was crucial to help her discern between admiration and romantic love, a distinction that often becomes blurred, especially when one's feelings are new and unexplored. In our sessions, we focused on unraveling these layers, encouraging Ms. A to reflect on what she truly valued in a partner and what these values revealed about her own identity and personal growth trajectory. \n\nThe societal context of Ms. A's experience cannot be overlooked. She navigated her feelings in an environment where homosexuality, while increasingly accepted, still carries varying degrees of stigma. This societal backdrop added an additional layer of complexity to her emotional turmoil. It became evident that part of her struggle was not just with her feelings but also with the potential implications of those feelings in her social and familial circles. Ms. A's reflections on how her family might perceive her relationship highlight the societal pressures that often accompany personal revelations about sexual orientation. \n\nThrough this case, I realized the delicate balance between empathizing with a client's sexual orientation and providing guidance that aligns with broader societal norms. It became a point of introspection, questioning how much of my guidance was influenced by my perspectives versus what Ms. A truly needed. This tension between providing a safe space for exploration and inadvertently steering the client towards a more conventional path was palpable throughout our sessions. While Ms. A accepted the guidance, it remains a point of reflection whether this was the best approach or a reflection of my biases as a counselor.\n\nThe therapeutic approach employed in this case was multifaceted, integrating elements of aversion therapy to help Ms. A detach from her idealized perception of the other person. This method proved effective in mitigating her emotional distress and redirecting her focus towards personal development and future aspirations. However, it also raised questions about the long-term implications of such an approach. By encouraging detachment, did we overlook the opportunity for Ms. A to fully process and understand the depth of her feelings? Was there room for deeper exploration of her emotional experiences beyond the immediate need to alleviate distress?\n\nMs. A's case also highlighted the importance of fostering self-awareness and resilience. As she progressed through counseling, she developed a more nuanced understanding of her emotions and a clearer vision for her future. This shift from a place of confusion to one of empowerment is a testament to her inner strength and willingness to confront uncomfortable truths. Her ability to humorously reflect on her past experiences and recognize them as part of her life's journey speaks to a maturity that belies her age. \n\nThe role of social support in Ms. A's journey was another critical element. Her network of friends provided a buffer against isolation and offered diverse perspectives that enriched her understanding of her situation. This support network, coupled with her counseling sessions, allowed Ms. A to process her emotions in a constructive manner, illustrating the importance of community and connection in navigating personal crises.\n\nReflecting on the broader implications of this case, it becomes clear that the therapeutic journey is as much about the counselor's growth as it is about the client's. Each session with Ms. A was a learning experience, challenging my assumptions and broadening my understanding of the human condition. It underscored the need for counselors to remain open to diverse experiences and to continuously reflect on their practices to ensure they meet the unique needs of each client.\n\nIn conclusion, Ms. A's case was a poignant reminder of the complexities inherent in human relationships and the profound impact of societal expectations on personal identity. It emphasized the importance of creating a therapeutic space that honors the client's journey while gently guiding them towards personal growth and self-discovery. As Ms. A moves forward, I am hopeful that the insights gained from her counseling experience will continue to serve her well, allowing her to embrace future challenges with confidence and clarity.", "causes": "lack of homosexual experience, personality conflict, family social influence.", "symptoms": "Emotional instability, anxiety, self-perception confusion.", "treatment_process": "using aversion therapy, analyzing each other's shortcomings, guiding detachment, and helping to reevaluate emotions.", "characteristics_of_illness": "same-sex emotional distress, idealized partner, doubts about self-identity.", "treatment_effect": "Successfully get rid of the disturbance, self-improvement consciousness increased, able to look at the past with humor."}
{"id": 164, "case_description": ["Visitor, female, 32 years old, bachelor's degree, civil servant, from Tangshan City, Hebei Province. Married for 5 years. For the past 5 years, she has not had children due to intermittent medication. The visitor reports symptoms: she has anxiety disorder, and recently underwent major surgery. Shortly after the surgery, her anxiety disorder relapsed, feeling quite severe, with inexplicable irritability every day, sometimes experiencing chest tightness and a burning sensation in her back. She has been taking medication for control but has not fully recovered. A long time ago, she visited a private counseling clinic and had a few psychological consultations, but felt the effects were not very good and did not continue."], "consultation_process": ["Consultation objective: How to overcome the troubles of anxiety disorder?", "3. Consultation Process: For the past five years of marriage, I have been intermittently taking medication to manage my condition, but I have never fully recovered. I don't know how to alleviate my feelings, so I hope to find some comfort from my teacher. I believe that by following my teacher's advice and truly implementing it, I can heal; I just don't know how to proceed right now. It seems I understand the reasoning, but when anxiety strikes, I can't apply it. I know that anxiety stems from subconscious fears, and understanding this and accepting it should help alleviate the symptoms. I hope to find a way out of my self-imposed anxiety with the help of my teacher! My main issue is that I put too much pressure on myself and find myself unconsciously dwelling on my anxiety problems. Five years ago, I had heart surgery, and right after the surgery, I coincidentally had to deal with my family's house construction, coupled with my own heavy thoughts, which led to this psychological issue. I labeled myself with a psychological problem, which was then amplified by doctors, resulting in insomnia and increasing pressure, along with physical symptoms like menstrual irregularities. Later, to combat anxiety, I kept eating snacks, which led to weight gain. My partner is someone who doesn't seem to feel urgency; after we got married, he went to work in another city and only comes back once a month, staying for a week. I have lost interest in everything due to anxiety and prefer to live alone, feeling lazy to go out. When I feel slightly better, I stop taking medication. With medication, I can sleep better; before, I could sleep for five hours with sleeping pills, and now I can also sleep for five hours without them, but I tend to dream a lot. I no longer take anti-anxiety medication! The visitor has just undergone a major surgery and is currently on leave at home. She interprets the cause of her illness as: high pressure leading to anxiety, and long-term anxiety resulting in physical problems, which eventually led to surgery. After the surgery, she became even more worried and anxious about her issues, which could lead to a recurrence of her condition or trigger other physical problems. The visitor mentioned that she has read many professional books on this subject and often looks at articles online; she understands some principles, such as: anxiety arises from inner fear, and she fears anxiety itself. Initially, she would complain, \"Why did anxiety disorder choose me?\" When she first developed anxiety disorder, her physical symptoms included trembling hands and feet, and stomach pain. Now those initial symptoms are gone, but she has developed chest tightness and shortness of breath, as well as burning sensations in her back. To alleviate her anxiety disorder, she has tried yoga, reading, writing, drawing, running, exercising, and traveling, but these methods only provide temporary relief and do not address the root problem. She remembers reading a book whose theory she agrees with, which explains well: pressure directed inward leads to depression; pressure directed outward leads to panic and anxiety. The author refers to these as \"neurotic disorders\" or neurasthenia, caused by overthinking (neurosis is not a physiological issue but a problem with human thinking). Insomnia, anxiety, and depression influence and drive each other, forming a vicious cycle. If she suggests to herself before sleeping that it will cause anxiety, she subconsciously resists sleep. If she goes out to play and tires herself out, she sleeps better. On weekends, she sleeps better because she doesn't have to worry about work the next day. Now, she is afraid of living alone and fears loneliness. Later, the counselor performed \"imagery dialogue therapy\" with the visitor, and the results were particularly good; she felt liberated from the troubles of anxiety disorder and found this therapy to be truly magical!", "Case Analysis: \"Anxiety arises when humanity realizes that they cannot dominate themselves, and that their perceptions and behaviors are controlled by irrational forces.\" Therefore, we create science and religion to explain various phenomena, finding an explanation that allows us to control the incomprehensible. For example, when we find ourselves in an emotional low and can't seem to escape, we receive a diagnosis from a psychiatrist: you have anxiety disorder or depression. Although this is not cheerful news, it seems to provide a temporary sense of stability, and this result simultaneously points to a clear direction for treatment, allowing one to see a glimmer of hope in the darkness. However, whether it is anxiety disorder, depression, insomnia, or obsessive-compulsive disorder, they are all psychological issues. They are neither physical diseases nor diseases of physiological organs; their existence is entirely due to problems in your thinking, leading to a temporary imbalance of neurotransmitters in the brain. They cannot be resolved simply through persuasion from others or self-adjustment and encouragement. Although my clients wish to change and make a comeback through various methods like medication and exercise, they are not very successful and do not address the fundamental issues. This is because medication can only effectively relieve the physical symptoms brought on by anxiety; it cannot solve the problems in thinking. So what can be done? Ultimately, one must turn to psychotherapy. Psychotherapy can help clients explore the deeper root causes of their anxiety. Additionally, the presence of another person in psychotherapy helps to repair the effects of past traumatic experiences and addresses unhealthy relationship patterns behind the symptoms, such as interpersonal loneliness, feelings of alienation, lack of support, and inner strength, which have a distinctly beneficial effect that other forms of help do not provide.", "6. Reflection on the success or failure of consultation goals: Before the consultation began, the principles and workflow of psychological counseling were explained to the client, which lowered their expectations for the goals of the first session, helping to increase their satisfaction with the outcomes. After discussing with the client, the consultation time was set for one and a half hours, allowing for half an hour dedicated to an \"Imagery Dialogue,\" which yielded relatively ideal results.", "Sixth, the effect of this consultation: I think the process of \"imagery dialogue\" went quite smoothly this time, and the results were relatively good. It was obvious to feel the changes in the visitor's emotions, and they came out on their own! The visitor said: \"In the past, just thinking about anxiety made me feel fear and dread, as if I would never be able to get rid of it in this lifetime. Through imagery dialogue, I now dare to face it directly and have a conversation with it. After talking to it, I feel that anxiety is not so terrifying anymore; I can even be friends with 'anxiety'!\""], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflection on the consultation process:\n\nThe use of \"imagery dialogue\" as a therapeutic technique in this case proved to be a pivotal intervention in managing the client's anxiety disorder. Imagery dialogue, often referred to in narrative therapy as \"externalized dialogue,\" serves as a powerful tool within expressive arts therapy. This approach encourages clients to engage in a creative and symbolic conversation with their anxiety, allowing them to externalize and personify their internal struggles. In this case, the client experienced a profound shift in her relationship with anxiety, transforming it from an overwhelming internal force into an entity she could confront and engage with more objectively.\n\nReflecting on the successful outcome, it becomes evident that the consultant's confidence and seriousness during the dialogue significantly influenced the client's willingness to engage. This underscores the importance of the therapist's role as a facilitator, guiding the client through the process with empathy and assurance. The trust and rapport established between the therapist and the client were crucial in enabling the client to open up and explore her anxiety in a non-threatening manner.\n\nOne of the key insights from this experience is the potential of imagery dialogue to depathologize the client's experience of anxiety. The client's initial labeling by medical professionals had intensified her fear and psychological burden, creating a vicious cycle of anxiety. By externalizing the anxiety and engaging in a dialogue, the client was able to reduce the stigma associated with her condition, viewing it as a challenge to be addressed rather than an insurmountable defect.\n\nThe presence of the client's husband during the consultation presented an interesting dynamic. Initially perceived as disruptive, his involvement highlighted the importance of considering the broader relational context in therapy. In postmodern counseling, acknowledging all individuals as potential resources is vital. Future sessions could explore involving significant others in the therapeutic process more deliberately. Encouraging the husband to participate in the imagery dialogue might foster a shared understanding and support system, enhancing the client's recovery journey.\n\nAnother critical aspect is the role of physical intimacy and close relationships in alleviating anxiety. The client's long-distance relationship with her husband appeared to exacerbate her emotional distress. Physical contact, such as hugging, has been shown to release oxytocin, promoting happiness and reducing anxiety and depression. Encouraging the client to explore ways to maintain emotional closeness with her partner, even at a distance, could be beneficial. Incorporating relational dynamics into the therapeutic framework acknowledges the interconnectedness of psychological well-being and interpersonal relationships.\n\nThe client’s journey underscores the complexity of anxiety disorders and the multifaceted nature of effective treatment. While medication can alleviate physical symptoms, it does not address the underlying cognitive and emotional patterns. This case reinforces the necessity of psychotherapy as a means to delve into the root causes of anxiety, helping clients unravel deep-seated fears and dysfunctional thinking patterns. By addressing these foundational issues, clients can work towards sustainable change and break free from the cycle of anxiety.\n\nMoreover, the client's history of various coping mechanisms, such as yoga, reading, and exercise, highlights the importance of integrating holistic approaches into therapy. These activities, while providing temporary relief, did not address the core issues. Incorporating them into a broader therapeutic strategy that includes imagery dialogue and cognitive restructuring could enhance their effectiveness. Encouraging the client to engage in these activities with mindfulness and intention may help reinforce the insights gained during therapy.\n\nThe client's engagement with professional literature and self-education on anxiety is noteworthy. This proactive approach reflects a desire for self-understanding and empowerment. Therapy can build on this foundation by guiding the client in applying theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios. Facilitating discussions on how anxiety manifests in her life and exploring personalized strategies for managing it can empower the client to take an active role in her recovery.\n\nFinally, the reflection on the suitability of guided imagery dialogue for different clients is crucial. While this technique proved effective in this case, it may not be appropriate for everyone. The client's readiness to engage in such a process was supported by a strong therapeutic alliance and her inherent courage to face her fears. Assessing a client’s preparedness and ensuring they have the requisite confidence is essential before employing such techniques.\n\nIn conclusion, this case illustrates the transformative potential of imagery dialogue in treating anxiety disorders. By externalizing and engaging with anxiety, clients can shift their perspectives, reduce stigma, and develop healthier relationships with their emotions. The therapist’s role in facilitating this process with empathy, confidence, and an understanding of the client’s relational dynamics is paramount.

{"id": 165, "case_description": ["The psychology of men and women in love is different. Learn to understand each other. At the same time, let go of past entanglements, focus on future solutions, and seek common ground."], "consultation_process": ["When the visitor entered, before even sitting down, he said, \"I've just experienced a breakup.\" I felt a bit uneasy because I really didn't have much experience in this area and almost no practical experience myself, just like being looked down upon by my son: \"You only had one relationship before getting married, so don't come to me for advice.\" But who says a doctor can only treat cancer patients if they've had cancer themselves? This metaphor might not be entirely appropriate, but it's enough for me to use as a defense. Let’s hear what he has to say first. \"Tell me about your situation.\" He was quite clear in his thinking. In essence, he had been dating a beautiful girlfriend, felt a strong connection, and loved her, but he had no idea whether she loved him back. So, this wasn’t really a breakup issue, but rather a question of confirming whether she loved him. \"Alright, why don’t you start by telling me the evidence you think shows she loves you?\" Generally speaking, male visitors tend to be more rational and organized in their thoughts. He had some ideas in mind. If I had asked this question to a female visitor, I would probably have received a tangled mess of answers, requiring the counselor to spend more time sorting it out. \"Let me list it out; I've actually thought about this for a long time.\" He enumerated the evidence that the girl loved him and how good she was to him, which clearly reflected the logic of a science-minded person. Just like the belief in focal technology, every visitor has already been anxious and contemplative about their situation for a long time before seeking help; they are definitely experts on their own issues. With such strong evidence, what is there to be conflicted about? \"Why do you still feel that she doesn't love you? What’s your evidence?\" He hesitated for a moment but eventually listed some reasons. For example, the girl seemed to be enthusiastic toward everyone, not just him. She was good to him, but had never seriously said she loved him; it was always him telling her he loved her, making him feel like he might be the only one with feelings. Lastly, he mentioned that she often complained that he didn’t know how to comfort people. She felt there was no warmth from him, unlike her first love who was passionate and warm. If she doesn't feel warmth from you, why would she want to date you? You clearly seem to be the one with unrequited feelings, but I couldn't directly hit him with that. Besides, it might not really be the case. So, I asked him back, \"Do you know the difference between liking and loving? Do you think she merely likes you, or does she love you?\" \"I don't know if she loves me; I just know that I truly love her because the feeling of being with her is something I've never experienced before. When she is with me, I don't want to do anything else; I just want to be with her, saying nothing, doing nothing. She seems to have said that she likes being with me, just goofing around without going anywhere or doing anything.\" It sounded like he was still the one with unrequited feelings. \"I just heard you say she feels no warmth from you. Why would she say that?\" Upon mentioning this, he suddenly became excited: \"I forgot to tell you something.\" This way of expressing herself had only come up in the past few months; she hadn't been like this before. She had met a wealthy man who was willing to spend lavishly on her and was particularly good at doing various things for her. For example, he would send her flowers and write poems in her group chat, give her flowers and red envelopes for holidays, and invite her out to dinner on various occasions. The problem was that she would share their conversations with him, saying that was the warmth she liked. All of this drove him crazy because of the nature of his job, their schedules were always mismatched, and being just a regular employee, he couldn't possibly spend that much money on her. \"Are you saying you think she's a materialistic girl?\" If a materialistic girl encounters a science-minded guy, he basically has no chance. But why would she often show him the chat records with the wealthy guy? \"That shouldn’t be the case,\" he explained, saying the girl had a good job and income, was well-mannered, and very smart, with high character and temperament. She never used his money and would never accept money from the wealthy man; she had basically returned all the large red envelopes he sent her. \"The willingness of others to spend on her makes her feel particularly warm. But you can’t do that, right?\" In fact, it should be said that most girls are not materialistic; they just like men who are willing to invest in them, that kind of foolish devotion. \"Yes.\" The subsequent topics seemed to revolve entirely around that wealthy man. Ever since the wealthy man appeared in her life, it was clear he was relentlessly pursuing her. That kind of aggressive pursuit is something an ordinary girl would struggle to resist; that man had completely taken on the role of a warm confidant, like a big brother, a place to dock when tired, a shelter to escape reality. All of this made the visitor feel hopeless, as if all his struggles and efforts were futile. \"If she really fell in love with that wealthy man, why would she still be dating you? Why would she show you their chat records?\" The counselor could only assist the visitor in sorting through his thoughts, confronting the different voices within him. \"Because she always denies that she loves him. So sometimes I feel like she just hopes I can be as warm as he is.\" He also believed that the girl truly loved him, not the wealthy man. After all, the girl had said that businessmen are unreliable; there's no such thing as a business without deception. \"You think the girl doesn’t love that wealthy man but loves you instead?\" I continued to challenge him. \"Yes, her not loving that wealthy man doesn't necessarily mean she loves me.\" The poor boy smiled bitterly; it was so easy for me to drag him into this back-and-forth, with two sides of himself constantly in contention. He began to blame himself for his low emotional intelligence, feeling unable to become what the girl wanted. He couldn't pursue her like the wealthy man, spending money and time, nor could he be more artistic like her, sharing more common interests. He kept disappointing the girl, and after the wealthy man's appearance, he became increasingly insecure. This state tortured him, making it hard for him to break free. The more he spoke, the more inferior he felt, describing himself as being worthless. This was not the outcome I wanted; as a counselor, I should empower him, giving the visitor the strength to take action rather than letting him feel stuck and retreat. \"Wait a minute.\" I quickly called for a stop, \"When the girl decided to date you, were those advantages you had still present?\" \"My biggest advantage should be persistence!\" He began to follow my guidance to talk about his strengths. He is someone who can stick to his goals, no matter the difficulties he faces. Although he is not very smart, he works hard and sets tasks for himself, moving forward a little each day toward his goals. Because he isn’t clever enough, the goals he sets for himself are few and simple but are lifelong pursuits. As a man, life must have goals. If you keep circling around a woman, you are doomed to failure. Of course, being without a partner is also incomplete; he went on to explain various points. This long discourse even left me a bit stunned, as it seemed his emotional intelligence wasn’t low after all. \"So what should you do?\" Action, no matter what his choice is, he still needs to take action. \"Alright, I know what I need to do.\" He seemed to have understood something and thanked me before leaving. But I also didn't know what he had understood, or what confusions lay ahead for him. A girl encountering a boy like him should be quite happy, but there would also be some worries and confusions. However, I still don’t know how the girl truly feels; she hasn’t come to me. Perhaps there are still some things that cause them to torment each other, creating misunderstandings between them. In modern society, the more developed communication becomes, the more misunderstandings arise, making communication more difficult. As a result, there are more and more single men and women, and the divorce rate continues to rise."], "experience_and_reflection": "The consultation of a psychological counselor requires a careful understanding of the client's mental state. Accompanying the client is like walking a dark road at night, with the counselor holding a flashlight behind them. How to find their way through the fog and which path to choose is the client's responsibility, while illuminating the bumps and intersections beneath their feet is the counselor's task.\n\nReflecting on this particular case, I've come to appreciate the complexity of human emotions and relationships, especially in the context of love and marriage. The situation presented by the client offers a rich tapestry of interpersonal dynamics that are both challenging and enlightening. As a psychological counselor, my role was to facilitate clarity and empower the client to navigate his emotional landscape with greater insight and confidence.\n\nOne of the initial challenges in this case was the client's perception of love and the distinction between love and liking. It was evident that his feelings were deeply rooted, yet there was an apparent disconnect in understanding his girlfriend's emotions. This disconnect is not uncommon in romantic relationships, where communication can be muddled by individual insecurities and external influences. The client was grappling with the notion of unrequited love, which is a potent source of emotional turmoil. His struggle was not just with the idea that his girlfriend might not love him, but with the ambiguity surrounding her feelings. This ambiguity is a common theme in many relationships and often leads to misinterpretations and false assumptions.\n\nThe client's rational approach to understanding love through evidence is indicative of a cognitive style that values logic and order. However, love, by nature, is often irrational and chaotic. The client's list of reasons why he believed his girlfriend loved him demonstrated his attempt to make sense of his emotional experience through a scientific lens. This approach can be both a strength and a limitation. It allows for a systematic evaluation of the situation but may also overlook the emotional nuances that do not conform to logical analysis.\n\nDuring the consultation, it became apparent that the client's self-worth was intertwined with his perception of the relationship. His feelings of inadequacy were exacerbated by the presence of a wealthy man, who seemed to embody the warmth and attentiveness the client felt he lacked. This external comparison led to a deep-seated insecurity, manifesting in self-blame and feelings of inferiority. The wealthy man's actions were perceived as a threat, not because of the material gifts, but because they symbolized a form of affection and devotion the client feared he could not replicate.\n\nIt's important to note that the client's focus on materialism was a reflection of societal norms that equate financial generosity with emotional investment. This perception can be misleading, as genuine emotional connections are often built on intangible qualities such as trust, empathy, and mutual respect. The client's acknowledgment that his girlfriend returned the wealthy man's monetary gifts suggested a deeper understanding of her character, yet his fear of losing her to a more flamboyant suitor overshadowed this insight.\n\nThroughout the session, the client oscillated between hope and despair, a common emotional pattern in individuals facing relational uncertainty. This oscillation is rooted in the human tendency to hold onto hope despite evidence to the contrary. It's a survival mechanism that protects the individual from the full weight of rejection but can also prolong emotional suffering.\n\nAs a counselor, my task was to guide the client towards self-reflection, helping him identify his strengths and the unique qualities that initially attracted his girlfriend. Persistence was identified as his core strength, a trait that can be both admirable and burdensome. While persistence in pursuing goals is commendable, it can also lead to a fixation that blinds the individual to other opportunities or solutions. Encouraging the client to balance his persistence with flexibility was crucial in helping him see beyond his immediate predicament.\n\nThe client's journey through self-discovery and understanding was a reminder of the delicate balance between vulnerability and resilience in the therapeutic process. Empowering him to take action involved fostering a sense of agency, helping him recognize that his choices, rather than external circumstances, would ultimately shape his future. This empowerment is central to the therapeutic relationship, where the counselor's role is to support the client in navigating his inner world with greater autonomy.\n\nReflecting on the broader implications of this case, it's clear that modern communication technologies, while facilitating connection, can also contribute to misunderstandings. The ease of sharing information can lead to misinterpretations and conflicts that arise from differing communication styles and emotional expressions. This paradox is a growing challenge in contemporary relationships, where digital interactions can obscure genuine emotional intentions.\n\nThe rising rates of single individuals and divorces underscore the need for deeper emotional literacy and communication skills in relationships. As a counselor, it is imperative to equip clients with the tools to navigate these complexities, fostering resilience and understanding in the face of relational challenges. This case serves as a poignant reminder of the intricate dynamics of love and the importance of maintaining open, honest communication to bridge gaps in understanding.\n\nIn conclusion, this case has reinforced the multifaceted nature of love and relationships, highlighting the importance of balancing rational analysis with emotional insight. As a psychological counselor, my ongoing reflection and learning from each case contribute to a more nuanced understanding of human behavior, enabling me to better support my clients in their unique journeys.", "causes": "disconnected emotional perception of girlfriend, threatened by affluent men, external comparison and insecurity.", "symptoms": "emotional distress, low self-worth", "treatment_process": "guided self-reflection, identifying one's strengths, encouraging action, promoting self-discovery and understanding.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Emotional ambiguity, symptomatic vacillation.", "treatment_effect": "some understanding but may still be confused in the future, need for continued exploration and growth."}
{"id": 166, "case_description": ["Visitor, female, 17 years old, a second-year high school student. Her father is a tutor outside of school, and her mother works in a public institution. She is the only daughter in the family, and her grandparents also love her very much! Her father is the eldest son in the family and does not care for or look after the children; the daughter has had a poor relationship with her father since childhood, and he often hits her! Her mother said that the daughter has been weak and sickly since she was little! During the first half of this year, at the beginning of the school term, the daughter caught a severe cold and stayed home for half a month, and it seemed that she had not fully recovered before returning to school. A few days later, her condition relapsed, and she stayed home for another week. Since then, the child has frequently experienced unexplained symptoms such as dizziness, headaches, poor appetite, chest tightness, and difficulty breathing, along with constant body aches and discomfort. Her exam scores have dropped from over 40th place in her grade to over 120th. According to her mother, since the first half of her second year, the daughter has often felt frustrated, constantly complaining of discomfort and unwilling to go to school, and she has no friends at school. With the third year of high school approaching, how can the daughter cope with next year's college entrance examination in such a weak and sickly state? Recently, her mother has taken her to various hospitals of all sizes across Tianjin, from the First Central Hospital of Tianjin to local clinics, but the diagnoses all indicate that there is nothing wrong. Finally, her mother suspects that the daughter has psychological issues. The consultation lasted for two hours and 30 minutes.", "Consultation time: July 29, 2018, from 2:00 PM to 4:30 PM."], "consultation_process": ["3. Consultation objective: To find out what strange illness my daughter has.", "IV. Consultation Process: When the door of the consultation room was pushed open, a close-knit mother and daughter appeared, chatting and laughing. Were they here for a consultation? I had a question mark in my mind! I asked the daughter if she wanted her mother to be present during the consultation. The daughter said it was fine; there were no secrets between them. Having her mother there might actually be a great resource for our consultation! The daughter mentioned that she was just feeling unwell, didn't know what her problem was, and didn't have much to say! At that moment, I felt that this consultation might not go very smoothly. I then asked the mother how she viewed her daughter's issues. The mother said her daughter might have lacked paternal love since childhood, that she was quite assertive, and that her husband was like a child without a sense of family responsibility. In just a few short sentences, my professional sensitivity prompted me to casually ask the daughter, \"What kind of person do you think your father is?\" To my surprise, the daughter immediately burst into tears: \"Although we live under the same roof, there is no affection; I cannot accept my father in my heart!\" Then, while crying, the daughter began to vent her frustrations about her father: he is a selfish person, a tutor outside of school who doesn't earn much, yet spends money on branded clothes and often uses her mother's money to satisfy his own vanity. The father contributed little to the family; last year when they bought a house, he only lent them 20,000 yuan, and out of that, 10,000 yuan was spent by him on a mobile phone (it seems this mother-daughter relationship is truly open, and the daughter is deeply involved in the conflicts between her parents!). The mother spoke very little, quietly listening to her daughter's account, only saying, \"Father never appreciates his daughter.\" Next, the daughter began to express her inner cowardice and fear, recounting the times she needed her father, only to find him absent or merely \"mocking\" her from the sidelines with sarcastic remarks. The visitor detailed two deeply memorable events from her childhood: first, the fear she felt as a child when receiving an injection, with only her grandmother and mother present, holding the cotton on the injection site for her! Second, when she was in the fifth grade (at 12 years old), she had an appendectomy, during which she faced immense fear. The parents, grandparents, and other family members of a girl in the adjacent bed were present, but her father only came to see her twice during her 7-day hospital stay, hardly saying a word before leaving!"], "experience_and_reflection": "The case of the 17-year-old high school student presents a complex interplay of familial dynamics and adolescent development challenges, which reflect deeper issues within the family structure. Upon further reflection, it becomes evident that the daughter's psychological and physical symptoms are symptomatic of a larger systemic imbalance, manifesting through her relationship with her father and the alliance formed with her mother. \n\nTo understand the root of these challenges, we must delve into the family dynamics that have shaped the daughter's experience. The family structure resembles not an inverted equilateral triangle, as is ideal, but rather a skewed configuration wherein the mother and daughter are closely allied against the father, who is marginalized. This marginalization of the father has significant ramifications. The daughter’s resentment and disdain towards her father are palpable, and this emotional turmoil is likely exacerbated by the lack of paternal involvement and support during critical moments in her life. \n\nThe daughter’s physical symptoms—dizziness, headaches, poor appetite, chest tightness, and difficulty breathing—can be viewed as manifestations of her emotional distress. These symptoms, coupled with her declining academic performance, suggest a psychosomatic condition, where emotional pain is expressed through physical discomfort. The narrative therapy session allowed the daughter to articulate her suppressed emotions, revealing her profound anger and rejection of her father. This emotional release is crucial in understanding the psychosomatic nature of her symptoms. \n\nThe mother’s role in this dynamic is equally significant. Her calm demeanor during the consultation, contrasted with her daughter's emotional outpouring, suggests a history of emotional suppression within the family. The mother’s alliance with her daughter against the father has inadvertently placed the daughter in a protective role, reversing the expected family hierarchy and burdening the daughter with adult concerns. This alliance, while providing emotional support to the mother, has deprived the daughter of a balanced parental relationship and has perpetuated the conflict with her father. \n\nReflecting on the success or failure of the consultation, it is apparent that the daughter’s breakdown was a pivotal moment. Her emotional collapse upon discussing her father’s shortcomings indicates a longstanding suppression of feelings. The consultation provided a safe space for her to express these emotions, which may have been bottled up for years. The mother’s passive participation suggests a tacit acceptance of the daughter’s narrative, reinforcing the negative image of the father constructed by both mother and daughter. This narrative, while rooted in genuine grievances, may also be influenced by the mother’s unresolved issues with her husband, which have been passed on to the daughter. \n\nThe narrative therapy approach facilitated a shift in the daughter's perception of her father. Initially, her assessment of her father was overwhelmingly negative, but through the process of the consultation, she was able to reevaluate this perception, acknowledging both negative and positive aspects. This shift from a 1:99 ratio of good to bad to 40:60 indicates a significant change in her narrative, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of her father’s role in her life. \n\nThe effect of the consultation was immediate, as evidenced by the mother’s feedback indicating a dramatic improvement in the daughter’s emotional and physical well-being. This outcome highlights the power of narrative therapy in addressing adolescent issues, where the resolution of oppressive narratives can lead to rapid emotional healing. The daughter's newfound perspective on her father suggests that she has begun to integrate a more balanced narrative, recognizing her father’s contributions, albeit limited, and the possibility of positive interactions in the future. \n\nIn considering the broader implications of this case, it is essential to examine the role of narrative therapy in facilitating change within family systems. The approach focuses on the strengths and abilities of the client, encouraging the development of preferred narratives that empower rather than oppress. In this case, the therapist acted as a facilitator, guiding the daughter to explore her narrative and discover alternative meanings that challenge the established family dynamics. This process is not about diagnosing or teaching but entering an interactive space that fosters awareness and growth.\n\nThe case also underscores the importance of addressing familial alliances and conflicts in therapy. The mother's alliance with her daughter against the father has perpetuated a cycle of emotional distress and psychosomatic symptoms. By acknowledging and addressing these dynamics, therapy can help realign the family structure, fostering healthier relationships and communication. \n\nMoving forward, it is crucial to consider how this newfound awareness can be integrated into the daughter's daily life. The therapist can support the daughter in developing strategies to navigate her relationship with her father, promoting open communication and understanding. Additionally, the mother may benefit from exploring her role in the family dynamics, recognizing how her actions may influence her daughter’s perceptions and experiences. \n\nIn conclusion, this case highlights the transformative potential of narrative therapy in addressing adolescent adaptation issues within complex family dynamics. The daughter's journey towards a more balanced narrative reflects her resilience and capacity for change, offering hope for improved familial relationships and emotional well-being. As a clinician, the insights gained from this case reinforce the importance of addressing systemic issues and fostering open narratives that empower clients to redefine their stories and embrace positive change.", "causes": "Family imbalance, father's indifference, mother-daughter confrontation.", "symptoms": "Psychological problems leading to physical discomfort", "treatment_process": "Narrative therapy was used to guide reassessment of the father figure.", "characteristics_of_illness": "emotional distress manifested through physical discomfort.

Source of clients: 525 Psychological Counseling Network", "Consultation goal: How can I escape the grip of suicide?", "V. Consultation Process: The visitor divorced his ex-wife six years ago and has been living a single life since then. He believes that his ex-wife divorced him because he had no money and that she looked down on him, which motivated him to work hard to earn money after the divorce. Later, he accepted a 50-something-year-old woman as his godmother, who introduced him to a high-profit, multi-level marketing-style investment scheme. Due to his decisive withdrawal, he managed to make his first fortune of over 200,000 yuan while most others lost money. Subsequently, with the help of a friend, he contracted a project and made his second fortune. Once he had money, he began to lead a reckless life, dating many girls without marrying them, out of a desire for revenge (when I asked if he was taking revenge on his ex-wife or others, he did not answer! He said that after he became successful, his ex-wife had wanted to remarry him, but he refused! However, he now gets along well with his ex-wife as friends!). Two years ago, he met a woman from Sichuan in a foot massage parlor, who immediately caught his attention; at first, she only said she was divorced. The visitor initially felt sorry for this \"divorced\" woman, thinking it was dangerous for a woman to be in such an environment. Later, at his suggestion, the Sichuan woman left the foot massage parlor and moved in with him. After cohabiting, the visitor discovered that this Sichuan woman was not actually divorced and had a husband and children back in her hometown; her husband was just relatively docile and weak. Although he regretted it, this hardworking and caring Sichuan girl gave him a feeling of not being able to let go (he said he was getting older and wanted to find a home!). Later, they ran a fruit store together, but three months later, he subleased it because he couldn't manage multiple responsibilities and wanted to focus on his construction projects. Two months ago, spurred by a friend, he went to Macau to gamble, initially bringing 50,000 yuan. When he was down to just 5,000 yuan, he turned the tables, not only recovering his capital but also winning an additional 20,000 yuan. This easy way of making money was highly tempting for him, as he always wanted to get rich quickly. Consequently, he soon planned a second trip to Macau. Unfortunately, this time he lost all of his family's savings—300,000 yuan—and incurred a debt of 50,000 yuan. The failure of gambling brought him back to the poverty he experienced at the time of his divorce, which significantly impacted his self-esteem, leaving him feeling particularly inferior and quickly falling into a state of depression. The Sichuan girl stood by him, taking out 10,000 yuan from her savings to help pay off his gambling debts. To alleviate the visitor's burden, she wanted to return to the foot massage parlor because it was a quick way to earn money. This was unacceptable to the visitor (he felt it was okay for himself to enjoy the foot massage parlor but firmly believed that a woman who was good to him should not work in that industry, and he absolutely forbade it. The visitor has been anxious lately because his girlfriend has been wanting to return to her old job). As a result, they often quarreled. Due to the visitor's recent poor emotional state, he mostly complained and blamed the girlfriend during their arguments. Fearing his girlfriend would leave him, he exerted more control over her, which she found very off-putting. Sometimes, the visitor resorted to threatening language to warn her, which terrified her, and now his girlfriend has separated from him. Currently, his only concern is whether his girlfriend will return to the foot massage parlor (what does he fear about her returning to her old job? He worries that she will engage in sexual relations with others and does not allow other men to touch her; the visitor admits he has a strong desire for control because he fears she will leave him while she is there). For the past two months, he has been unable to sleep at night, filled with anxious thoughts, and his hair is almost falling out; he says he is afraid to get a haircut! (The visitor repeatedly mentioned his hair falling out and lifted his hair for me to see! I wonder what I could have said at that moment to help the visitor?)", "Later, the visitor mentioned several times his experience of fortune-telling last year. The fortune teller said he would suffer financial losses this year and advised against investing or engaging in large business ventures. He didn’t listen and, as expected, the fortune teller was right! (When the visitor brought up the fortune-telling for the second time, I felt curious about its significance to him.) I asked if the fortune teller said anything else. The fortune teller also mentioned that he would have a turn of fortune in two or three years, around the age of thirty-six or thirty-seven, when he would reach the peak of his career. He felt he couldn't wait and wanted to end his suffering through suicide! (In fact, our consultation had entered crisis intervention; the visitor was in great pain and was in a very dangerous state. He described often being in a semi-dazed state while driving on the highway and expressed a desire to end his life by crashing into a guardrail.) I then started discussing with him his thoughts on suicide, including the method, timing, and feelings associated with it. He said he had only a week left. I asked him if there were any people or things he cared about during the last seven days of his life. We later talked about his son. He mentioned his son’s disobedience (the visitor had repeatedly heard this topic; should it be explored further or intentionally downplayed?). He brought up that his son lost his mother at the age of three and that over the years, he had focused solely on making money, lacking love and companionship for his son, and once again, the visitor broke down in tears!", "V. Case Analysis: The client is currently facing multiple pressures, and in this situation, it is easy for a person to break down. However, the main source of pressure comes from the failure of gambling in Macau, which triggered the client's deep-seated feelings of inferiority. This inferiority has caused the client to become irritable and has led to financial stress, prompting the female partner to consider returning to her old profession, which the client cannot accept, thereby triggering a psychological crisis for the client. At the time when the client most needs psychological support, the girlfriend's departure has made the client's situation even worse. The client's mother has recently been diagnosed with cancer and is undergoing treatment (it is unknown whether this is related to the client's gambling failure), and she cannot take care of the client's child. Just as the client said, his troubles feel like a tangled mess, and he doesn't know where to start untangling them!", "Six. Reflection on the Success or Failure of the Consultation: The entire consultation lasted a full five hours, which is the longest session I have ever conducted. It can be described as a marathon-style consultation, or perhaps a long crisis intervention! Initially, we agreed on two hours, but that was completely insufficient. The client was experiencing severe depressive emotions and lost control multiple times, unable to break free from these feelings. At first, the client’s expectations were solely focused on his gambling failures and the departure of his girlfriend. However, as the session progressed, the client's focus began to shift, and he started to broaden his perspective and open up further. I then learned that his mother had recently been diagnosed with cancer and could no longer take care of the child, so he had to ask his ex-wife for help with childcare. He felt that his child was living in someone else's home, and he couldn't afford much in child support, which made him feel even more inferior. Eventually, the child learned about the grandmother's illness, which affected his academic performance, and the teachers had reached out to him multiple times as a parent! The progress of the consultation unfolded as our client-consultant relationship deepened. Teacher Haibo said that the duration of the consultation and the direction of the questions are determined by the client’s current situation; this insight was helpful and supportive for my session."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflection on the consultation process has provided a wealth of insights, both in terms of the clinical techniques employed and the personal growth experienced as a counselor during this challenging session. The complexity of this case demanded a nuanced understanding of the client's narrative, an understanding deepened by the use of Narrative Therapy as a guiding framework. In retrospect, several aspects of the consultation stand out as particularly instructive.\n\nFirstly, the consultation highlighted the necessity of tailoring the therapeutic approach to the client's unique circumstances and worldview. The client's frequent references to fortune-telling and his interpretations of personal misfortune underscored the importance of respecting and exploring the client's belief systems. This understanding opened a space for dialogue that was not only therapeutic but also culturally sensitive. It became clear that these beliefs were not mere superstitions but rather integral parts of the client's narrative identity, influencing his decisions and emotional states. By acknowledging and integrating these beliefs into our sessions, the consultation was able to connect more deeply with the client's lived experiences.\n\nThe client's perception of his son's disobedience and his own feelings of inadequacy as a father emerged as pivotal themes in the consultation. Initially, these themes were downplayed, perhaps out of a misplaced belief that focusing on the client's immediate crisis—his gambling losses and the departure of his girlfriend—was more urgent. However, as the consultation progressed, it became apparent that these familial issues were inextricably linked to the client's sense of self-worth and his depressive symptoms. The revelation that his son was a more significant reason to live than his romantic entanglements marked a turning point in the session. This realization was not just therapeutic but transformative, reshaping the client's priorities and providing a renewed sense of purpose.\n\nThe consultation also provided a profound lesson in the importance of maintaining professional neutrality. My initial struggle to remain unbiased regarding the client's girlfriend from Sichuan was a significant learning moment. This personal bias, though subtle, could have potentially skewed the therapeutic direction and hindered the client's exploration of his feelings and motivations. By consciously working to overcome this bias and genuinely accepting the client's perspective on his girlfriend, the therapeutic alliance was strengthened, and the consultation took a more constructive course. This experience underscored the need for self-awareness and continuous reflection as essential components of effective counseling practice.\n\nAnother critical insight was the client's perception of the psychologist's role. The visitor's assertion that he could become a counselor and do a better job was initially surprising. However, upon reflection, it became clear that this was a manifestation of his regained self-confidence and agency. His acknowledgment of personal agency in solving his problems was a positive outcome of the consultation, reflecting a shift from a passive victim of circumstances to an active participant in his own life. This realization reaffirmed the therapeutic goal of empowering clients to find their solutions and underscores the importance of facilitating rather than directing the client's journey.\n\nThroughout the consultation, the challenge of managing the session's duration was evident. The five-hour marathon session was both exhausting and illuminating. It taught the necessity of flexibility in therapeutic settings, especially during crisis interventions. While such extended sessions are not sustainable as a regular practice, they may be warranted in cases of acute distress where immediate stabilization is required. This experience emphasized the importance of setting clear expectations about time and fees, as well as maintaining open communication about the client's comfort and needs throughout the session.\n\nThe exploration of the client's social networks and available resources was another area that proved beneficial. Encouraging the client to leverage his existing connections to identify new business opportunities provided a practical focus amidst the emotional turmoil. This approach not only offered a potential pathway out of financial distress but also reinforced the client's sense of agency and competence. It highlighted the value of integrating solution-focused strategies within a narrative framework, aligning the client's story of personal resilience with actionable steps towards recovery.\n\nThe consultation's outcome, marked by a visible shift in the client's emotional state and a newfound sense of hope, was a testament to the power of therapeutic intervention. The client's message expressing gratitude and noting the positive impact of the session was a gratifying affirmation of the therapeutic process. It also served as a reminder of the profound responsibility inherent in the counselor's role to support individuals through their darkest moments.\n\nIn conclusion, this case reflection has deepened my understanding of the delicate balance between empathy, cultural sensitivity, and professional boundaries in psychotherapy. It has reinforced the importance of viewing clients as experts in their own lives and narratives, deserving of a collaborative and respectful therapeutic partnership. This experience has undoubtedly enriched my practice, providing valuable insights that will inform future consultations and contribute to the ongoing development of my professional identity as a counselor.", "causes": "Multiple factors such as low economic self-esteem after divorce, gambling failure, emotional conflict, and pressure of family responsibilities are intertwined", "symptoms": "Low mood, anxiety and insomnia, physical symptoms (e.g., hair loss), suicidal thoughts", "treatment_process": "Using narrative therapy to guide the visitor to reconstruct her self-narrative, focusing on the parts she can control, exploring suicidal thoughts, broadening the perspective of the problem, and integrating social resources.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Multiple stressors led to psychological breakdown, gambling failure became the trigger, emotional and financial pressure interacted with each other, and the psychological state continued to deteriorate.", "treatment_effect": "Visitor's emotional state changed significantly, regained hope for life, expressed gratitude for counseling, reflecting the positive impact of the treatment, and successfully intervened in the crisis."}

After graduating, she married a husband from the city with a good economic background and emphasized that this classmate treats her well and is kind to her parents, even washing their feet. Her father became disabled in a car accident when she was young, and the family has always been financially strained. Her parents feel particularly proud in the village that their daughter married a wealthy and respectable son-in-law from the city. (Later, I felt that her husband might be insecure due to issues with sexual performance, and he has a tendency to please her and her rural parents! More importantly, the visitor repeatedly mentioned during the interview that her family's financial situation is poor while her in-laws are well-off. Upon verification, it was found that her father-in-law earns around 100,000 to 200,000 yuan a year, while her husband has not worked in the two years since their marriage, and the 200,000 yuan debt from his company is being repaid by the visitor. This shows her inner lack of confidence.) The visitor said she has already cheated, having an affair with a former music lover from college. The reason for the infidelity is that for three years, her husband's sexual activity lasted only one minute each time and occurred only once every ten days to two weeks, and his hardness was insufficient. Initially, her husband attributed this to prostatitis, but later she learned that he had been watching adult films with his uncle since middle school and then masturbated excessively, which eventually led to erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation. At the beginning of their marriage, the visitor said she had no sexual experience and did not feel any discord in their sexual relationship. It was only after chatting with some married women that she learned about other couples' sexual situations and realized through comparison that her husband's sexual ability was abnormal: after each sexual encounter, her husband would complain about back pain, and in the early days of their marriage, they were more frequent, about once a week, but now it has decreased to once every half month or even a month, and each time lasts less than a minute with no feeling. Once, during a conversation, they jokingly said he allowed her to cheat, and now that she has really cheated, she doesn't know what to do. Can she endure this kind of life? After all, marriage is not easy, and divorce harms both families, but she is also somewhat afraid of this future life! After the infidelity, she feels very guilty and blames herself, thinking that the failure of the marriage is her fault.", "5. Personal Analysis: The visitor's feelings of inferiority are mainly due to the family environment and parenting style they experienced from a young age, which has led to a psychological sense of inferiority. This psychological inferiority is the primary factor contributing to the visitor's current difficulties."], "experience_and_reflection": "Upon further reflection on this case, I find it essential to delve deeper into the multifaceted layers of the client's experiences and the contextual factors influencing her current predicament. In the initial consultation, we focused significantly on the dilemma she faces between her husband and her lover. Yet, it's crucial to recognize that this external conflict is a manifestation of a more profound internal struggle rooted in self-perception and past experiences.\n\nThe client's sense of inferiority, as previously noted, is a significant driving force behind her current distress. This inferiority stems from her upbringing in a financially constrained rural environment, where societal and familial expectations have shaped her self-worth. Her marriage into a wealthier family only exacerbated these feelings, as she continuously compares herself to her in-laws and perceives herself as lacking. This sense of inadequacy is further compounded by her husband's sexual dysfunction, which she internalizes as a personal failure despite its roots in his history with pornography and masturbation.\n\nIn narrative therapy, we emphasize the power of personal narratives in shaping one's identity and behavior. The client's narrative is heavily influenced by her family's financial struggles and her father's accident, which left a lasting imprint on her psyche. This narrative paints a picture of a woman who has overcome significant hurdles to achieve a level of economic independence, yet she remains tethered to her past by a lingering sense of inadequacy. Her current annual income of 200,000 yuan, a testament to her resilience and entrepreneurial spirit, is overshadowed by this deep-seated belief in her insufficiency.\n\nIt's vital to explore the interplay between the client's internalized narrative of inadequacy and her marital and extramarital relationships. Her husband's inability to perform sexually could be perceived as a reflection of her own worth, a narrative she might have constructed to rationalize her feelings of inadequacy. This narrative is further reinforced by the societal and familial pressures to maintain a successful marriage, despite its evident flaws. Her affair with a former college boyfriend, then, becomes not just a quest for sexual satisfaction but also an attempt to reclaim a sense of worthiness and desirability that she feels is missing in her marriage.\n\nMoreover, the dynamics within her marital home reveal a complex web of power and control.

Therefore, the visitor came for consultation to resolve this issue. (The visitor has agreed to keep personal information confidential for public disclosure of the case.) Below is the entire consultation process presented. (Visitor: referred to as \"V,\" Consultant: referred to as \"C\")\n\nC: Hello, we are going to explore the situation where you always cry during parent-teacher meetings at school. If you are ready, please let me know.\n\nV: Okay, let me adjust myself.\n\nC: Alright, we can take a moment to adjust. \n\nV: I’m ready.\n\nC: Hmm, do you cry every time you see the teachers, or is it only in certain situations?\n\nV: Let me think... hmm, it’s when I’m called to school for a parent meeting, or when I feel that my child might be criticized by the teacher, that’s when I feel particularly nervous. I really dislike participating in such school activities and try to have my child’s father attend instead, but sometimes he really can’t, so I have no choice but to go.\n\nC: Yes, you really don’t want to participate in such parent meetings or be called to school by the teachers. But when you absolutely have to, you go anyway.\n\nV: Yes, I really don’t want to participate, but I have to.\n\nC: When you say you have to participate, you sighed. Let’s reflect on what that sigh might express if it could talk.\n\nV: You mentioned I sighed. That sigh expresses that I have no choice; I really don’t want to participate. But I have to. It’s very helpless. (At this point, the visitor starts to cry.)\n\nC: Yes, you really don’t want to participate, but there’s really no way out. What is it that makes you not want to participate in such activities?\n\nV: What makes me not want to participate? I’m especially afraid—especially afraid of the teachers. I just don’t want to be scolded by them.\n\nC: You are already an adult now. What happened in the past that makes you so unwilling to face the teachers, so afraid of them, and scared of being scolded? Let’s feel that fear. Really feeling scared, let’s see what comes to your mind that makes you so afraid of facing the teachers. Let’s close our eyes and feel it.\n\nV: Okay, I’ll close my eyes. I don’t know; I just don’t want to be scolded by the teachers.\n\nC: Yes, you really don’t want to be scolded by the teachers. What did the teachers say to you that made you so afraid?\n\nV: No, don’t bring it up. I’m scared of being scolded by the teachers; I don’t want to mention it.\n\nC: Yes, you really don’t want to mention it—especially the part about being scolded by the teachers.\n\nV: Yes, I just don’t want to mention it. Why are they so harsh? Why do they scold me so cruelly? Why, why, why? (At this point, the visitor has entered a deep emotional state.)\n\nC: What happened that made the teacher scold you so cruelly? You really don’t understand.\n\nV: Yes, I really don’t understand. There were about twelve or thirteen people in the dormitory; they were all chatting. I was outside hanging clothes after evening study. I didn’t have time to dry my clothes during the day, but I was the only one hanging clothes outside on the balcony, so the teacher caught me. The others were all talking, and the teachers couldn’t find anyone else. The next day, they called me to the podium and scolded me so cruelly, calling me shameless. The words they used were unbearable. That was not how a teacher should speak; it was insulting.\n\nC: Yes, so many people were talking, but because you were hanging clothes outside, the teacher scolded you and insulted you in front of everyone.\n\nV: Yes, those words were too harsh. I’m still a girl, and I bit my lip so hard that it bled, but I just had to endure it.\n\nC: Yes, you were enduring it even though you bit your lip until it bled.\n\nV: I really was hanging clothes outside, and he was the teacher, so I could only endure it.\n\nC: When you had to endure it, what feelings were inside you?\n\nV: I couldn’t resist; I could only endure it. (Saying this, the visitor lowered their head.)\n\nC: Now, let’s look at this situation from the perspective of an observer. You can see a teacher scolding a female student. That student was called to the podium and insulted just because she hung clothes outside the night before. What do you feel when you see this?\n\nV: Teacher, isn’t that person me?\n\nC: Yes, but we can try to be an observer and see this situation through your eyes. Can you try to visualize everything happening?\n\nV: Hmm, let me see. I see the teacher looking fierce, spewing insults at a girl. The girl has her head down, crying very sadly. I can see that.\n\nC: You see her crying so sadly. Do you want to help her?\n\nV: I feel very sorry for her. It’s just hanging clothes; why insult her like that?\n\nC: Yes, you really feel sorry and don’t understand why she is being insulted.\n\nV: Yes, it’s really infuriating. To humiliate a girl like that, such a teacher doesn’t deserve to be a teacher at all. Everyone in the school should know how poor this teacher’s morals are.\n\nC: Yes, this teacher’s morals are so poor; they really don’t deserve to be a teacher. What can we do about it?\n\nV: We can write a big poster and put it up at the school notice board.\n\nC: Let’s try to write this big poster. What should it say?\n\nV: XXX teacher does not deserve to be a teacher. Publicly insulting students in school causes serious psychological distress to students. This is hereby notified.\n\nC: Alright, let’s put this big poster up in the school so everyone knows. Can you see this big poster being put up on campus in your mind?\n\nV: I can see it; many people are watching.\n\nC: How do you feel at this moment?\n\nV: Watching those teachers and students reading this big poster, I feel relieved, and I’m very touched. Finally... (crying)\n\nC: Yes, finally everyone knows that this teacher insulted a student with malicious words.\n\nV: Yes, I finally understand it wasn’t my fault, and it feels particularly refreshing inside.\n\nC: Good, let’s really feel this feeling and record it in your heart.\n\nV: Hmm... that feeling of being proud and relieved, that feeling of finally being able to hold my head high.\n\nC: Very good, we clearly feel this sensation. Now, let’s see why the teacher was so fierce in scolding a girl, using such insulting language. Can we ask your teacher and see what kind of answer they might give you?\n\nV: I still don’t want to see him.\n\nC: We don’t have to see him.\n\nV: Hmm, he has serious burns on his face, and he is very afraid of being criticized by the school. It seems he feels that he is already ugly, and if his work is not good, it would be too embarrassing.\n\nC: Yes, he has burns on his face, so he is very afraid of others denying him.\n\nV: Yes, so he is very afraid of the students in his class being criticized by the school, which is why he is so strict with us.\n\nC: It seems he is just worried about not doing his job well.\n\nV: Yes, that’s why he has such a bad temper.\n\nC: Yes, he has such a bad temper because he has already been punished.\n\nV: Yes, he saw the big poster from the whole school and quietly lowered his head to leave.\n\nC: Good, looking at him quietly leaving with his head down, let’s reflect on how your child’s homeroom teacher called you to school to discuss your child. What do you feel?\n\nV: I no longer feel afraid. Perhaps if I don’t go, she might be afraid too. She doesn’t know why I’m so hard to approach.\n\nC: It seems you have already handled this relationship very well now.\n\nV: Yes, I can clearly distinguish now that my child’s homeroom teacher is not the teacher who scolded me.\n\nC: Alright, let’s keep this understanding, and when you’re ready, open your eyes. Let’s reflect on this experience.\n\nV: Okay.\n\nC: Let’s look around and bring our awareness back to the present. Then feel if you still worry or fear attending the parent meeting.\n\nV: (smiling) I’m not afraid anymore. Thank you, teacher."], "experience_and_reflection": "Consciousness, emotions, and the body all express our cognition. This complex interplay becomes particularly salient in the therapeutic setting, where the conscious mind, emotional responses, and somatic sensations intersect to reveal deeper truths about the individual’s psyche. In this case, we see how the visitor's anxiety about parent-teacher meetings stems from a traumatic experience deeply rooted in her subconscious. Despite her conscious understanding that her child's teachers are distinct from the teacher who traumatized her, the emotional and physical reactions she experiences indicate that her subconscious has yet to make this differentiation.\n\nThe therapeutic process revealed that addressing the subconscious layers of fear and trauma requires more than just conscious acknowledgment. This is where re-experience therapy proves invaluable. By allowing the visitor to re-engage with her past trauma in a controlled and supportive environment, we facilitated a process where her subconscious fears could be brought to light, examined, and ultimately transformed.\n\nOne of the key insights from this case is the importance of aligning the visitor’s conscious thoughts with their subconscious feelings. The visitor's initial reactions during parent-teacher meetings were driven by an automatic response pattern established during her traumatic experience with her teacher. Her body and emotions reacted as if she were still that young girl being publicly shamed and ridiculed. As a therapist, my role was to guide her through the process of re-experiencing that event, not to relive the trauma in its full painfulness, but to reframe it and view it from a new, empowered perspective.\n\nDuring the consultation, we navigated through a complex emotional landscape. The visitor's initial resistance to recalling the details of her past trauma was a significant barrier, highlighting the protective mechanisms her mind had erected to shield her from pain. However, by gently encouraging her to reflect on these emotions and approach them from an observer's standpoint, we allowed her to gain a new perspective. This observer stance enabled her to dissociate slightly from the traumatic event, reducing its emotional charge and permitting a more analytical approach to her feelings.\n\nThis therapeutic strategy underscores the necessity of creating a safe space for the visitor to explore their subconscious without the fear of judgment or retraumatization. By merely reflecting her words and emotions, I acted as a mirror, allowing her to confront her fears while feeling supported. This approach respects the visitor's autonomy and empowers them to draw their own conclusions, facilitating a deeper, more personal understanding of their emotions and reactions.\n\nA notable aspect of this process was the visitor's imaginative engagement with the scenario of writing a public poster condemning the teacher's actions. This imaginative exercise served multiple therapeutic purposes. It provided a symbolic act of justice and retribution, something she felt she was denied at the time of the original incident. This empowerment allowed her to reclaim agency over her narrative, transforming her from a passive victim to an active participant in her healing process.\n\nFurthermore, the exercise of visualizing the teacher’s reaction to the poster brought about an unexpected empathy for the teacher, who himself was dealing with personal insecurities. This moment of empathy was pivotal, as it helped dissolve the rigid, fearful image she had of authority figures, paving the way for a more nuanced understanding of her current interactions with teachers. By recognizing that her fear was more about the teacher’s own issues rather than a reflection of her worth, she could detach her self-esteem from the incident, allowing for healing.\n\nAnother crucial element of this case was the emphasis on the bodily experience of emotions. The visitor's somatic response to recalling the trauma—such as crying or feeling a sense of helplessness—was as informative as her verbal recollections. The physical manifestations of her trauma needed to be acknowledged and addressed as part of the healing process. By focusing on these bodily sensations, we could further integrate her emotional and cognitive understanding, fostering a holistic healing experience.\n\nThroughout this process, my role was to remain a neutral guide, resisting the urge to impose my interpretations or judgments on her narrative. This approach allowed the visitor to engage with her story on her terms, discovering her truths and insights. The absence of imposed values or opinions ensured that the insights gained were authentic and internalized, rather than borrowed from an external authority.\n\nReflecting on the entire therapeutic journey, it becomes evident that healing from trauma involves a delicate balance between revisiting past pain and fostering present empowerment. The visitor's journey was one of transformation, moving from a place of fear and avoidance to one of understanding and empowerment. By successfully distinguishing between past and present, she could reframe her interactions with her child's teachers, no longer seeing them as threats but as partners in her child's education.\n\nThis case reaffirms the power of therapeutic techniques that engage the subconscious. By allowing individuals to access and transform their deep-seated fears and beliefs, we can facilitate profound and lasting change. The therapeutic alliance, characterized by empathy, respect, and non-judgment, remains the cornerstone of this process, providing the safety and support necessary for individuals to explore and heal from their traumas. Through this journey, the visitor learned not only to face her fears but also to embrace a new narrative, one where she is no longer a victim of past circumstances but a resilient individual capable of facing the future with confidence and clarity.", "causes": "Traumatic experience of being humiliated by teachers in the past, which led to the patient's fear of teachers.", "symptoms": "Extreme nervousness, fear, and even crying when interacting with teachers.", "treatment_process": "Re-experiencing therapy was used to guide the patient to re-face and transform the trauma.", "characteristics_of_illness": "incongruity between conscious, emotional and physical responses, subconscious failure to distinguish between past traumatized teachers and present teachers.", "treatment_effect": "The patient's fear was eliminated, and she was able to attend parent-teacher conferences and interact with teachers normally."}
{"id": 170, "case_description": ["Mr. Shen has been experiencing anxiety, depression, acute panic attacks, a strong sense of impending death, fluctuating blood pressure, an inability to stand, and a fear of going out for the past year.", "The treatment process for this case was quite tumultuous. Initially, a lady found our Dr. Cao Hypnosis Center online while searching for hypnotherapy for anxiety disorders. She kept calling to inquire whether hypnotherapy could treat anxiety and fear, expressing great concern about the effectiveness of the treatment. I patiently explained repeatedly that we cannot guarantee results, but hypnotherapy is the fastest and most effective among all psychological treatments, and I would do my best. Clearly, this answer did not satisfy her, and she was still unable to decide on treatment. Thus, every few days, she would call again with the same inquiries. After nearly a month, she finally decided to seek treatment but requested that I come to her home, citing her inability to go out due to fear and obstacles, which could trigger panic attacks; she had even stopped going to work. For new and unfamiliar clients, I do not make home visits and require them to come to my clinic for treatment. Then, she went silent again. A few days later, a man called to inquire about hypnotherapy for fear symptoms. I noticed that his situation seemed very similar to that of the lady, so I asked if someone at home had consulted about this. He laughed and admitted that I had guessed correctly; it was his wife who was inquiring, and he wanted to schedule a consultation, but he needed to arrange it due to issues with traveling. Since we had communicated multiple times over the phone, I was quite familiar with his symptoms and advised him that if he wanted treatment, he should trust us and not waste time and money on further consultations; it would be better to come directly for treatment. He said he would think about it. Ultimately, that afternoon, he called to schedule treatment for the following day. Up to this point, he had not revealed his true identity, which made me feel that he was very concerned about his image."], "consultation_process": ["The next day, I met Mr. Shen as scheduled. He had the appearance of a cultured scholar, with a smile that was quite charming, not at all resembling the terrifying figure he had described. He was middle-aged, of average build, a master's student, and a project manager at a state-owned enterprise. The problem started a year ago: that day, while riding his bike to work, he suddenly felt discomfort in his chest, his heart raced, he felt his blood pressure rising, he became anxious, and was sweating profusely... He couldn't bring himself to continue to work and immediately returned home, took out a blood pressure monitor, and found that his blood pressure had risen significantly; he felt extremely tense. After a while, he measured it again, and it was still rising; he was filled with terror. An uncontrollable panic overtook him at that moment, and he couldn't help but measure it once more, only to find that his blood pressure was still rising... A feeling of impending death completely overwhelmed him, and he felt he would die at any moment! With the last bit of strength, he dialed 120 and then passed out... When he regained consciousness, he found himself lying in a hospital, alone, feeling helpless as he looked around at the elderly patients beside him. Thinking that he was only 40 years old, he felt he had fallen to such a low point (he even lost control of his bladder when anxious), and his state of mind was at its worst. The doctor responsibly tested all his physiological indicators, and except for hormones (which I personally suspect), everything was normal. The doctor told him it was a psychological issue: just an acute anxiety panic attack. He was discharged and went home. Thus, he began seeking treatment at well-known psychological clinics in Shanghai, such as the Jingwei Center and Huashan Hospital, but the results mainly focused on medication treatment. He took many types of medication along with psychological counseling, but the effects were minimal; whenever he heard sounds like honking horns on the street, he would panic and collapse to the ground, sweating profusely, with his blood pressure rising... He could no longer work and stayed at home to rest. Of course, he was unwilling to just let things go on like this, so he found his way to me.", "Since it is a psychological issue, hypnotherapy is bound to be very effective. I conducted a sensitivity test for him, and the results were below average, indicating he can be easily hypnotized. In my personal experience, anxiety is often related to suppressed life energy (sexual impotence), while panic is generally linked to improper suggestions to the subconscious. He also has depressive tendencies related to past failures in life. During the hypnotherapy sessions, we first addressed his sexual life, where the issues were prominent and obvious: his genitalia is relatively small, which clearly cannot satisfy his more dominant wife, leading to a loss of masculinity, increased tension and anxiety, and a sense of helplessness, all of which can have a devastating impact on a man's ability to cope with external pressures (subconscious feelings of impotence and helplessness). To please his wife, the sexual encounters often involve her using tools, and he is unable to satisfy her well, which is one of the reasons for his anxiety.", "Clearly, this reason is insufficient to explain all of the panic attacks. Next, I hypnotized him to address his emotional life, and during the hypnosis, I discovered that the person he loved most in his life was actually his first love, not his wife. He felt content and nostalgic about his original partner, believing they were a perfect match. He never told his girlfriend that he liked the songs of Dong Angge, yet she unexpectedly bought a tape of his music for him to listen to, showing a remarkable understanding. However, his mother seemed to disapprove of this girl. Later, through a series of misunderstandings, a woman (his current wife) pursued him while a man pursued her... They mistakenly broke up, leaving him filled with feelings of loss and helplessness (when \"love\" conflicts with \"filial piety,\" it often leads to mutual ruin, and parents should reflect more on this). This reason is also insufficient to explain all of the panic attacks.", "Continuing to delve into the impact of this failed relationship on his future life, it is evident that it dealt a fatal blow to him! Less than a year after the breakup, he experienced his first panic attack (about 10 years ago), with symptoms similar to those he has now. So what could the reason be? Personally, I believe it is not as simple as just breaking up with his ex-girlfriend. Therefore, I continued to conduct hypnosis and uncovered the most significant event in his life: in high school, he enjoyed literature classes (indicating he is primarily an emotional person), but his father forced him to choose science (which suits more rational individuals). Although he got into university, he never truly liked it and has never enjoyed his current profession (the influence of parents' values on a child's destiny is truly worth pondering)! It seems that throughout his life, he has suppressed doing what he does not like, leaving him feeling powerless, helpless, and resigned, unable to take responsibility for his own life. His subconscious began to seek an appropriate opportunity to erupt: leading to his panic attack! Could this be the whole reason? Can we call it a day? If that were the case, I wouldn’t publish this case; my intuition tells me that there seems to be something more complicated behind it.", "Then, by digging into his childhood memories, it was discovered that when he was 10 years old, his father also experienced a panic attack due to acute gastric illness, resulting in vomiting and diarrhea... This left a deep and terrifying imprint in his subconscious and he vividly remembered the entire process of the panic attack. It seems this was the true triggering factor. However, I still felt the reasoning was insufficient, because how can we explain the timing of his subconscious choice for the onset of the illness? By connecting all his issues and experiences, I suddenly understood the focus of the problem.", "I hypnotized him again back to the moment he fell ill ten years ago, clearly telling his subconscious not to avoid the essence of the problem and to reveal the truth to me! The subconscious is truly a master at creating and solving problems: it turned out that the real reason for his immense suffering, aside from being forced to break up with his girlfriend under his mother's pressure, was that a key member of the team working on the public relations project had left. The project challenges required him to be solely responsible for its completion, which exceeded his actual capabilities and psychological endurance. The overwhelming fear, helplessness, and frustration drowned him. How would he cope with his strong sense of pride? His subconscious wisely found a way out for him, leading to a panic attack that resulted in the loss of his job and responsibilities... thus concluding the act reasonably. Isn’t it beautiful? His subconscious successfully created all of this and retained the memory of it.", "In that case, uncovering the reasons for this illness became a straightforward task. Under my hypnotic suggestion, his subconscious willingly revealed the truth of the situation: the company had promoted him and assigned a major case to his team a year and a half ago, which was progressing smoothly. However, six months ago, when they were tackling the most challenging part, another key member of the team left the company to go abroad for personal reasons. He had to bear the brunt of the workload alone, which clearly exceeded his actual capabilities and psychological resilience. Additionally, his elderly mother, who had gone gray overnight ten years ago due to the need to care for his panic attacks, was now paralyzed in bed due to a cerebral infarction. He couldn’t face his sick mother and only paid someone to take care of her, having become accustomed to feeling helpless and unaccountable in the face of his responsibilities. She could no longer care for him, yet he still needed to worry about her. With both external and internal pressures, he felt he had no way out. Thus, his wise subconscious manufactured this panic attack once again, turning him into a patient who could not take responsibility for any situation but still required others to care for him."], "experience_and_reflection": "Upon reflecting further on the case of Mr. Shen, I am struck by the intricate tapestry of psychological, emotional, and subconscious elements that collectively influenced his experience of anxiety and panic. This case illustrates the profound complexity of human psychology, where conscious experiences are often just the tip of a much deeper subconscious iceberg. It is a testament to the intricate interplay between life events, personal history, and subconscious processes, which converge to manifest as psychological symptoms that can be both debilitating and enlightening.\n\nThe journey with Mr. Shen began with a series of seemingly insurmountable barriers. His initial hesitation and the circuitous route taken to reach my practice were reflective of the internal conflicts he was experiencing. The reluctance to engage directly was not merely a logistical challenge; it was symbolic of the fear and avoidance that had become central to his life. This avoidance, a common feature of anxiety disorders, was a defense mechanism his subconscious employed to shield him from perceived threats, whether they were external pressures or internal conflicts.\n\nAs I delved into his therapeutic process, it became apparent that Mr. Shen's anxiety was rooted not only in his present circumstances but also in unresolved issues from his past. The early life experiences, particularly the traumatic memory of his father's panic attack, had left an indelible mark on his psyche. This event had become a template for his own panic attacks, revealing how childhood experiences can lay dormant within the subconscious, waiting for the right conditions to resurface.\n\nThe therapeutic process with Mr. Shen was akin to peeling back layers of an onion. Each session revealed new insights, as we explored the significant events that shaped his psychological landscape. One of the pivotal revelations was the impact of his first romantic relationship, which he had idealized over the years. This relationship represented more than just a youthful romance; it embodied a time when he felt truly understood and valued. The loss of this relationship, coupled with familial pressure to conform to expectations, created a deep-seated sense of loss and unfulfilled potential.\n\nInterestingly, the hypnotherapy sessions highlighted how the subconscious mind can hold onto these emotional wounds, influencing behavior and perceptions long after the conscious mind has moved on. Mr. Shen's ongoing comparison between his past and present relationships revealed a subconscious yearning for the authenticity and connection he once felt. This yearning, left unaddressed, contributed to his anxiety, as it represented a gap between his current reality and the life he subconsciously desired.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Shen's professional life was another area where subconscious conflicts manifested. The forced choice of a career path by his father was not merely an isolated decision; it was a recurring theme of external control and suppressed autonomy. His lack of enthusiasm for his work was a daily reminder of the roads not taken, fostering a sense of disillusionment and stagnation. The subconscious rebellion against this imposed path manifested as panic attacks, which conveniently absolved him of the responsibilities he never truly embraced.\n\nThe role of Mr. Shen's familial relationships cannot be understated. His relationship with his wife, marked by unspoken dissatisfaction and unmet expectations, played a significant role in his psychological distress. The hypnotherapy sessions revealed that his feelings of inadequacy in his marriage were linked to broader themes of masculinity and self-worth. These feelings were exacerbated by his perception of his wife's dominance, which challenged his traditional views on gender roles and personal identity.\n\nInterestingly, Mr. Shen's subconscious also appeared to use his mother's expectations and his unresolved feelings about his first love as a lens through which to view his current marital dynamics. This triangulation of relationships, where past and present emotions intersected, created a complex web of emotional responses that fueled his anxiety and panic. The subconscious, in its attempt to reconcile these conflicting feelings, resorted to panic attacks as a means of temporary escape from this emotional turmoil.\n\nThroughout the therapeutic process, the concept of \"subconscious wisdom\" emerged as a central theme. The subconscious, while often perceived as a repository of unresolved conflicts, also possesses an intrinsic intelligence that seeks balance and resolution. Mr. Shen's panic attacks, although disruptive, served a protective function, allowing him to avoid situations that felt overwhelming and unmanageable. By bringing these subconscious processes into conscious awareness through hypnotherapy, we were able to reframe these protective mechanisms and transform them into more adaptive coping strategies.\n\nThe case of Mr. Shen also underscores the importance of addressing the psychosocial context in therapeutic interventions. His experiences were not isolated incidents but were deeply intertwined with broader societal and cultural expectations. The pressure to conform to traditional roles, both professionally and personally, created a tension between individual desires and societal norms. This tension was a significant contributor to his psychological distress, highlighting the need for therapeutic approaches that consider the individual within their cultural and social milieu.\n\nAs Mr. Shen progressed through treatment, there was a notable shift in his perception of himself and his circumstances. The process of uncovering and understanding the subconscious roots of his anxiety enabled him to reclaim agency over his life. He began to recognize the patterns of avoidance and fear that had governed his actions and was empowered to make conscious choices that aligned with his authentic self. This transformation was not instantaneous but was the result of sustained introspection and a willingness to confront uncomfortable truths.\n\nReflecting on this case, I am reminded of the resilience of the human spirit. Despite the layers of complexity and the weight of subconscious burdens, Mr. Shen demonstrated a remarkable capacity for growth and change. His journey was not merely about alleviating symptoms but was a profound exploration of self-discovery and empowerment. It serves as a testament to the potential of hypnotherapy and psychotherapy to facilitate deep and lasting change, by bridging the gap between the conscious and subconscious mind.\n\nIn sharing Mr. Shen's story, I am inspired by the intricacies of the human psyche and the potential for transformation that lies within each of us. This case reinforces the notion that understanding and healing are processes that require patience, empathy, and a holistic approach. It is a reminder that the journey of therapy is as much about unearthing hidden truths as it is about empowering individuals to write new narratives for their lives.\n\nAs I continue to reflect on this case, I am filled with a sense of gratitude for the privilege of accompanying individuals on their therapeutic journeys. Each case, like Mr. Shen's, offers unique insights and challenges, contributing to my growth as a clinician and deepening my appreciation for the complexity of the human experience. Through these experiences, I am continually reminded of the profound impact that understanding and compassion can have on the healing process, both for the client and the therapist.", "causes": "Traumatic memories of his father's panic attacks in childhood, forced breakup with his first love in adolescence, long-term repression of self, catering to his parents' choice of science, high work pressure and high expectations of his wife in adulthood.", "symptoms": "Anxiety Disorder", "treatment_process": "Mr. Shen received hypnotherapy after several consultations.

When the teacher asks her to play with classmates, she forces a smile at you but remains seated and unmoving. She usually locks herself in her room and does not play with classmates.

Case Analysis", "Everyone experiences feelings of inferiority and fear to varying degrees. Some students manage to navigate through the five years of elementary school smoothly, gaining certain strengths and advantages. However, when faced with fierce competition, they feel inadequate compared to others, which leads to a lack of competitive courage and self-confidence. As they enter the sixth grade, particularly when preparing for the graduation exam, they may feel anxious and unsettled. If they encounter setbacks along the way, their ability to cope psychologically diminishes further, making them feel even more incapable. In the midst of intense competition, this psychological barrier poses a significant threat to their success.", "1. Personal factors", "Through observation, I found that she has long been affected by negative influences such as low self-esteem, shyness, anxiety, and fear. The heavy psychological burden prevents her from accurately assessing her abilities, leading her to constantly doubt her strengths. Even in the face of success, she struggles to experience the joy of achievement, thus falling into a vicious cycle of failure. This severely impacts her physical and mental health development.", "2. Family factors", "Most families today are one-child families, which leads parents to have high expectations for their children, hoping for them to achieve great success. This results in many elementary school students bearing heavy burdens. When students fail to meet their parents' expectations, they develop feelings of inferiority, self-doubt, anxiety, distress, loneliness, and social withdrawal. Mothers often struggle to provide effective academic guidance, while fathers work late into the night and rarely inquire about their children's studies. Although they have high hopes for their children, their way of expressing these expectations is often very harsh.", "3. Teacher factors", "In schools, if teachers do not understand or pay enough attention to some students, it is easy to lead to a lower evaluation of these students. Once this happens, a few months or semesters later, these students gradually develop a sense of loss. They do not receive timely praise and admiration from teachers, which over time leads them to deny some of their behaviors and thoughts, slowly losing confidence in their abilities and levels, and becoming increasingly insecure. At this point, feelings of inferiority begin to take over. Additionally, the teachers' growing favoritism towards a few perceived top students creates a heavy pressure for the majority of students who are in the middle, fostering a serious sense of inferiority. Moreover, the teachers' one-sided understanding of students and their tendency to favor top students further deepens the psychological pressure on elementary school students, exacerbating their feelings of inferiority.", "Years of experience as a homeroom teacher tell me that the situation of student Wang is likely due to some psychological issues. How can we help her overcome her inferiority complex and emerge from this shadow?", "3. Counseling Strategies", "During this half semester, I conducted a management practice in the class with the theme \"The class is my home, and management relies on everyone.\" After some time of effort, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the situation of student Wang has improved significantly. Influenced by various class activities, she has gradually eliminated her inferiority complex and truly established a positive mindset of \"I can do it.\" Now, not only does she enjoy playing games with her classmates, but she also actively participates in class management and grade management. Seeing the changes in her is truly a rewarding experience.", "1. Motivational education, awakening confidence.", "\"Teacher's love is the foundation of education.\" In order to alleviate Wang's fear, I often engaged her in casual conversations during breaks, helped her tuck in her blanket during her midday nap at school, asked her to help me with assignments, and never publicly criticized her in class. When I noticed her progress, I would praise her promptly, often saying to the class, \"Look, our Wang is sitting so properly today!\" \"Our Wang answers questions so loudly!\" \"Our...\" With this intentional and unintentional tone, the whole class saw themselves as a unit, and Wang was a part of that unit. Gradually, Wang began to enjoy being close to me. Once, she innocently asked, \"Teacher, are you really a teacher?\" \"Don't I look like a teacher?\" I retorted. \"Not really, you always smile in class, teachers don’t smile during class!\" I happily took her hand and said, \"Good child, that's because you don't know that there are many teachers who love to smile in class!\"", "Build confidence and inspire motivation.", "I remember once when our class held a speech competition between groups, and shy Wang was chosen by her group. I knew this was an opportunity given to her by her group members, so I encouraged her good friends to rally around her and go up together. At first, she was reluctant, but after encouragement from her parents and teachers, she went up. And she performed quite well. I and other teachers praised her as a model in our respective classes. For the first time, she had a happy smile in front of her classmates. Since then, she has changed a lot and seems to have developed an interest in many subjects. After continuous encouragement and reinforcement, she made progress. One day, she asked me, \"Can I do it?\" I said, \"You are so amazing, of course you can. If you can speak so well in your speech, what else can't you do?\" She nodded excitedly. From then on, she really worked very hard, and her grades made a leap.", "Value family and improve capabilities.", "Wang's psychological inferiority largely stems from the educational environment and methods of her family. Therefore, I invited her parents to discuss and analyze Wang's performance at school and the reasons behind it. We communicated and provided feedback, and together we explored solutions to address the child's poor psychological condition, suggesting that the parents choose appropriate educational methods. We need to provide opportunities for the self-doubting student to express herself. For example, at home: when guests come over, parents can have her serve tea, unwrap candies, or play with the guests for a while, allowing her to perform a show for everyone. At the same time, appropriately assigning household chores to the child can improve her self-care abilities and help her develop communication skills with family members. It's important to acknowledge and praise the child's progress.", "4. Conduct evaluations to promote confidence.", "Carry out various evaluation activities to encourage her to play to her strengths and avoid weaknesses. We allowed her to establish her own growth record, evaluating her once a month. Through self-assessment and group assessment, she recorded her progress. In the evaluations, Wang received satisfaction and gained confidence from others' recognition; through self-criticism, she learned to reflect and gradually improve herself. To stimulate her self-education awareness, we provided her with accurate evaluations every month and collectively praised Wang's outstanding personal achievements during class meetings and parent meetings. This fully motivated her, enabling her to self-motivate in evaluations, unleash personal strength, and continuously practice self-discipline, confidence, and self-improvement.", "5. Participate in management, be confident and self-reliant.", "Through the in-depth management of independent projects, we have provided students with more autonomy. In the class, we advocate for a \"class leader rotation system\" and a \"group leader responsibility system.\" At the grade level, we have introduced various management positions to allow students to exercise full autonomy, continuously fostering self-discipline, self-confidence, and self-improvement. After some encouragement, Wang became actively involved in various independent management tasks. Starting as a group leader, she experienced a significant change in her perspective towards herself, her classmates, and tasks. She no longer wallowed in self-doubt; instead, she showcased confidence and resilience. In management, Wang identified some issues and, through communication with teachers and collaboration with classmates, her group not only met all evaluation standards but also ranked among the top in the class. Seeing her achievements brought a smile to Wang's face, and from that point on, she became more disciplined, more positive in her attitude, and more confident in her studies.", "6. Tutoring Effectiveness", "Through tutoring and gradually caring for and helping her, she has made significant changes. Wang's academic performance has continually improved, ranking sixth in her class in the school's mock exams. She actively interacts and plays games with classmates after class, and she raises her hand to speak up in class with a loud voice. Parents also report that she is proactive in studying at home, enjoys sharing class activities with them, and takes the initiative to help with household chores."], "experience_and_reflection": "The experience with Wang has been a profound journey, leading to several revelations about the dynamics of inferiority and the multifaceted approach needed to address it effectively. My initial engagement with Wang was rooted in the understanding that feelings of inferiority often stem from a complex interplay of personal, familial, and environmental factors. Each aspect of her life contributed to the development of her insecurities, and it was clear that a holistic approach was necessary to foster positive change.\n\nOne of the key insights gained from working with Wang is the importance of recognizing the subtle nuances of self-esteem issues among primary school students. The journey to overcoming inferiority is not merely about boosting confidence through external validation but involves nurturing an intrinsic sense of self-worth. Wang's transformation highlights the significance of cultivating an internal dialogue that encourages self-acceptance and resilience. By focusing on her strengths rather than shortcomings, we were able to create a supportive environment where she could thrive.\n\nReflecting on Wang's case has deepened my understanding of the role that familial expectations play in shaping a child's self-image. Wang's family, like many others, harbored high expectations which inadvertently placed a heavy burden on her young shoulders. This pressure often manifests as anxiety and withdrawal, leading to a cycle of self-doubt. Through collaborative discussions with her parents, we were able to identify the need for a balanced approach to expectations—encouraging ambition while allowing room for mistakes and growth. This shift in perspective was instrumental in alleviating some of the psychological pressure Wang experienced.\n\nMoreover, the influence of educational environments cannot be underestimated. Wang's experience underscores the critical role that teachers play in either perpetuating or alleviating feelings of inferiority among students. The favoritism shown towards academically proficient students can inadvertently marginalize those who are perceived as average, fostering a sense of inadequacy. As educators, it is imperative to be mindful of our interactions and to strive for inclusivity, ensuring that all students feel valued and supported. By actively engaging with Wang and providing her with opportunities to shine, we were able to counteract some of the negative perceptions she had developed about her abilities.\n\nIn hindsight, the strategies implemented in Wang's case were crucial in fostering her personal growth. Motivational education proved to be a cornerstone in awakening her confidence. The simple act of praising her publicly, acknowledging her efforts, and integrating her into class activities served as powerful motivators. These actions not only bolstered her self-esteem but also helped her forge stronger connections with her peers. The collective encouragement from classmates, teachers, and family played a pivotal role in shifting her mindset from one of inferiority to empowerment.\n\nFurthermore, Wang's involvement in management and leadership roles within the classroom significantly impacted her sense of self-reliance. By entrusting her with responsibilities, we provided her with opportunities to develop autonomy and decision-making skills. This empowerment was crucial in helping her perceive herself as competent and capable, fostering a sense of agency that extended beyond academic achievements.\n\nThe effectiveness of these interventions is evident in the dramatic improvement in Wang's academic performance and social interactions. Her progress serves as a testament to the power of comprehensive, empathetic engagement. It highlights the importance of creating a nurturing environment where students are encouraged to explore their potential, supported in their endeavors, and celebrated for their achievements.\n\nReflecting on Wang's success has reinforced the importance of patience and persistence in guiding students through their struggles with inferiority. The journey is not linear; it requires a delicate balance of encouragement, challenge, and support. Teachers must adopt a lens of understanding, focusing not only on correcting negative behaviors but also on recognizing and amplifying the unique strengths each student possesses. This approach fosters a sense of belonging and integration, gradually dissolving barriers and facilitating acceptance of guidance from educators.\n\nAdditionally, Wang's case has illuminated the need for continual self-reflection as an educator. It has encouraged me to reassess my teaching methods and interactions, striving for a more inclusive and supportive classroom environment. The realization that each student has a unique narrative and set of challenges has emphasized the importance of individualized attention and tailored interventions.\n\nUltimately, Wang's journey has reaffirmed the transformative power of empathy, encouragement, and community support in overcoming feelings of inferiority. It underscores the necessity for a collaborative approach involving parents, teachers, and peers to create a holistic support system that nurtures each child's potential. As educators, it is our responsibility to cultivate spaces where students feel safe, valued, and empowered to express themselves, paving the way for confident and resilient individuals.\n\nThe experience has left an indelible mark on my professional practice, guiding future engagements with similar cases. It serves as a reminder that while inferiority may be deeply ingrained, it is not insurmountable. With dedication, empathy, and a comprehensive strategy, students like Wang can emerge from the shadows of self-doubt, embracing their capabilities and achieving success both academically and personally.", "causes": "High expectations from his family, inappropriate parenting style, insufficient attention from school teachers, favoritism towards outstanding students, etc. led to a heavy psychological burden, inability to accurately assess his own abilities, and a vicious cycle.", "symptoms": "Low self-esteem, shyness, anxiety, fear, a strong sense of inferiority, and social withdrawal behavior.", "treatment_process": "classroom management practice, motivational education to awaken self-confidence, encouragement to participate in classroom activities, communication with parents to discuss solutions to psychological problems, assessment to promote self-confidence, participation in management, etc.", "characteristics_of_illness": "she did not raise her hand in class, answered questions in a low voice, her cheeks were red, she sat quietly in her seat after class and did not play with her classmates, and she refused to go out on holidays.", "treatment_effect": "Improvement in academic performance, raising hands and speaking in class, loud voice, interacting with classmates after class, taking the initiative to take care of household chores."}

Just like you told me before, if I ask myself more about what I really want, I won't act against it.", "Woman: I understand now, thank you, Teacher Tian. (Wiping her still-damp tears, she smiled.)"], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on this case, it's clear that underlying tensions and misunderstandings in relationships can often mask the true desires of the individuals involved. In this scenario, the couple's immediate reactions were defensive and accusatory, typical of many couples experiencing emotional turmoil. However, as a therapist, my primary role was not to serve as a judge but as a facilitator of communication and understanding. This approach is rooted in the principles of Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), which emphasizes the importance of language and behavior in shaping our experiences and interactions.\n\nOne of the key insights from this case is the power of simplifying complex emotions into clear, singular desires. When individuals can articulate their needs in a straightforward manner, it often becomes easier to address the underlying issues. This is because clarity reduces the noise created by emotional upheaval, allowing both parties to focus on constructive solutions rather than getting caught up in a cycle of blame and defensiveness. In this session, guiding each partner to express their fundamental desire—to live well together—provided a foundation for constructive dialogue. This is a crucial step in moving from conflict to resolution.\n\nFurthermore, this case highlights the necessity of establishing a safe space for each party to express their emotions without fear of judgment. By doing so, individuals are more likely to lower their defenses and engage in meaningful conversation. The woman in this case, overwhelmed by suspicion and hurt, initially struggled to see beyond her emotions. Similarly, the man's defensive posture was a barrier to open communication. Through the process of asking direct questions and prompting them to reflect on their actions and intentions, a path to mutual understanding was gradually forged.\n\nAnother critical element in the process was the use of humor and light-heartedness, which can be a powerful tool in therapy. It helped to defuse tension and allowed the couple to see the situation from a different perspective. This aligns with NLP's concept of re-framing, where changing the context or meaning of a situation can alter one's perception of it. By laughing at the absurdity of their argument, both parties were able to step back and reassess their priorities, shifting from confrontation to collaboration.\n\nIt's also important to acknowledge the role of cultural and societal expectations in shaping relationship dynamics. In many cultures, there are ingrained beliefs about gender roles and responsibilities within a marriage, which can influence how conflicts are perceived and handled. In this case, the man's initial reluctance to admit any wrongdoing and the woman's immediate jump to conclusions might reflect societal norms about masculinity and fidelity. Addressing these underlying assumptions is crucial for fostering genuine understanding and change.\n\nMoreover, this experience underscores the importance of active listening and empathy in resolving conflicts. By encouraging each partner to listen to the other’s perspective and acknowledge their feelings, they began to bridge the emotional gap between them. This aligns with the NLP technique of mirroring, where individuals match the other’s tone and body language to build rapport and trust. The couple's ability to eventually express regret and a desire to improve signifies a breakthrough in communication, facilitated by their willingness to listen and empathize.\n\nIn addition, the concept of \"respecting boundaries and not controlling\" is vital in any therapeutic process. It emphasizes the need for individuals to take responsibility for their actions and decisions. As therapists, we can guide and support, but ultimately, it is up to the individuals to enact change in their lives. This principle was evident when both partners recognized their role in the conflict and expressed a commitment to change. It is a reminder that personal growth and relationship improvement require active participation and a willingness to evolve.\n\nThis case also illustrates the challenges of working with couples who are entrenched in patterns of behavior that are counterproductive. Often, these patterns are so ingrained that breaking them requires significant effort and persistence. The iterative process of questioning and reflection used in this session is essential for unraveling these patterns. It encourages individuals to continuously reassess their behavior and its impact on their partner, promoting ongoing self-awareness and growth.\n\nIn conclusion, this case serves as a poignant reminder of the complexities inherent in marital conflicts and the transformative potential of effective communication. By leveraging NLP techniques and fostering an environment of empathy and understanding, couples can navigate their differences and strengthen their relationship. The journey from suspicion to trust is not straightforward, but with guidance and commitment, it is achievable. This reflection not only reinforces the core principles of therapeutic practice but also provides valuable insights for future sessions, emphasizing the need for patience, persistence, and compassion in helping couples achieve harmony.", "causes": "Poor communication between husband and wife, suspicion and misunderstanding of each other's behaviors, causing conflicts to accumulate gradually.", "symptoms": "husband and wife arguing, blaming each other, emotional and tense relationship.", "treatment_process": "using NLP therapy, by guiding the expression of needs, reflecting on behavior, role reversal, creating a safe space and the use of humor, etc., to promote communication and understanding between the two sides.", "characteristics_of_illness": "the conflict surface for behavioral conflicts, in fact, the inner needs are not met and the emotional connection is broken.", "treatment_effect": "The couple's relationship is eased, both parties express remorse and willingness to improve, and initial reconciliation is realized."}
{"id": 173, "case_description": ["Female, 32 years old, tense marital relationship."], "consultation_process": ["My husband cheated, and I am on the verge of a breakdown. I used to be on guard against him because his father cheated when he was a child, which led me to distrust men. By addressing issues related to values, thinking patterns, and interpersonal relationships, our marriage was ultimately repaired, and I experienced personal growth."], "experience_and_reflection": "There is a widely circulated joke: \"The two hardest things in the world are putting your own thoughts into someone else's head and putting someone else's money into your own pocket. Monks have managed to do it, and fortune tellers have done it too.\" This joke tells us that changing people's thoughts is very difficult, and getting them to willingly part with their money is also challenging. The work of a psychological counselor actually involves doing both of these things at the same time.\n\nReflecting on my years of practice, I've come to appreciate the profound complexity of the human mind and relationships. The case of a 32-year-old woman with a tense marital relationship offers a rich context for examining the intricate web of values, thought patterns, and interpersonal relationships. These elements are not just theoretical constructs but are deeply interwoven into the fabric of our personal experiences and societal interactions. Understanding and navigating these aspects are crucial for fostering healing and growth.\n\nLong-term study and practice of psychological counseling have made me realize that in order to provide quick and effective help to clients, one must focus on three aspects: values, thought patterns, and interpersonal relationships. These are not isolated domains but are deeply interconnected, influencing each other in a dynamic interplay that can either perpetuate dysfunction or facilitate healing.\n\n1. Values\n\nWhat are values? Values are the cognitions, understandings, judgments, or choices made based on certain sensory perceptions of a person. They represent a way of thinking or orientation through which individuals identify matters and discern right from wrong, thus reflecting the certain value or function of people, events, and things. In a class society, different classes have different value concepts. Values have characteristics of stability and durability, historicity and selectivity, and subjectivity. Values play a guiding role in motivation, while also reflecting people's cognition and needs.\n\nThe definition is somewhat abstract; in simple terms, it refers to what a person believes is right or wrong, what is good or bad, what they consider important or unimportant. This becomes particularly evident in the context of marital relationships, where conflicting values can lead to tension and discord. In the case at hand, the client's distrust of men, rooted in childhood experiences, had shaped her values regarding fidelity and trust. These values, while protective, also acted as barriers to intimacy and understanding with her husband.\n\nWhy should values be placed first? There is a famous judgment phrase: thoughts determine actions, actions determine results, and results determine fate. The core of thoughts is a person's values. If a person believes that their fate is mainly in their own hands, they will choose to take responsibility for themselves and strive; if a person believes that fate is controlled by others and unpredictable forces, they will choose to be passive and lazy, resigning to fate or blaming others. This perspective was crucial for my client, who initially saw herself as a victim of circumstances beyond her control. Through therapy, we worked to shift her values from a deterministic view to one where she recognized her agency and capacity for change.\n\nValues play a very important role in guiding and regulating people's behavior. Values determine a person's self-awareness, and they directly influence and determine the nature of a person's ideals, beliefs, life goals, and pursuits. The role of values can be roughly reflected in the following two aspects:\n\n1. Values have a guiding role on motivation. The motivations for people's behavior are influenced and constrained by values. Values have a significant impact on motivational patterns. Under the same objective conditions, people with different values have different motivational patterns, leading to different behaviors. The direction of motivation is governed by values, and only those that are deemed desirable through value judgment can be transformed into motivations for behavior, guiding people's actions towards those goals. For my client, recognizing that her marriage could be a source of growth rather than fear was a pivotal moment. This new value allowed her to approach her relationship with a renewed sense of purpose and motivation to rebuild trust.\n\nValues reflect people's cognitive and needs status. Values are people's evaluations and views on the objective world and the results of behaviors, thus, they reflect, in some aspects, people's outlook on life and worldview, as well as their subjective cognitive world. In therapy, addressing the client's values involved exploring how her past experiences had shaped her worldview and how these could be re-evaluated in light of her current reality. This re-evaluation process was not about discarding her past but integrating it in a way that empowered her present.\n\nThe formation of values is a long process with a complex background, so can they change? The answer is certainly yes, but it is not something that can be accomplished overnight. This was evident in our sessions, where gradual shifts in the client's perception were celebrated as significant milestones. Change in values requires a safe therapeutic environment where clients feel supported in exploring new perspectives.\n\n2. Thinking Patterns\n\nOne important difference between humans and animals is that humans have thinking abilities, while psychological issues in humans arise from problems in their thought processes. A dog cannot suffer from mental illness, nor can it undergo psychological counseling. This distinction highlights the complexity of human cognition and the potential for cognitive distortions to impact mental health.\n\nThe thinking patterns mentioned here are defined by me from a cognitive perspective and are my original theory. They are mainly divided into three types: unidimensional thinking, bidimensional thinking, and multidimensional thinking. In my practice, many visitors with strong analytical skills believe that this theory plays a significant role in analyzing and solving their own problems. My client, for instance, initially exhibited unidimensional thinking, viewing her husband's infidelity as a binary issue of betrayal and loyalty. This limited perspective hindered her ability to process the situation fully and consider alternative outcomes.\n\nBinary thinking means that one is one, two is two, either right or wrong, either black or white, only one situation, one judgment, one method, one reason, and so on. For example, killing is always wrong, thieves are always criminals, children must listen to parents and teachers, and women must be loyal to one partner. This rigid thinking pattern often leads to conflict and misunderstandings, as it does not allow for the complexity inherent in human behavior and relationships.\n\nBinary thinking is similar to dialectical thinking, where the same object or matter often has both positive and negative aspects, right and wrong can coexist, and advantages and disadvantages can be intertwined. For example, as an ordinary citizen, lacking power and status may not be enviable, but it also comes with significantly less pressure and crisis; a child who is extroverted and has a lively and generous side may also have a restless and inattentive side, and so on. For my client, learning to embrace this duality allowed her to see her husband's actions as part of a larger narrative, one that included both pain and potential for growth.\n\nDiverse thinking is the ability to view a problem from three or more perspectives. For example, between black and white, there is gray; similarly, black can be divided into hundreds of shades. One result may have many causes, and a difficult problem may have various solutions. For instance, what to do if a spouse cheats? A diverse thinking model may generate many coping strategies, rather than just choosing divorce or even murder. This approach was transformative for my client, who began to explore multiple pathways forward, each with its own set of possibilities and challenges.\n\nUsing the same question to compare three thinking modes makes it easier to understand. For example, what is the reason a child steals money? One-dimensional thinking would conclude that the child has become bad; two-dimensional thinking would argue that the child has become bad and the parents also have issues; while multi-dimensional thinking would consider that, in addition to problems with the child and the parents, the social environment in which the child is situated may also have issues, along with potentially other problems. This example illustrates the depth and breadth of analysis that multidimensional thinking allows, providing a more comprehensive understanding of complex issues.\n\nIn general, monistic thinking is emotional thinking, which is relatively simple, naive, and even biased; dualistic thinking lies between emotional and rational thinking and is the thinking pattern of most adults; pluralistic thinking is highly rational, also known as divergent thinking, and is a powerful tool for analyzing and solving problems. It is the most mature thinking pattern, but few people can skillfully use this mode of thinking. Encouraging clients to develop this skill can significantly enhance their problem-solving capabilities and emotional resilience.\n\nSu Shi's status as the greatest writer and thinker of the Song dynasty is closely related to his line, \"From the front it looks like a ridge, from the side it looks like a peak; from different distances and angles, it appears differently.\" This poetic imagery underscores the importance of perspective in understanding the complexities of life, a concept that is vital in therapy.\n\nFacts indicate that serious psychological issues such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, phobias, and paranoid personality disorder are closely related to dichotomous thinking. Recognizing and addressing these thought patterns is essential in therapeutic settings, as they can perpetuate distress and hinder recovery.\n\nThe three common irrational beliefs summarized by the famous founder of Rational Emotive Therapy, American psychologist Albert Ellis—\"absolute demands,\" \"overgeneralization,\" and \"catastrophizing\"—are all results of problematic thinking patterns. In therapy, helping clients identify and challenge these beliefs is a critical step towards cognitive restructuring and emotional well-being.\n\n3. Interpersonal Relationships\n\nThe psychological relationships formed between people during their interactions include kinship, friendships, relationships with classmates, teacher-student relationships, employer-employee relationships, comrade relationships, as well as relationships between colleagues and between leaders and subordinates. These relationships are fundamental to our sense of identity and belonging, influencing our mental health and quality of life.\n\nChinese people know that interpersonal relationships are important, as there is a saying that \"China is a society of relationships,\" but very few Chinese people take the time to carefully explore and cultivate their communication skills. This observation highlights a universal challenge: while we recognize the value of relationships, we often lack the tools and skills to nurture them effectively.\n\nSocial psychology research indicates that the fundamental purpose of life is to pursue happiness and joy. Do you know what the most important factor influencing happiness and joy is? The answer is surprising to many Chinese people—interpersonal relationships are the most significant factor affecting happiness and joy! Important interpersonal relationships, such as those between spouses, parents and children, colleagues, and friends, are issues we face every day. Modern success studies have found that networking is key to an individual's career success or failure. This underscores the importance of relational skills in both personal and professional domains.\n\nIf the first point is the root of psychological issues, and the second point is the pathway to psychological issues, then the third point is the symptoms of psychological issues. In therapy, exploring interpersonal relationships provides insight into the client's social dynamics and potential areas of conflict or support.\n\nHumans are social beings, and society is made up of people. To thrive in society, one must have good interpersonal relationships. Good interpersonal relationships form a solid social support system for a person, providing strong assistance during times of setbacks and injuries. At the same time, helping others allows individuals to feel their own value and enhances their self-confidence. For my client, rebuilding her relationship with her husband involved not only addressing past hurts but also cultivating a supportive and nurturing partnership.\n\nHowever, most people learn how to interact with others subtly, with their parents in the original family often being the first role models. If these parents have good personalities and interpersonal relationships, the children are usually fortunate; if the opposite is true, the children may learn many negative social psychology and communication behaviors, laying landmines for their future social lives and family building. Therefore, we all need to examine our interpersonal relationships after becoming adults and learn reasonable or better communication skills, thereby establishing good relationships as a solid foundation for our happiness and well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, the journey of therapy is one of exploration, reflection, and transformation. By focusing on values, thinking patterns, and interpersonal relationships, we can help clients navigate their challenges and discover pathways to healing and growth.

I will definitely change. Thank you, teacher."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on this case, it's evident that the use of narrative therapy was instrumental in helping the visitor navigate her complex web of thoughts and emotions. Initially, the decision to communicate via QQ text was influenced by the perception that her issues were relatively straightforward. However, as the dialogue unfolded, it became apparent that her concerns were deeply rooted in her interpersonal relationships and self-perception, requiring a nuanced approach.\n\nThe visitor's cognitive function is indeed well-developed; she demonstrates a keen awareness of her thoughts and behaviors. Despite this, her self-analysis reveals a profound insecurity and emotional fragility, characterized by obsessive-compulsive tendencies and a pervasive fear of judgment. These aspects, while recognized by her, present a significant barrier to her ability to establish harmonious relationships with colleagues and a positive self-image.\n\nThe metaphor of the flower, employed during our conversation, served as a pivotal tool in allowing the visitor to externalize her fears and anxieties. It facilitated a shift from self-critical introspection to a more compassionate understanding of her predicament. By imagining how a flower—a symbol of innocence and purity—might perceive her struggles, the visitor was able to detach from her internalized shame and consider a broader perspective on her thoughts and behaviors.\n\nOne core insight from this case is the power of metaphor in psychotherapy, particularly for individuals grappling with issues of self-esteem and fear of social judgment. The flower analogy enabled the visitor to voice her fears without the burden of immediate self-condemnation, offering a safe space to explore her emotions. This approach underscores the importance of creating therapeutic environments that prioritize empathy and acceptance, allowing clients to confront their vulnerabilities without fear of ridicule.\n\nClinically, the visitor's narrative reveals a significant conflict between her desires and societal expectations. Her fear of being perceived as engaging in behaviors she finds embarrassing speaks to a broader cultural discourse on sexuality and propriety. This internal conflict is exacerbated by her conservative upbringing, which discourages open discussion of sexual topics, leading to a dichotomy between her private fantasies and public persona.\n\nFurther analysis suggests that the visitor's suspicions about being watched or judged may stem from a hyper-vigilant state, often associated with anxiety disorders. Her living conditions—characterized by a lack of privacy and security—likely amplify these fears, contributing to her sense of isolation and vulnerability. This environmental factor highlights the need for clinicians to consider the broader context in which clients' issues manifest, including their physical and social environments.\n\nThe narrative also points to the visitor's struggles with social integration at her workplace. Her perception of colleagues discussing taboo topics and her discomfort with these conversations indicate a disconnect between her values and those of her peers. This dissonance is a critical component of her interpersonal difficulties, suggesting that her feelings of isolation are compounded by her inability to reconcile these differences.\n\nAddressing these issues requires a multifaceted approach. Encouraging the visitor to cultivate a sense of self-acceptance is paramount, as is fostering a willingness to engage with her colleagues from a place of understanding rather than judgment. Building interpersonal relationships based on mutual respect and empathy could alleviate her sense of alienation and enhance her social support network.\n\nAdditionally, helping the visitor develop coping strategies for managing intrusive thoughts and anxiety is essential. Techniques such as mindfulness and cognitive restructuring could empower her to challenge negative thought patterns and reduce compulsive behaviors. This therapeutic process should emphasize the normalization of her experiences, reinforcing that her thoughts and desires are a natural part of human development.\n\nReflecting on the consultation, it becomes clear that the visitor's journey towards self-acceptance and improved interpersonal relationships is ongoing. While she demonstrates a willingness to change, support from a therapist, as well as a supportive social environment, will be crucial in facilitating this transformation. The flower metaphor, and the insights gleaned from it, provide a foundation upon which she can build a more cohesive sense of self and a healthier interaction with her social world.\n\nIn conclusion, this case illustrates the intricate interplay between personal insecurities, societal expectations, and interpersonal dynamics. It highlights the importance of adopting a holistic approach in psychotherapy, one that considers the individual's cognitive, emotional, and environmental contexts. Through narrative therapy and metaphorical exploration, the visitor has begun to unravel the complexities of her experiences, paving the way for healing and growth.

{"id": 175, "case_description": ["The visitor is a 36-year-old female elementary school teacher who has not been happy in recent years and seeks help to better understand and adjust herself. She knows that it is understandable for students to make mistakes, yet she still intentionally scolds them, and she does not say anything when her own son makes mistakes. She is overly concerned about her child's safety and feels like a bad person. She has done things she shouldn't have and hasn't done things she should have. On one hand, she cannot control her urge to scold students, and feels a sense of relief afterward, but on the other hand, she thinks that by scolding students, she is a bad person. She is caught in this cycle of impulsivity and guilt. Through the first two counseling sessions, the visitor gained clarity and felt that the issues troubling her for many years were resolved. She decided to educate her students as she would her son, and after making this decision, she felt great that evening.

Therefore, whenever she encounters students who are not serious, she becomes very impulsive and cannot help but remind them forcefully, as if she is reminding her younger self, which leads her to impulsively scold the students.

No distractions, fully invested, thinking of nothing, just wanting to be with them.\" \"After years of confusion, I finally understand. Thank you, Teacher Wu,\" the visitor added.", "The next day she found me and told me that it wasn't easy to change. At that moment, I knew in my heart that a person couldn't change all at once; they should be allowed to understand and grow on their own, so I didn't point it out.", "Visitor: \"Yesterday, I thought I could change myself from now on. Treat them as my own children. Change my demands on them, and I might live a little better. But last night I had a dream about an iron tree that was very lush, with its thorns spreading out in all directions. Dad said this tree is shading the crops and hurting people, so we need to cut some of its branches. I went around the center and cut a circle of branches, but when I looked at its center, it was so small and precarious.\" He added, \"It seems like I am that iron tree. For more than ten years, those thorns have been growing out and hurting others, but if I cut them, I might not survive. I have become an iron tree; can it still bloom?\"", "Counselor: \"At that time, you felt that you would change; it was a kind of feeling and also an insight. This dream is very meaningful: the iron tree, yourself, the thorns, the shadow over the crops, being cut down, feeling small, and struggling to survive. Not cutting it down seems to cast a shadow over the crops. This dream is an earthquake in your heart, carrying an important signal. This dream appeared after you made a decision on your own after consulting with me twice.\"", "Visitor: \"It was very clear in my dream, this circle of darkness around the crops. It symbolizes that I have set my expectations for the students too high, affecting their physical and mental development.\"", "Counselor: \"Dreams are a release, an expression, a way for the body to regulate itself. Your understanding is very good. Your father represents a kind of strength in your heart, a strength that demands you to cut off the branches without hurting the child.

But as long as I can bear it and not die, that's fine. As long as I can barely endure, I'll cut as much as I can.\"", "Counselor: \"Well, you can also freely associate or reflect. I think this is too harsh on myself. Also, what do these thorns represent, and where do they come from?

I was in a good mood before sleeping, and then I had a dream. This morning I hesitated again. It seems that change is not an easy thing; it can only be approached gradually.\"", "Counselor: \"The long journey of life cultivation.\""], "experience_and_reflection": "The visitor's journey through psychotherapy has been both profound and complex, characterized by her struggle with internal contradictions and the discovery of deeper self-awareness. As her clinician, I have had the privilege of witnessing her introspective exploration and the gradual unfolding of her psychological landscape. This reflection aims to provide a more comprehensive analysis of her case, drawing from our sessions and her symbolic dream, which serves as a pivotal point in understanding her internal dynamics.\n\nAt the heart of the visitor's dilemma is a classic conflict between her superego and her id—the moral and ethical demands she places upon herself, and the raw, unfiltered emotions that drive her actions. Her superego, shaped by societal norms and personal values, demands that she be a compassionate and understanding teacher, someone who guides her students with patience and care. This aligns with her desire to be perceived as a good person, someone who contributes positively to the lives of those she teaches. However, her id, represented by her impulsive reactions and aggressive tendencies, finds expression in the way she scolds her students. This behavior, though seemingly incongruent with her values, provides her with a release of pent-up energy, a way to channel the frustration and remorse that have accumulated over years.\n\nThe dream of the iron tree, with its lush yet thorny branches, serves as a rich metaphor for her internal state. The iron tree is robust and resilient, yet its thorns are harmful to those around it. In the dream, her father's voice suggests pruning the tree to prevent it from overshadowing and harming the crops—a clear symbol of her students and the negative impact of her harshness on their development. The pruning also represents her attempt to align her actions with her moral compass, to cut away the parts of herself that she deems undesirable.\n\nThe dream's imagery of cutting the branches yet feeling precariously small afterward highlights the vulnerability she associates with change. She fears that by relinquishing her aggressive tendencies, she will lose a part of her identity, the part that has helped her navigate her own unresolved regrets and unmet needs from her past. This fear is further compounded by the realization that change is not merely an act of will but a gradual process that requires both emotional resilience and cognitive restructuring.\n\nOur sessions have illuminated how her current behavior is intricately linked to her past experiences. Her impulsivity towards her students is not just an isolated issue but a reenactment of her own unmet needs during her formative years. As a middle school student, she lacked the guidance she now fervently provides to her students, albeit in a manner that is often harsh. This re-enactment serves a dual purpose: it is an attempt to correct her past and a manifestation of her unresolved guilt for not having studied seriously when it mattered most. In scolding her students, she is, in essence, scolding her younger self, attempting to rectify her past through them.\n\nThrough dream interpretation, we have explored how her father's presence in the dream signifies an internalized voice of authority and expectation. This paternal figure embodies the strength she perceives as necessary to make changes, yet it also imposes a demand that feels burdensome. The father's insistence on cutting the branches reflects the societal and self-imposed pressure to conform to a more socially acceptable role, one that does not permit the expression of aggression.\n\nThe visitor's journey towards self-regulation involves recognizing that her aggression, though misdirected, is a form of vitality—a necessary component of her psychological makeup that requires a healthier outlet. Our discussions have focused on identifying alternative ways to channel this energy, encouraging her to find constructive means of expression that do not involve projecting her frustrations onto her students. One such method is through creative reflection and free association, practices that allow her to externalize her emotions without the negative consequences of harming others.\n\nAs we continue to work together, I have encouraged her to view the iron tree not as an adversary to be subdued but as a part of herself that holds potential for growth and transformation. By integrating this part of her identity, she can begin to harness her aggression in ways that enhance rather than detract from her relationships with her students and her son. This involves a shift from perceiving her emotions as purely negative to understanding them as signals of deeper unmet needs and desires.\n\nThe concept of gradual change is crucial in this process. Her initial determination to treat her students as her own children was a significant step forward, yet the subsequent dream highlighted the challenges inherent in such a transformation. It is essential to acknowledge that the journey towards self-improvement is not linear but rather a series of incremental steps, each contributing to the overarching goal of self-regulation and emotional balance.\n\nIn facilitating her journey, I have sought to create a therapeutic environment that fosters self-compassion and understanding. It is important for her to recognize that the thorns, while seemingly destructive, are also indicative of her resilience and capacity for growth. By approaching her emotions with curiosity and compassion, she can begin to dismantle the rigid dichotomy between her superego and id, allowing for a more integrated and harmonious self.\n\nUltimately, the visitor's case underscores the complexity of human behavior and the intricate interplay between past experiences and present actions. Her dream serves as a powerful reminder of the subconscious mind's ability to communicate profound truths through symbolic imagery. As she continues to navigate her path of self-discovery, my role is to support her in cultivating a deeper awareness of her inner landscape, empowering her to make choices that align with both her values and her emotional needs.\n\nThis expanded reflection encapsulates not only the clinical insights gained from our sessions but also the ongoing process of understanding and growth that defines the therapeutic journey. It is a testament to the transformative power of psychotherapy and the enduring human capacity for change and self-renewal.", "causes": "the lack of serious study and guidance in secondary school left her with regrets, which led her to treat the student as her past self and produce impulsive behaviors.", "symptoms": "Deliberately scolding the student, but silent about her son's mistakes; excessive worry about the child's safety; caught in a cycle of impulsivity and guilt.", "treatment_process": "Through the first two counseling sessions, the visitor recognized the root of her problem and decided to educate the student as she had educated her son, while later exploring the dream world to further understand the ego and find a more realistic way of self-regulation.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Superego and ego in conflict, tension between moral demands and primitive emotions, showing alternating impulsiveness and guilt.", "treatment_effect": "The visitor gained a deeper understanding of the self and found a self-regulatory way of gradual change."}

Consultation location: WeChat voice consultation.", "3. Source of clients: Online psychological counseling platform.", "4. Consultation Objective: Sexual Psychological Counseling", "V. Consultation Process: Mr. Zhang arranged a psychological consultation for his wife, Ms. Wang. After Ms. Wang accepted the invitation, I also invited Mr. Zhang to join the marriage and family counseling. Mr. Zhang initially wanted his wife to receive psychological counseling, but later Ms. Wang was also willing to invite Mr. Zhang to join, so Mr. Zhang agreed. Moreover, Mr. Zhang and Ms. Wang were not in the same location; Mr. Zhang was at home while Ms. Wang was on duty at her workplace. Thus, we temporarily set up an online virtual consultation room on WeChat. This was the first time in my psychological counseling history, and I believe it was a relatively successful exploration and practice. The couple met through an introduction and, due to their older age, got married three months after meeting, with the woman stating that the emotional foundation was not very solid. The man had a playful attitude after marriage, did not understand how to earn a living, and particularly enjoyed chatting with women, showing signs of being flirtatious. When he was being attentive to other women, he did not consider his wife's feelings, leading to many unpleasant incidents. However, more importantly, the couple had not had a harmonious sex life since marriage. Shortly after their wedding, the woman discovered that the man was somewhat sexually indifferent, averaging sex only once a week, or even once every two weeks or a month. Later, when the woman became pregnant, the man continued to refuse her sexual advances, citing safety concerns during pregnancy. The woman had mentioned this issue to some male and female friends, and everyone said the man was not normal, which he also admitted by acknowledging his low sexual desire. However, something later happened that deeply hurt the woman. The husband often went to the bathroom alone in the early morning hours, staying for a long time. One day, the wife accidentally discovered that her husband was in the bathroom \"masturbating\" to a photo of a friend's wife. This happened while she was pregnant with their second child. When she confronted her husband about this behavior, he shockingly replied that she was not as beautiful as the friend's wife. This statement shattered her self-esteem! She had previously thought that while she might not be exceptionally beautiful, she wasn't unattractive enough for her husband to refuse a sexual relationship with her. However, her husband's strange sexual behavior made her lose all confidence in herself! As a result, she", "The husband said that before getting married, he had a good family background and was handsome, winning the hearts of many girls. However, he was indeed a bit fickle, always choosing among these girls, and only ended up with his current wife when he got older. He developed a habit of masturbation in high school, and after getting married, he experienced premature ejaculation in his sex life. He was very worried about not being able to satisfy his wife's sexual needs, so he would hold back, which made him feel uncomfortable during their intimate moments. Later, when he had morning erections and sexual urges, he would secretly go to the bathroom to resolve it himself. To enhance his mood, he sometimes looked at pictures of his friend's wife, hoping not to be discovered by his own wife! This incident became an unresolved knot in his wife's heart, making her feel particularly inferior and repressed whenever she thought about it, leading to a nauseous feeling in her body. Eventually, this feeling generalized to feeling sick at the sight of her husband, causing frequent arguments between them. In fact, the husband also felt very guilty, believing he had harmed his wife. During one argument, he couldn't help but reveal the real reason he was unwilling to have sex with his wife. After learning the true reason behind her husband's masturbation, his wife reflected on her own issues. She said that during their honeymoon, due to her lack of understanding of sexual physiology for both genders, she thought her husband experienced sexual sensations like she did, believing it would get better with time, without considering her husband's feelings, which added to his insecurity due to premature ejaculation and increased his psychological pressure, ultimately worsening his habit of masturbation. Since that communication, their sex life has noticeably improved, and the husband has become more family-oriented. However, the knot in the wife's heart was not easily resolved. She resented her husband's \"stubborn\" nature for not revealing the real reason earlier, causing her to live with inferiority and repression for all those years. Although she rationally forgave her husband, she couldn't get over this psychological hurdle. The thought of her husband \"masturbating\" to pictures of his friend's wife made her feel sick, leading to uncontrollable outbursts of anger, and they would start arguing. A week ago, the wife was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection, which later tests revealed was related to her husband's phimosis. For her health, the husband voluntarily underwent a circumcision. During the recovery period, when they couldn't have sexual relations, the wife recalled past events, and her emotions erupted once again! That night, they had a huge fight, and the husband realized the seriousness of the situation, so he took the initiative to schedule an appointment with a psychologist for counseling.", "V. Case Analysis: Disharmony in sexual life is the main reason for the marital problems of the visiting couple. The man's feelings of inferiority prevent him from sharing his true feelings about their sex life with his wife, leading him to adopt an avoidance attitude towards the issues. The husband's avoidance behavior makes the wife mistakenly believe that the problem is her fault, which greatly damages her self-esteem and confidence. The repression, both sexual and psychological, causes significant psychological trauma to the wife. Although through their joint efforts there have been substantial changes in their married life, the \"knot\" in the wife's heart remains unresolved, and she has to seek help from professional psychological counseling.", "Six, Reflection on the Success or Failure of Consultation Goals: Our consultation goal seemed to be marriage issues, but it also involved sexual psychological problems. The disharmony in sexual life is a major cause of marriage problems. Although the issues related to sexual life were later resolved, the psychological harm caused to the wife could not be addressed. Solving the wife's psychological problems became the ultimate goal of this consultation. The entire consultation lasted for three hours, and both husband and wife were very cooperative. Later, to address the wife's distress caused by negative emotions, I ultimately used narrative therapy's emotional externalization technique to conduct a one-hour therapy session with the wife, and the results were quite good!"], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflection during the consultation process:\n\nThe journey with Mr. Zhang and Ms. Wang provided a profound opportunity to delve into the intricate layers of sexual and marital dynamics. This case reaffirmed the importance of trust, not just between client and counselor, but within the clients themselves. The experience underscored the critical need for establishing a solid foundation of trust to foster open communication and facilitate healing.\n\n1. Trust in the counseling process is paramount. As a clinician, I realized that my belief in the efficacy of the counseling process significantly impacted the confidence I projected during the session. This confidence, in turn, had a contagious effect on the clients, helping them to trust the process and each other. The three-hour session, akin to a marathon, tested the endurance of both the clients and myself. It reinforced the notion that sometimes, the most profound changes occur not in swift interventions but in the sustained engagement over time.\n\nThe initial challenge lay in addressing the \"knot\" in Ms. Wang's heart, which remained unresolved nearly two hours into the session. Her emotional blockage seemed impenetrable, and I knew that breaking through would require more than conventional dialogue. Thus, the decision to conduct a \"one-on-one\" emotional externalization therapy was pivotal. This allowed Ms. Wang to explore her emotions in a focused and protected environment, free from the immediate influence of her husband's presence.\n\n2. The emotional externalization therapy session was a significant turning point. The imagery dialogue facilitated an exploration of Ms. Wang's deep-seated emotions. By visualizing her nausea-inducing emotions as a small black dot surrounded by a bright sun and green grass, we created a metaphorical landscape where she could safely interact with her emotions. Initially, her reluctance to approach the black dot highlighted her fear and psychological fatigue. This insight led me to shift our focus to the \"sun,\" a symbol of positive energy and potential growth.\n\nEncouraging Ms. Wang to engage with the sun allowed her to harness its energy, gradually building her psychological resilience. The process of having the sun relay her dialogue with the black dot was instrumental in facilitating a transformation. The disappearance of the dot marked a significant breakthrough, symbolizing the alleviation of her emotional burden. This creative approach to therapy not only resolved her immediate distress but also empowered her with a renewed sense of agency over her emotions.\n\n3. Reflecting on the therapeutic process, I recognized the importance of follow-up and reflection. While the immediate effects of the session were promising, the enduring impact depended on how the couple integrated these changes into their daily lives. After the session, I should have ensured that Mr. Zhang actively participated in reflecting on the therapeutic journey. His understanding and acknowledgment of the process could have further solidified the changes and promoted ongoing dialogue between the couple.\n\nDuring the follow-up visit, it was heartening to hear from Mr. Zhang that Ms. Wang's mood had significantly improved. This feedback was crucial as it validated the effectiveness of the therapy and highlighted the importance of continuous support. The absence of discussions about previous unpleasant matters suggested a shift in focus, which was a positive indicator of progress.\n\n4. The narrative therapy's emotional externalization technique requires careful execution and supervision. This case highlighted its importance in addressing deep-rooted emotional issues. I am keen to seek supervision to refine this process further, ensuring that future sessions can benefit from enhanced techniques and insights. Continuous professional development and feedback are essential to improving therapeutic outcomes and maintaining a high standard of care.\n\n5. An interesting aspect of the session was the homework assignment given to Mr. Zhang. By framing the question, \"What kind of welcome gift would you like to give your wife when she comes home today?\" I aimed to encourage a proactive and affectionate gesture. His spontaneous response, \"A hug, a kiss!\" exceeded expectations, illustrating the power of open-ended questions in eliciting genuine emotional responses. This approach refrained from imposing my ideas, allowing the clients to express their authentic selves, thus fostering a more natural and effective therapeutic interaction.\n\n6. The session also provided insights into the broader dynamics of sexual psychology and marital relationships. The disharmony in their sexual life was a reflection of deeper issues concerning self-esteem, communication, and mutual understanding. Mr. Zhang's feelings of inferiority, compounded by his avoidance behavior, contributed to Ms. Wang's misconceptions about her self-worth. This cycle of misunderstanding and repression created a complex psychological landscape that required careful navigation.\n\nUnderstanding the roots of their issues involved exploring not just their sexual interactions but their emotional history and familial influences. Mr. Zhang's early experiences with masturbation and subsequent premature ejaculation highlighted the need for addressing sexual education and physiological understanding in therapy. Ms. Wang's initial lack of understanding regarding sexual physiology and its impact on her husband's psychological state emphasized the importance of comprehensive sexual education for both partners.\n\n7. The revelation of Mr. Zhang's behavior and its impact on Ms. Wang opened avenues for exploring forgiveness and emotional resilience. Despite rational forgiveness, Ms. Wang's struggle with psychological hurdles highlighted the complexity of emotional healing. Addressing these issues required fostering a safe space for emotional expression and encouraging honest communication between the couple.\n\nThe urinary tract infection diagnosis and its link to Mr. Zhang's phimosis added a layer of complexity to their relationship dynamics. This medical intervention, and the subsequent circumcision, provided an opportunity to re-evaluate their sexual relationship and health concerns. It was crucial to integrate these discussions into the therapy process, ensuring that both partners understood the importance of mutual health and wellbeing.\n\n8. Finally, the case emphasized the need for a holistic approach to therapy. While sexual issues were the catalyst for their marital discord, the psychological trauma stemming from these experiences required a broader therapeutic strategy. By integrating narrative therapy, imagery dialogue, and continuous reflection, we aimed to address both the immediate sexual issues and the underlying emotional challenges. This comprehensive approach not only facilitated immediate changes but also laid the groundwork for long-term emotional resilience and relationship growth.\n\nIn conclusion, the case of Mr. Zhang and Ms. Wang served as a powerful reminder of the complexity of marital and sexual dynamics. It reinforced the importance of trust, creativity, and comprehensive therapeutic strategies in fostering healing and growth. The insights gained from this experience will undoubtedly inform future clinical practices, ensuring that the lessons learned continue to benefit clients and clinicians alike.", "causes": "Couple's sexual disharmony, husband's low libido, premature ejaculation, low self-esteem and avoidance of communication, wife's lack of understanding of sexual physiology.", "symptoms": "wife's low self-esteem, depression, nausea, high mood swings, and frequent spousal arguments.", "treatment_process": "using imagery dialogue, narrative therapy emotional externalization techniques, guiding the wife to explore her emotions, couples participate in counseling to promote communication and understanding.", "characteristics_of_illness": "psychological trauma caused by sexual problems, emotional and sexual psychology interact with each other to form a complex psychological pattern.", "treatment_effect": "husband and wife's relationship improves, wife's emotions are significantly relieved, husband is more family-oriented, but wife's psychological disorder is still not completely eliminated."}
{"id": 177, "case_description": ["The visitor is a 19-year-old male, unmarried, and currently in his first year of undergraduate studies. He is the only child in his family. During his senior year of high school, he was diagnosed by a specialized hospital with \"anxiety,\" \"depression,\" and \"obsession.\" He took Western medication, which improved his sleep somewhat, but the effect was limited. Later, with the help of a psychological counselor, he used Morita therapy, which had better results. In July 2017, he was diagnosed at Beijing Guang'anmen Hospital with \"erectile dysfunction\" and \"kidney deficiency syndrome.\" He took traditional Chinese herbal medicine and has also consumed deer blood and Western medications for kidney enhancement. About half a month after finishing the medication, he noticed some improvement, but it became ineffective after three instances of masturbation."], "consultation_process": ["3. Consultation goal: How to escape the trap that triggers compulsive episodes?", "IV. Consultation Process: This is the visitor's sixteenth consultation. We agreed to change our meetings to once a month, but this time the visitor proactively made an appointment with me five days in advance due to an incident. During this consultation, the visitor mentioned two events that triggered his mental interactions (compulsions): One was on July 13, when the visitor was chatting with a fellow student from his university about buying a computer. Due to differences in consumer perspective and work style, the classmate said the visitor was \"particularly trashy.\" The visitor became angry and experienced a mental interaction (compulsion), and has been living in anxiety, fear, and panic ever since, feeling particularly distressed. The other incident occurred on July 10, when the visitor and the classmate from Northeast China were heading to the exam venue. Just before entering, the Northeast classmate realized he wasn't wearing his watch and went back to the dorm to get it, casually handing his exam bag to the visitor for safekeeping. Once in the exam room, the supervising teacher took the classmate's bag and placed it on a table at the back. When the classmate rushed back, he discovered the bag wasn't with the visitor and spent several minutes searching on the back table before finding it. In his frustration, the friend said a few words blaming the visitor, which triggered the visitor's mental interaction. The visitor felt wronged, as it wasn't his fault; he was trying to help but ended up receiving complaints. To quickly alleviate the impact of the mental interaction and avoid the influence of his compulsions on the exam, the visitor chose to appease the classmate for reconciliation. Once the visitor realized afterward that the classmate did not blame him, he quickly recovered from the mental interaction. The visitor knows that solving problems in this appeasing way can be exhausting, but he resorts to it as a makeshift strategy to cope with exam pressure. The visitor fears interpersonal conflict because he worries it will damage his friendship with the Northeast classmate and fears being abandoned. The conflict with the hometown classmate stemmed from feeling blamed, attacked, and belittled due to the classmate's words. However, the visitor handled these two situations differently; for instance, he did not use an appeasing approach with the hometown classmate. This difference allowed the visitor to see his growth and boost his confidence. Recognizing the \"differences\" in how he handled the situations with the hometown and Northeast friends signifies the visitor's personal growth.", "Later, we began to explore how to handle interpersonal relationships and how to resolve interpersonal conflicts that might lead to patterns of mental interaction. The visitor mentioned that there was no need to please others, as it was inappropriate to do so; pleasing others insincerely was a blow to oneself. Initially, the visitor stated that when others criticized or attacked them, they could retaliate in the same manner, which would reduce their mental interaction. In the visitor's words, they would respond as needed, and not pleasing others was a sign of growth. Later, inspired by my insights, the visitor said they wanted to address the issue in their own way, with the principle that communication should not be too harsh. The way of speaking should make both others and oneself comfortable, which would improve their interpersonal relationships and mental health. I praised this viewpoint and shared my own feelings when seeking supervision: the supervisor said that the principle of postmodern psychological counseling is to ensure that neither the visitor nor the counselor feels uncomfortable! It’s important to be transparent about one’s thoughts and provide strong support to the visitor.", "Later, the visitor began to reflect on the reasons for their current experience of mental interaction: first, their mental state had improved significantly recently, leading them to underestimate their psychological issues, and they believed they had the ability to cope with these problems. However, when they found themselves troubled by mental interaction again, the psychological contrast made them feel a greater sense of defeat! Second, when psychological issues arose, instead of following the principle of \"go with the flow and do as you please,\" they tried to take the time to thoroughly understand and resolve the problem, which only made things more confusing and distressing! The insight gained from this experience is that they need to lower their expectations and stop pursuing perfection in order to find a way out! Seeing success can provide additional strength! The strength comes from within! To interact with others in a normal manner, one should not over-interpret others' normal behaviors. This realization will help them better understand themselves in the future, avoid trying to please others, refrain from imposing strict demands on themselves, and allow themselves to listen to their inner voice! Go with the flow.", "5. Personal Analysis: The visitor is a typical case of obsessive-compulsive disorder. After fifteen sessions and twenty-two hours of counseling, the effects are significant. The frequency of obsessive-compulsive episodes is decreasing, and there is an increasing sense of control and confidence."], "experience_and_reflection": "The goal of this consultation was to explore how to escape the traps that trigger compulsive episodes. Through extensive dialogue and introspection with the client, a 19-year-old male in his first year of undergraduate studies, we have made significant progress in understanding and addressing the underlying issues of his obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This reflection serves not only as a summary of our journey but also as a broader analysis that may provide insights for other individuals facing similar challenges.\n\nThe client's journey began with a complex interplay of anxiety, depression, and obsession, diagnoses he received during his senior year of high school. Despite initial interventions with Western medication and traditional Chinese herbal treatments, the symptoms persisted, especially the compulsive episodes triggered by interpersonal conflicts. Through collaborative-oriented dialogue therapy, the client has gradually gained a deeper understanding of his psychological landscape, and this reflection aims to encapsulate that growth.\n\nOne of the critical insights gained is the importance of lowering expectations and resisting the pursuit of perfection. This realization has been pivotal for the client in reducing the frequency and intensity of compulsive episodes. The notion of \"perfection\" often creates an unrealistic standard that fuels anxiety and obsession. By learning to accept imperfections and embrace a more flexible approach to challenges, the client has found a path to empowerment. This empowerment is rooted in an internal strength, a realization that success is not merely an external validation but an intrinsic state of self-acceptance and resilience.\n\nOur consultations have also illuminated the significance of not overinterpreting others' normal behaviors. The client frequently fell into a cognitive trap where he would dissect and magnify social interactions, attributing negative intentions to benign actions. This pattern not only exacerbated his compulsive tendencies but also strained his relationships. By learning to take interactions at face value and responding with measured and thoughtful communication, the client has begun to cultivate healthier interpersonal relationships. This shift is evident in his interactions with peers, where he now prioritizes authentic dialogue over appeasement or confrontation.\n\nA recurring theme in our sessions has been the client's struggle with interpersonal conflict and the fear of abandonment. These fears have historically triggered compulsive episodes, leading to a cycle of anxiety and mental turmoil. Through therapy, the client has recognized that his compulsion to please others was a defense mechanism against these fears. By addressing the root cause of this compulsion, we have worked towards developing strategies that foster genuine connections without the need for constant validation. The client's decision to handle conflicts differently, such as in his interactions with his hometown and Northeast classmates, is a testament to his growth. He has learned that conflict resolution does not necessitate compromising his integrity or self-worth.\n\nReflecting on the consultation process, it is evident that the client's psychological recovery is non-linear, characterized by progress and occasional setbacks. These setbacks, such as the two compulsive episodes that occurred within a month, highlight the spiraling nature of recovery. It is crucial to acknowledge that healing is not a straight path but rather a journey with ebbs and flows. This understanding has informed our approach, emphasizing patience and persistence, and cautioning against rushing the conclusion of psychological counseling.\n\nInterestingly, as the consultations progressed, the focus naturally gravitated towards interpersonal relationships. This shift underscores the intrinsic link between psychological well-being and social connections. The client's initial concern about masturbation, which he feared exacerbated his compulsive symptoms, became secondary as we delved into the complexities of his social interactions. This evolution reflects a broader truth: many psychological issues are deeply intertwined with interpersonal dynamics. Humans are inherently social creatures, and our mental health is often a reflection of our relationships with others.\n\nAs the client became more adept in therapy, the nature of our sessions transformed. The client's capacity for self-discovery and self-elevation increased, leading to a more fluid and dynamic consultation process. He demonstrated an ability to independently raise questions, analyze issues, and devise solutions, signifying a transition towards autonomy in managing his mental health. This development is a critical milestone, as it equips the client with the skills necessary to navigate future challenges independently.\n\nDuring the later stages of our consultations, the client expressed a desire for final advice or suggestions as our sessions neared conclusion. In response, I shared my reflections on the consultation process, emphasizing the importance of transparency and mutual support in our therapeutic relationship. This exchange not only strengthened our rapport but also reinforced the client's confidence in facing and resolving his issues. The client acknowledged that the collaborative nature of our work had made him feel supported and empowered.\n\nIn conclusion, the journey through therapy has been transformative for the client. By lowering expectations, embracing imperfections, and fostering authentic interpersonal relationships, he has made significant strides in managing his obsessive-compulsive disorder. This reflection serves as a testament to the power of introspection, dialogue, and a supportive therapeutic alliance in facilitating psychological growth. As the client continues on this path, he carries with him the insights and skills acquired through our work, poised to navigate the complexities of life with resilience and self-awareness.", "causes": "anxiety, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder diagnosis since high school, interpersonal conflict, fear of abandonment and other psychological factors", "symptoms": "obsessive-compulsive disorder, obsessive thinking and behavior, symptoms worsened during interpersonal conflicts.", "treatment_process": "Western medicine, Morita therapy, etc., followed by cooperation-oriented dialogue therapy, analysis of interpersonal conflicts and psychological interactions, and adjustment of cognition and behavior.", "characteristics_of_illness": "The frequency of obsessive-compulsive disorder episodes decreased, the sense of control and self-confidence increased, but the disease has ups and downs.", "treatment_effect": "symptoms improved, psychological rehabilitation progressed, learning to lower expectations, accepting imperfections, establishing healthy interpersonal relationships, and transitioning to autonomous management of mental health."}

Xiao Yu is an only child, raised by his parents since childhood, and he has a good emotional communication with them. His growing environment has been relatively smooth and ordinary, without any traumatic experiences. Today, his mother accompanied him here. During their conversation a few minutes ago, I sensed that his mother has a gentle personality, is knowledgeable and reasonable, and they belong to a relatively normal and harmonious family.

At that moment, I thought his photo looked a bit silly and cute, so I took a picture of it and sent it to our class group, along with a message saying, \"Looking like a fool.\" I forgot about it after sending it, but in the evening, my mom came to school, only to find out that my classmate was very angry and had told the teacher about the incident. The teacher then notified my mom to come to school for a talk. This was the first incident.", "On the morning of April 20-something, I had just gotten up and wasn't fully awake yet when my roommate said to me, \"Your seat is such a mess, aren't you going to tidy it up? Damn it, you can't even manage your own hygiene, do you expect me to do it for you?\" I was instantly furious and rushed up to him, saying, \"Say that again, do you believe I’ll choke you to death, do you believe I’ll poison you?\" My roommate looked a bit dazed from my outburst and said, \"Are you stupid or something?\" and then walked away. After that incident, I didn't think much of it.", "After returning from the May Day holiday, I noticed that many classmates seemed to feel strange about themselves. It wasn't until the teacher spoke to me that I found out that after the last conflict with my roommate, he requested to change dorms at school. Generally, the school cannot allow a dormitory change without a valid reason, so my classmate reported our conflict to the school. The school teacher then talked to me and informed my parents to come to school, marking this as the second incident.", "Later, I changed a classmate's name in the class group, and no one knew who it was, wondering if I had added the wrong group. Everyone started discussing how to manage the class group. After finding out what had happened, the classmate whose name I changed felt very angry and informed the teacher, leading to my mom being notified to come to school again. This was the third incident.", "Through Xiaoyu's statement, I repeatedly confirmed the course of events, especially inquiring about and clarifying the details of the conflict with his classmates, including the words, context, tone, and body language.", "Next, data was collected on Xiaoyu's growth experiences, family medical history, upbringing methods, and other aspects.", "Xiaoyu is an only child who grew up beside his parents. In his memories, he has mostly grown up alone, with very few blood-related siblings accompanying him. He feels quite lonely inside, and most of his time growing up was spent watching TV and doing homework, with little outdoor activity.", "Phase Two: Repair and Analysis Stage (2 hours)", "Through the first phase of consultation, I established a relatively good trust relationship with Xiaoyu and have a clearer understanding of his issues in my mind.", "I had a relatively in-depth conversation with Xiao Yu through questioning. In the back-and-forth exchange, Xiao Yu began to understand the motivations behind his behavior. Due to not having playmates since childhood, he feels quite lonely inside and doesn't really understand the nuances of interacting with others. Sometimes, he likes to do unexpected things in hopes of attracting others' attention. When verbal conflicts arise, he doesn't consider others' feelings; sometimes, when his emotions are out of control, he may use some extreme language to try to suppress the other person. However, he does have a sense of right and wrong in his heart and doesn't genuinely intend to attack or harm others.", "Through my guidance, Xiaoyu fully understood his inner motivations and recognized his inappropriate behaviors in interpersonal interactions and their consequences. I also guided him on how to learn to establish good social relationships with classmates, consider others' feelings, and fully understand the golden rule of interpersonal relationships, which is: \"Treat others the way you wish to be treated.\"", "Next, we studied Ellis's ABC theory, also known as Rational Emotive Therapy. Ellis believed that the quality of a person's emotions is mainly determined by their cognition and thoughts about the event they experienced. This forms the basic viewpoint of the \"Emotional ABC Theory.\" In the ABC theoretical model, A refers to the activating event; B refers to the individual's beliefs that arise in response to the activating event, that is, their views, interpretations, and thoughts about that event; C refers to the emotional and behavioral outcomes of the individual in a specific situation.", "The negative emotions and behavioral disorders of individuals (C) are not directly triggered by a specific activating event (A), but are directly caused by the erroneous beliefs (B) resulting from the individual's incorrect cognition and evaluation of that event. Erroneous beliefs are also known as irrational beliefs.", "In light of Xiaoyu's case, if a classmate insults you first, do you really have to get angry and upset? This is determined by your own perception; it's not the classmate's insult that leads to Event C, but rather your perception of the situation that causes Event C. If you change your perception B, you might consider whether the classmate was having a particularly bad day or facing some troubling issues, which led to their poor attitude towards you. Understanding is the universal key to tolerance, allowing you to manage your negative emotions reasonably through comprehension.", "Phase Three: Experience and Conclusion Phase (2 hours)", "Through previous conversations and communications, Xiaoyu has gained a deeper and clearer understanding of his issues. Next, I conducted a situational simulation with Xiaoyu using the nesting doll technique. The simulation consists of three parts: the first part is a reenactment of the entire process of the argument between Xiaoyu and his classmate; the second part involves role reversal, where Xiaoyu plays the classmate and I play him, allowing us to experience different emotions and consider each other's feelings; the third part has me playing the classmate again, while Xiaoyu responds to me with a new perspective after changing his mindset, practicing how to alleviate emotional pressure during aggressive verbal exchanges, fully understanding the other party in order to achieve a dialogue technique that transforms enemies into friends.", "The situational pattern of the third part is roughly as follows:", "I said, \"Your seat is so messy, aren't you going to clean it up? Damn it, you can't take care of your own hygiene and expect me to do it for you?\"", "Xiao Yu said, \"Why are you so explosive this early in the morning? I'll clean up the mess in a bit. Did something happen to you? Are you in a bad mood?\"", "By accepting each other's emotions and genuinely caring for one another, they successfully resolved mutual hostility, avoiding unnecessary disputes and conflicts.", "During the last consultation, Xiaoyu created a sand tray named \"Vibrant Desert,\" which displayed a beautiful scene of animals and humans living together in harmony. Through his explanation of the sand tray, I sensed Xiaoyu's pure and kind-hearted nature, and I also saw a soul full of love and vitality."], "experience_and_reflection": "Upon reflecting on Xiao Yu's case, it becomes evident that his social anxiety issues are multifaceted and deeply rooted in his upbringing and social interactions, or lack thereof. As a clinician, revisiting the details of Xiao Yu's journey through our sessions offers a richer perspective on the complexity of his experiences and the subsequent impact on his psychological health.\n\nXiao Yu's solitary childhood, primarily spent without the company of peers or siblings, appears to have fundamentally shaped his understanding of social interactions. This lack of social exposure and the absence of a sibling dynamic may have contributed to his difficulty in navigating the nuances of interpersonal communication. The solitary nature of his upbringing likely restricted his ability to develop essential social skills, such as empathy, conflict resolution, and the ability to interpret social cues effectively. This is a common challenge observed in individuals who grow up in environments where opportunities for social engagement are limited.\n\nAnalyzing Xiao Yu's behavioral patterns, it's clear that his outbursts and conflicts with classmates stem from a deeper emotional disconnect. The incidents he described suggest a tendency to react impulsively and defensively when faced with criticism or confrontation. This impulsive reaction can be linked to an underlying insecurity and a lack of self-assuredness in his social role, leading to an overcompensation through aggressive or extreme speech. Such behavior is indicative of a defense mechanism to mask his vulnerability and fear of social rejection.\n\nFurthermore, Xiao Yu's perception of events and his consequent reactions are influenced by what Rational Emotive Therapy identifies as \"irrational beliefs.\" His tendency to perceive benign comments or actions as personal attacks highlights the cognitive distortions at play. These distortions exacerbate his social anxiety, as his interpretations of social interactions are often skewed towards the negative. Through the ABC model, we explored how Xiao Yu's beliefs about social encounters lead to heightened emotional responses and maladaptive behaviors. By challenging these beliefs, Xiao Yu began to understand that his perceptions, rather than the events themselves, were the primary catalysts for his emotional turmoil.\n\nA pivotal moment in our sessions was when Xiao Yu began to recognize his role in the cycle of conflict. This self-awareness marked a significant step towards personal growth and emotional regulation. By understanding the motivations behind his behavior, Xiao Yu showed a willingness to change, which is crucial for therapeutic progress. This realization was reinforced through experiential learning techniques, such as role-playing and situational simulations, which allowed Xiao Yu to practice new ways of responding to social stressors in a safe environment.\n\nThe role-playing exercises, particularly the nesting doll technique, were instrumental in helping Xiao Yu gain empathy and perspective-taking skills. By reversing roles, Xiao Yu was able to experience firsthand the impact of his words and actions from the perspective of his classmates. This exercise not only enhanced his understanding of others' emotions but also helped him develop a more nuanced approach to conflict resolution. The practice of adopting a new mindset during these simulations highlighted the power of cognitive restructuring in altering emotional and behavioral outcomes.\n\nThroughout our sessions, Xiao Yu demonstrated a commendable openness to introspection and learning. His creation of the \"Vibrant Desert\" sand tray was a profound expression of his inner world and aspirations for harmony. This creative exercise revealed Xiao Yu's inherent desire for peaceful coexistence and connection, contrasting with his previous behavior patterns. The sand tray served as a metaphorical representation of his journey towards emotional balance and social integration.\n\nIn conclusion, Xiao Yu's case underscores the importance of early socialization and emotional education in the development of healthy interpersonal skills. His progress through therapy illustrates the potential for cognitive and behavioral change when individuals are provided with the tools to understand and reshape their internal narratives. The therapeutic journey has equipped Xiao Yu with a deeper awareness of his psychological landscape and the motivation to foster positive relationships. Moving forward, it is my hope that Xiao Yu will continue to build on these insights, using them as a foundation for a more socially engaged and emotionally resilient life. His journey serves as a reminder of the transformative power of therapy in helping individuals overcome personal challenges and achieve psychological growth.", "causes": "Only child, lack of playmates in childhood, internalized loneliness, resulting in a one-sided understanding of social interactions and lack of opportunities for development of key social skills.", "symptoms": "Social anxiety.", "treatment_process": "Data collection assessment; guided self-awareness, cognitive restructuring; role-playing exercises, experiential learning.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Social anxiety, emotional impulsivity, irrational beliefs, lack of social skills.

Due to limited space for publication, not all cases can be uploaded; we appreciate your understanding!"], "consultation_process": ["On April 17, 2010, at 8:30 AM, two visitors from a remote impoverished mountainous area of the province came seeking help. A father brought his son, who has a mental disorder. I asked the father to describe in detail the mental and physical state of the son before and after the onset of his condition, including aspects such as personality, emotions, language, and behavior, as well as the structure and emotional relationships within the family. The father said, \"My son is 22 years old this year. He was mischievous as a child, introverted, and stubborn. However, he is quite intelligent and learns quickly from what he is exposed to. He has made significant progress in acquiring cultural knowledge and skills, especially in repairing motor vehicles. He often compares his academic performance with that of his sister, who is eight years older. My wife and I have always spoiled this son; we try our best to meet his needs as long as we can, so he has enjoyed more mental and material comforts than his sister. However, when he was in the second year of middle school, my wife and I often argued. The cause of our arguments was that my wife had been running a small household appliance shop on her own for more than a year, but it was always operating at a loss. I couldn't see any good prospects for the business. Therefore, I discussed with her the possibility of stopping the business, saying that we could accept our losses. Moreover, when the products she sold had quality issues, her supplier took no responsibility or financial loss. How could we continue such a business? However, she disagreed with my thoughts and insisted on continuing. Many people who knew her also thought she had been brainwashed; otherwise, how could she disregard the economic gains or losses? At that time, our family was not well-off; we had to support two children in school, and most of the startup capital for the business was borrowed by her. Once the buying and selling cycle started, it required a significant amount of follow-up funding. We simply could not afford such a large financial demand. Sigh! Our family couldn't withstand such turmoil caused by her, and after multiple unsuccessful attempts to persuade and stop her, we had no choice but to opt for divorce to relieve our estrangement and pain. At that time, my daughter was in college, and my son was in the third year of middle school. I took on the custody of both children, while she chose to persist in running her business alone, and we hastily agreed to divorce. In that family atmosphere, it didn't affect my daughter much because she lived away from home and only returned during holidays. However, my son was in the third year of middle school, and perhaps due to his young age and witnessing the experiences of his parents' arguments and divorce every day, he barely managed to finish middle school and didn't want to continue his education. He even took the initiative to stop studying. At home, he would lock himself in his room all day, gloomy and depressed. He was unwilling to talk to anyone or see anyone, even ignoring me and his sister. Even when we tried to engage him in conversation, he would not respond, and when asked questions, he would remain silent. He stayed at home like this for nearly a year. Later, I don't know how he found out about a fast-track training school where he could learn auto repair in just six months. Before graduating, he called me to say that the knowledge and skills he learned in the fast class were very limited, and he wanted to enroll in a longer program for auto repair, asking me to prepare a large sum of tuition. When I heard him ask for tuition, I was stunned. Sigh! I'm just a bricklayer from a poor rural area; I hardly earn much in a year, and I have to support my daughter in college and the family's expenses. Where could I find extra money for him to enroll in that long program for auto repair? So, I helplessly told him that we no longer had money for his tuition, and I said, even if you sold me, you probably couldn't raise that amount. After graduating from the fast-track class, the training school recommended him to work at a small auto repair company with a monthly salary of 1,100 yuan. However, after working there for a while, he found the job dirty and tiring, with low pay and poor conditions, so he voluntarily quit and returned home. At that time, I felt that he seemed to be fine in various aspects. He stayed home for a while before choosing a vocational high school that we could afford, where he studied construction engineering design skills. However, after six months, a teacher from the vocational school called me to say that they had noticed my son sometimes talking to himself and laughing inexplicably, indicating that his state was no longer suitable for continuing his studies, and that he might have a mental health issue. The teacher urged me to take him to see a doctor. I immediately went to the school to pick him up and took him to the central hospital in the city for a consultation. Based on my son's symptoms, the hospital had him undergo psychological assessments. The psychologist first had him undergo a brain CT scan and an electrocardiogram. When the results came back, the psychologist said both tests were normal, but based on my son's current mental state, he diagnosed him with depression. The doctor prescribed medication to alleviate his condition and control the symptoms' progression, giving him oral medications to regulate his mood and calm him down, advising us to try one course of treatment and see how it goes. My son completed three courses of medication, but I noticed he was very sleepy, and his condition did not show any improvement. My daughter had just started her job less than a year ago as a doctor in a general hospital in another city. Recently, she brought her boyfriend, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, home for a visit. They looked at the medications my son was taking and said they weren't effective. Her boyfriend took my son's pulse using traditional Chinese medicine techniques and said he had excessive internal heat, which might be causing negative emotions due to anger, leading to extreme attitudes and behaviors. He prescribed 15 doses of herbal medicine to detoxify and cool him down. However, after taking these medicines, my son showed no noticeable effects. \n\nSpecific consultation process: I asked the father of the seeker whether there was a family history of this condition. The father replied, \"In our family, there is no history of this type of condition.\" I asked him to describe his child's social interactions, attitudes, behaviors, and emotional changes over the past nearly five years. The father said, \"In these years, he has rarely wanted to interact with others. Compared to before, there has been a significant change in his personality. His behavior is strange, his daily routine is irregular, and he no longer cares about personal hygiene. He has become emotionally distant. In the past two years, he does not talk to others (including when I ask him something, he does not respond). When he loses his temper, he often engages in destructive behavior (such as smashing doors and windows, dismantling heating systems and pipes, or throwing other objects). In the last three months, he has attempted to start fires on the nearby mountain twice, but when the fire started, he went to put it out. Fortunately, some villagers working in the fields noticed it in time and came to extinguish the fire, preventing a disaster. I am very worried about his inappropriate behaviors and fear that he might cause trouble, but we cannot stop him from acting. Regarding why he exhibits these abnormal attitudes and behaviors, I am also puzzled and cannot understand why he is like this. I feel helpless and do not know what to do. \n\nI observed the seeker's current mental state: his hair was long and messy, his facial expression was stiff, his clothes were disheveled, and his fingernails were long and filled with black dirt, looking very dirty. His emotions seemed unstable as he sat there, occasionally rubbing his feet back and forth on the ground, revealing a state of restlessness. Based on his current mental state, I tried to communicate with him verbally to assess his perception and logical thinking. I asked the seeker, \"What is your name? How old are you this year? What do you think about or do at home every day?\" The seeker weakly replied, \"Hong Gang, 22,\" then fell silent... I said, \"Oh, that’s a nice name, but your voice is too quiet. Was your voice this quiet before?\" He shook his head, saying no. I asked, \"What year were you born?\" He replied, \"1988.\" I continued, \"What do you think about every day lately?\" He gasped and said, \"I haven't thought about anything.\" I asked, \"Ah! You haven't thought about anything. How do you plan your life?\" He responded, \"I haven't thought...\""], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on the case of Hong Gang, a young man grappling with significant psychological distress, I am reminded of the complex interplay between individual, familial, and societal factors in the development and manifestation of mental health disorders. Hong Gang's case is a poignant illustration of how early life experiences, family dynamics, and socio-economic challenges can converge to impact mental well-being.\n\nHaving spent decades in the field of psychology, I have learned that understanding the roots of psychological distress requires a nuanced examination of the individual's life story. In Hong Gang's situation, the family environment played a pivotal role. The discord between his parents, particularly their disagreements over financial matters, created an atmosphere of tension and instability. This familial strife, culminating in divorce, likely had a profound impact on Hong Gang during his formative years. The dissolution of his parents' marriage, occurring as he transitioned from childhood to adolescence, would have been a source of emotional upheaval, contributing to his withdrawal and subsequent educational challenges.\n\nHong Gang's behavior, characterized by social withdrawal, irregular routines, and emotional detachment, aligns with the symptoms often associated with schizophrenia. However, his story also highlights the difficulties in obtaining an accurate diagnosis, as initial medical consultations suggested depression. This misdiagnosis underscores the importance of comprehensive assessments in mental health, where understanding the individual's full context is crucial for accurate identification and treatment of disorders. The complexity of Hong Gang's symptoms, including his periods of inexplicable laughter and self-dialogue, suggest a deeper psychotic disorder rather than mere depression.\n\nThe therapeutic approach employed in this case, \"Psychology of Form and Intention and Integrated Therapy of Kindness and Authority,\" provided a framework for addressing Hong Gang's psychological needs. This method emphasizes the balance between compassion and firmness, encouraging positive behavioral changes while acknowledging the individual's experiences and emotions. The 'carrot and stick' approach, which balances encouragement with boundaries, is particularly relevant in cases like Hong Gang's, where behavioral regulation is a significant concern.\n\nThe consultation process revealed the extent of Hong Gang's internal struggle. His lack of engagement with the world, coupled with his erratic behavior and emotional volatility, paints a picture of a young man in deep distress. The incidents of destructive behavior and attempts to start fires suggest a cry for help, an external manifestation of internal chaos. These actions, while alarming, also indicate a need for understanding rather than punitive measures. They reflect his struggle to process and express overwhelming emotions.\n\nAs I engaged with Hong Gang and his father, it became evident that the therapeutic journey needed to extend beyond traditional methods. The role of the therapist in such cases is not only to provide treatment but also to act as a mediator, helping the family understand and navigate the complexities of mental illness. For Hong Gang's father, this meant coming to terms with his son's condition and learning how to support him without enabling destructive behaviors.\n\nOne of the more challenging aspects of this case was addressing the family's expectations and beliefs about mental health. The father's initial reliance on medication and traditional remedies highlights a common misconception that mental illness can be 'cured' through pharmacological or alternative means alone. Educating the family about the chronic nature of schizophrenia and the need for ongoing management was a crucial part of the therapeutic process. This education involved shifting the focus from seeking a quick fix to understanding the importance of consistent therapeutic interventions, lifestyle adjustments, and family support.\n\nThe use of traditional Chinese medicine, while not effective in altering Hong Gang's condition, was an important cultural consideration. It demonstrated the family's willingness to explore various avenues for healing, even if the results were not as hoped. This openness provided a foundation for introducing evidence-based psychological interventions, emphasizing the need for an integrative approach that respects cultural practices while ensuring that treatment is grounded in scientific understanding.\n\nIn reflecting on this case, I am reminded of the importance of a holistic approach to therapy. Effective treatment for schizophrenia involves addressing biological, psychological, and social factors. This triadic model of care is essential for fostering recovery and improving quality of life. For Hong Gang, this meant developing a tailored intervention plan that included medication management, cognitive-behavioral strategies to address thought patterns and behaviors, and social skills training to enhance his ability to interact with others.\n\nThe therapeutic process also highlighted the importance of patience and persistence. Progress in cases like Hong Gang's can be slow and non-linear, with setbacks and challenges along the way. It is crucial for both the therapist and the family to maintain hope and resilience, recognizing that recovery is a journey rather than a destination.\n\nAs a psychotherapist, I am continuously reminded of the profound impact that early life experiences and family dynamics have on mental health. Hong Gang's case serves as a reminder of the need for early intervention and support for children and adolescents experiencing familial discord. Providing resources and counseling for families in crisis can help mitigate the long-term psychological effects on children, potentially preventing the development of more severe mental health issues later in life.\n\nIn conclusion, Hong Gang's case is a testament to the complexity of mental health disorders and the need for comprehensive, culturally sensitive, and individualized care. It underscores the importance of understanding the interplay of various factors in mental health, advocating for a collaborative approach that involves the individual, family, and broader social systems. Through this case, I am reminded of the transformative power of therapy and the role of the therapist as a guide and ally in the journey towards mental well-being.", "causes": "family conflicts, parental divorce and financial stress, individual experiences withdrawn behaviors and fails to intervene in a timely manner.", "symptoms": "Social withdrawal, abnormal behavior, emotional detachment, self-talk, inexplicable laughter, destructive behavior such as arson.", "treatment_process": "\"Formal and Intentional Psychology and Compassionate and Authoritative Integrative Therapy\", combined with psychological intervention, medication, and supplemented with Chinese medicine attempts.", "characteristics_of_illness": "unstable mental state, abnormal behavior and emotions, confused logical thinking, inner struggle, lack of interaction with the world.", "treatment_effect": "long-term medication management and psychological intervention are needed, treatment progress is slow, family and social support is needed, and recovery is a long-term process."}
{"id": 180, "case_description": ["Lingling, female, 20 years old, a junior student. She has been interning at an elementary school for two months and will graduate and return home to teach at a designated elementary school in a little over a month. She states that her relationship with her new roommate is not harmonious, and she feels that the teachers and leaders at her internship elementary school do not welcome her. She often argues with her mother on the phone and feels that everything around her is different from her life on campus, which makes her feel very uncomfortable. Therefore, she wants to talk to someone. In their first meeting, she is very casual, speaks loudly, and talks a lot. When discussing her internship experiences, she shows a lot of complaints and seems to have endless grievances about people and things, feeling very tired of handling various interpersonal relationships."], "consultation_process": ["1. First Consultation  \nDuring the first consultation, I learned that the visitor had recently been troubled by many things. Through her own choices, she discovered that the issue she most wanted to resolve was the conflict with her new roommate. During the consultation, I identified some of her irrational beliefs characterized by absolutism, and through questioning, she seemed to gain some insights. By using the empty chair technique, I helped her see that the conflict might exist because she hadn't communicated with her roommate in a timely manner.  \nMe: Please, have a seat.  \nLingling: I want to sit over there; it's cooler there, and I'm really hot.  \nMe: Sure, let's sit under the air conditioning.  \nLingling: Great, let's get started.  \nMe: Alright, just to clarify, everything we talk about will be kept confidential, unless you have thoughts of harming others or yourself, so you can say anything here; it's very safe.  \nLingling: It's fine, I trust you. I just feel really troubled lately; nothing seems to be going well.  \nMe: Hmm, you feel quite troubled lately.  \nLingling: Yes, I'm currently interning outside, and it feels so different from school. My roommates aren't as friendly as the ones in school, and the teachers are quite strict. I got criticized for the slightest mistake, and even when I called my mom, she scolded me. I really feel like these people are driving me crazy.  \nMe: You mentioned that your relationship with your roommate isn't good, the teachers at your internship are strict, and you had a conflict with your mom. Which issue do you want to resolve the most right now?  \nLingling: Well, a couple of days ago, I had a big fight with one of my roommates. Now we don't eat together anymore; when she eats, I don't, and vice versa. Basically, I eat more while she often just buys a bun and sits on the sofa nibbling it. I think it's not good to have this awkwardness since we live under the same roof. So please help me resolve the conflict with my roommate.  \nMe: Can you tell me specifically what caused the argument with your roommate?  \nLingling: It was over a small matter. You know, we don't have a cafeteria to eat at now, so we have to buy groceries and cook for ourselves. There are four of us in the dorm, and I thought we could take turns buying groceries and cooking, each contributing 100 yuan as a shared expense, to avoid the hassle of calculating costs daily. But she didn't want to do it that way; she insisted that we split the costs each time we buy groceries. I didn't dare to confront her directly at the time, but when I talked to my best friend that night, I mentioned her, and she might have overheard. After I hung up, she confronted me, asking why I was being secretive. That really made me angry, and we ended up arguing.  \nMe: So, you think that because you arranged everything, everyone else should follow your plan, right?  \nLingling: Yes, I mean, don't you think my plan is better? And you know, our dorm group chat is filled with records of who bought what groceries and how much each person owes. I think that's too troublesome; is the only thing left between roommates just financial transactions? It's ridiculous.  \nMe: Have you communicated your thoughts on this matter with your roommate? Have you heard everyone's opinions?  \nLingling: What's there to talk about? It's obvious my method is better. Who wants to deal with that hassle? Or do you think my method isn't good?  \nMe: No, I think your method is good. If I were in your situation, I might handle it the same way, but I would communicate with my roommate first, explaining why I think this way and listen to everyone's opinions. Do you think that would work better?  \nLingling: ...Maybe... What should I do now? We live together every day, and this can't go on.  \nMe: It sounds like you really want to improve your relationship with your roommate. What can you do to ease the conflict?  \nLingling: ...I think I should apologize. If she apologizes to me first, I promise I'll forgive her. It's just a small matter; there's no need to be petty about it.  \nMe: So, you mean the conflict can only ease if your roommate apologizes to you?  \nLingling: Yes, she started this whole thing, and I've never apologized to anyone; I can't bring myself to do it. After I argue with my mom, I wait until she calms down and then she calls me first.  \nMe: Do you think your roommate will apologize to you first? Or how long do you think it will take for her to apologize?  \nLingling: I don't know. We've been in conflict for several days, and she hasn't talked to me at all. Sometimes I almost can't help but speak to her. I feel I'm not that angry anymore, but I just can't lower my pride to say something first.  \nMe: Do you think if you spoke to her first, your relationship would improve?  \nLingling: It might, but what if I talk to her and she ignores me? That would be really awkward for me.  \nMe: You're waiting for her to speak first because you're worried about being ignored if you take the initiative, right?  \nLingling: Yeah, I'm afraid it would be awkward... But I feel she might not be that unreasonable.  \nMe: Imagine if you were to speak to her first, what would you say?  \nLingling: Since we're not eating dinner together anymore, the other two roommates are still eating together, and I feel the atmosphere is really strange, so maybe I would invite her to have dinner with me.  \nMe: Good, it seems you already have an idea. If you say that, what do you think her reaction would be?  \nLingling: She should come over with her bun, since buns aren't as tasty as meals, and she’s usually quite a friendly person.  \nMe: Alright, now that you are having dinner together, is there anything you'd like to say to her? Choose a chair and imagine your roommate is sitting there. What do you see? What is her expression?  \nLingling: She’s holding a bun and looking at me a bit shyly, but it seems like she's waiting for me to say something.  \nMe: Would you like to say something to her?  \nLingling: ...Dandan... We haven't eaten together in a long time. About what happened last time, it wasn't intentional. You know how I am; I tend to say whatever comes to mind. When I talked to my friend about our situation, everyone was probably really angry, and I couldn't help but argue with you.  \nMe: Now please sit in that chair and act as your roommate.  \nLingling as her roommate: I've been thinking about this too. It was my fault for not holding back. I really didn't want to do it your way regarding the groceries. You didn't say anything at the time, so I thought it was over. I didn’t expect you to call me strange when you talked to your friend, and I felt a bit angry.  \nMe: Your roommate said she didn’t want to do it your way. What would you like to say to her? Now please return to your own chair.  \nLingling: Buying groceries this way every day and calculating the money is a bit troublesome. You see, our group chat is only about buying groceries. I think as roommates, we might have more to share together. If you think 100 yuan is too much, we can contribute 50 or 30 at a time. We can pay some money as shared expenses, so we don't have to get caught up in these small matters every day and have more time to do other interesting things, right?  \nMe: Alright, after hearing you say this, do you think your roommate would agree to your arrangement? Please sit over there and act as your roommate.  \nLingling as her roommate: So that's how you think, huh? I hope you can clearly communicate your ideas with us in the future, rather than saying nothing when we disagree with you.  \nMe: You heard your roommate say she hopes you can express your thoughts more. Do you think you can do that?  \nLingling: Hmm... So it turns out I didn’t explain clearly to them...  \nMe: Great, I believe you know what to do now. Let's stop here for today. We'll meet at the same time next week.  \nLingling: Okay, thank you.  \n\n2. Second Consultation  \nAfter the first consultation, the conflict with her roommate eased, but this time she came with a new issue, which also stemmed from insufficient communication, leading to misunderstandings. Since the empty chair technique was very helpful in the last session, I decided to use it again to help her realize her communication shortcomings.  \nMe: You seem to be in a good mood today.  \nLingling: Yes, I want to tell you that now we're back to eating together as four people. After I returned home last time, that night I invited Dandan to eat with us, and everyone opened up. It really didn’t seem like a big issue. She even came with me today.  \nMe: That's great; it sounds like you did really well after going back. What do you want to talk about today?  \nLingling: I don't know. Overall, my mood this week has been quite good, but I feel like I'm a bit forgetful, and it seems to be a problem.  \nMe: Hmm, what happened?  \nLingling: I feel like I keep unintentionally upsetting others without realizing it. I don’t know what’s happening, and it feels like others are giving me the cold shoulder. Why are people so complicated?  \nMe: You mean you don't know what you did to make others unhappy?  \nLingling: Yes. This week, one of my teachers spoke to me sarcastically. She used to take care of me; every time I asked her questions, she would patiently share her experiences with me. But last Tuesday, when I asked if I could sit in on her class, she said, \"What's so good about my class? The level isn't high; don’t bother coming.\" I felt a bit strange, but I couldn’t think of why she suddenly said that.  \nMe: You said you don't understand why the teacher's attitude towards you changed suddenly?  \nLingling: Yes, I feel like I did something that made her unhappy, and that's why she spoke to me that way, but I really can't remember what it was. That afternoon, after class, I heard some teachers discussing how today's interns really have no sense of etiquette, saying it's them who come to listen to the class, and then leave abruptly. I remembered that one day I went to listen to that teacher’s class, and halfway through, I suddenly remembered I had to substitute for another teacher's class, and I hadn’t quite finished my presentation materials, so I told the teacher I had to leave early. I meant to explain it to her after class, but I forgot, and I didn't expect her to be really angry.  \nMe: You can’t understand why the teacher would be angry?  \nLingling: No, actually I think leaving suddenly isn't good, but I had no choice; I had to teach the next class, and I didn't have time. I think my forgetfulness caused all this trouble. If I hadn’t forgotten about my class, I wouldn’t have asked to sit in, and I wouldn’t have left halfway, and the teacher wouldn’t have felt disrespected. Even if I did that, if I hadn’t forgotten later, I could have explained things to her in time. I think she would have understood me. So, I think forgetfulness is a bad thing. Do you have any way to help me get rid of this bad habit? It’s really annoying.  \nMe: Forgetfulness is indeed not a good thing for us. Our memory can be affected by many factors, and everyone can suddenly forget something for some reason. Since this is something we all inevitably face, can we find ways to remedy the things that were delayed due to forgetfulness?  \nLingling: Does everyone forget things? Do you forget things too?  \nMe: Yes, we need to accurately recognize the problems that exist within us.  \nLingling: So what should I do now? I've left a bad impression on those teachers, and I still have over a month of internship left.  \nMe: Hmm, if you want to change the impression you leave on the teachers, what attempts have you made since that incident?  \nLingling: I don’t know what to do. I feel like the teachers already think I disrespect them, and they probably don’t want to talk to me. I don’t know if they’re angry because of my behavior that day. Before that, I was still as warm towards them as before, but sometimes I could sense their impatience. I just didn’t think too much about it. I only remembered what I did after hearing their comments, and then I didn’t dare to talk to her anymore; it seemed useless anyway.  \nMe: Why do you think she would be angry?  \nLingling: I think she might have misunderstood. I left halfway through her class; she might have thought I thought her class wasn’t good and that I just left because I was bored. She probably felt disrespected.  \nMe: Hmm. Everyone has a need for respect. How do you think you could have made her feel respected at that time?  \nLingling: Sigh, it’s too late to say anything now.  \nMe: Let's use the empty chair technique again to help you express what you want to say, okay?  \nLingling: Sure, I found that method quite useful last time.  \nMe: Imagine your teacher is sitting directly across from you; look at her and see her expression.  \nLingling: I feel like she doesn't want to see me; she seems a bit angry.  \nMe: Would you like to say something to her?  \nLingling: Teacher, it seems you've been unhappy with me recently. I know it’s because of what happened last time when I attended your class. My biggest flaw is that I often forget things. I intended to explain things to you after class, but I forgot. I truly didn't mean to disrespect you, nor did I think your teaching was poor. That day I had to go back to prepare my lesson materials for my next class, and without those materials, I really didn't know how to teach a class. I hope you can forgive me.  \nMe: Your teacher hears your sincere apology; do you think she will understand? Now, please switch to that chair and act as your teacher.  \nLingling as her teacher: I see. That day you just suddenly said you had to leave halfway through. I thought it was just an excuse for not wanting to listen to my class.  \nMe: Your teacher seems to have indeed misunderstood you. How do you feel about that? Please return to your own chair.  \nLingling: I feel much relieved after saying that. I'm not someone who can keep things to myself, and it feels uncomfortable to hold it in.  \nMe: Hmm, misunderstandings arise when both parties do not fully understand the causes and processes of events. If we communicate in a timely manner and state the truth, everyone can understand each other.  \nLingling: I understand now. I think sometimes I assume others know what I'm thinking, and I get lazy about saying it. In fact, everyone might not know at all. When conflicts arise, I also don’t understand why others are inexplicably angry. I think in the future I shouldn’t mind the trouble; I should clarify everything that needs to be said.  \nMe: Great, it seems you have a good understanding of the problems you face. Therefore, there’s no need for us to continue the consultation. I hope you will communicate more with the people around you in your life, as you mentioned, clarifying everything. I believe you will enjoy pleasant interactions with those around you."], "experience_and_reflection": "In reflecting on the two consultations with Lingling, it becomes evident that the process not only facilitated her immediate resolution of conflicts with her roommate and teacher but also served as a significant learning experience for both of us in understanding the complexities of interpersonal relationships and communication. The therapeutic journey highlighted the transformative power of empathy, self-awareness, and communication, which are crucial in navigating the interpersonal dynamics that Lingling faced.\n\nLingling's initial presentation was marked by a palpable sense of frustration and discomfort with her current life circumstances. She was struggling with transitioning from a familiar academic environment to a new setting, which included managing relationships with her roommate, teachers, and family. This transitional phase was challenging as it required her to adapt to new expectations and interpersonal dynamics, which were different from those she was accustomed to on campus. Her loud and casual manner during our first meeting hinted at an underlying tension and a need to assert herself amidst feelings of being unwelcomed and misunderstood.\n\nThe first consultation provided a foundational understanding of Lingling's interpersonal conflicts, particularly with her roommate. Through the use of the empty chair technique, she began to explore her assumptions and communication style. It was apparent that Lingling held some irrational beliefs, characterized by absolutism and a tendency to expect others to conform to her plans without engaging in open dialogue. This realization was pivotal as it allowed her to see the importance of timely and effective communication in resolving conflicts.\n\nThe empty chair technique was instrumental in facilitating this insight. By allowing Lingling to role-play both herself and her roommate, she could step outside her perspective and view the situation through her roommate's eyes. This exercise helped her understand that her plan for managing shared expenses, while logical to her, might not have been communicated clearly or considered the preferences of her roommates. It was an enlightening moment for Lingling, as she recognized the value of listening to others' opinions and the potential benefits of adapting her approach.\n\nThe resolution of the conflict with her roommate was a significant achievement. Lingling demonstrated courage and vulnerability by initiating a conversation with her roommate, which led to a more harmonious living arrangement. This experience underscored the importance of taking initiative in communication, even when there is fear of rejection or awkwardness. Lingling's success in this instance was not just about resolving the immediate conflict but about gaining confidence in her ability to handle interpersonal issues more effectively in the future.\n\nThe second consultation shifted focus to Lingling's experiences at her internship, where she encountered a similar pattern of miscommunication and misunderstanding with her teacher. This session reinforced the idea that communication is a skill that requires continual practice and mindfulness. Lingling's forgetfulness and the subsequent misunderstanding with her teacher highlighted how small lapses in communication could have larger implications on relationships and perceptions.\n\nHere again, the empty chair technique proved to be a valuable tool. It allowed Lingling to articulate her intentions and acknowledge her oversight, which helped her internalize the importance of addressing misunderstandings promptly. This exercise also facilitated a deeper emotional release for Lingling, enabling her to confront her fears of judgment and rejection. By imagining the dialogue with her teacher, she could mentally rehearse a constructive conversation that could potentially mend their relationship.\n\nThroughout these consultations, the therapeutic process emphasized the necessity of self-reflection and personal accountability in communication. Lingling learned that effective communication involves not only expressing one's own needs and perspectives but also actively listening and responding to others'. This understanding is crucial in fostering mutual respect and understanding in any relationship, whether with peers, family, or colleagues.\n\nAdditionally, the consultations highlighted the role of emotional regulation in communication. Lingling's initial approach to conflicts was often reactionary, driven by emotions of frustration and defensiveness. By engaging in the therapeutic process, she began to develop greater emotional awareness and regulation, allowing her to approach conflicts with a calmer and more rational mindset. This shift not only improved her interpersonal interactions but also contributed to her overall emotional well-being.\n\nReflecting on Lingling's journey, it is clear that the development of communication skills is an ongoing process that extends beyond the confines of therapy. Lingling's experiences serve as a reminder that interpersonal relationships are dynamic and require continuous effort and adaptation. The insights gained from these consultations will hopefully empower her to navigate future challenges with greater confidence and competence.\n\nFrom a clinical perspective, this case underscores the efficacy of the empty chair technique in addressing interpersonal conflicts and enhancing communication skills. The technique's ability to foster empathy and perspective-taking can lead to significant personal growth and emotional integration. It also highlights the importance of creating a safe and supportive therapeutic environment where clients feel comfortable exploring their thoughts and emotions.\n\nIn conclusion, the consultations with Lingling provided valuable lessons in the art of communication and the complexities of human relationships. Through guided self-reflection and experiential learning, Lingling was able to overcome her initial challenges and emerge with a deeper understanding of herself and her interactions with others. This case serves as a testament to the power of therapy in facilitating personal growth and fostering healthier, more fulfilling relationships.", "causes": "poor adaptation to new environments, expectation of unconditional obedience of others to one's plans, lack of communication styles.", "symptoms": "interpersonal conflicts, complaints, emotional exhaustion.", "treatment_process": "Identify irrational beliefs, apply empty chair technique to guide transpersonal thinking, encourage proactive communication and apologizing.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Interpersonal maladaptation, difficulties in emotional regulation, self-centered thinking patterns.", "treatment_effect": "Improve interpersonal relationship, enhance communication confidence, promote emotional health and self-growth."}

She insisted on scheduling a consultation for noon and even forced her husband, who had just gotten off work, to come along (one can feel the mother's strong will and insistence). As soon as they sat down, she couldn't wait to talk about her son. The mother describes her son as selfish, spoiled, self-centered, stubborn, and unruly. Her self-assessment is that she is strong-willed, has a strong need for control, does things her own way, and is self-centered. She believes that when her child was younger, he always knew to accommodate her and please her. She is extremely strict with the child and gives him no autonomy. For example, when the child plays with a skateboard in the square and is having fun in his own way, she thinks he is playing poorly, not doing the moves correctly, and embarrassing himself. She intervenes roughly and criticizes him, completely disregarding his feelings. In the father's eyes, the only advantage of the son is a good memory; he can pass English without much study. From elementary to middle school, the son's academic performance once made the father proud, but now the son has no merits in the father's eyes, let alone appreciation. From elementary to middle school, the son had excellent academic performance and was identified by the school as a key training target for a top high school, and he also served as class monitor. Later, in the second year of junior high, the son became fond of playing basketball. The mother said he mixed with a group of bad kids and learned to smoke. In the first year of junior high, the mother bought a tablet as a reward for the son's studies, but he gradually developed a liking for video games. This led to frequent conflicts between the couple and their child; they tried hitting and scolding him, and several phones were broken, but nothing worked, and the situation worsened. In the third year of junior high, the mother arranged for the son to transfer schools through the teacher to prevent him from being influenced by those \"bad kids.\" However, when it came time for the physical education exam, the son requested to return to his old school to take the test, but the mother refused. Ultimately, the son did not get into the top high school and only managed to enroll in an ordinary high school. After starting the first year of high school, the son entered a rebellious phase, and the parents continued their rough methods of hitting and scolding until the son admitted his mistakes and begged for forgiveness. However, since last year, the father no longer dared to hit the son because the son stopped dodging the blows, stopped begging for mercy, and even glared at the father in anger. The father, seeing his son almost the same height as himself, no longer dared to hit him! The father said his way of disciplining his son is just a replica of how his own father disciplined him. Later, the son became even more reckless with his phone usage and smoking. The mother gradually changed her attitude, no longer trying to control the son but instead trying to please him. However, the son felt that his mother’s kindness was just a means of control and was all pretended. As a result, communication within the family became less and less. The mother assessed her son as curious, fond of new things, kind-hearted, empathetic, and polite. At this point, the couple mentioned that their son is very well-behaved and polite at school and with his grandparents, caring about others. But at home, especially with them, he behaves like a different person, showing no manners at all? (What is the issue here? What kind of questioning approach should be used to provoke self-reflection from this couple?) This child has matured somewhat prematurely; when he was younger, he would appease his self-important mother, and by the age of fourteen or fifteen, he would appease his drunk father in the wild. When he returned home and spoke to his grandparents, he claimed it was all fake; he was genuinely afraid that his father, when drunk, would beat him to death in the fields, so these behaviors were just for show. Under this violent disciplinary model, the child learned to protect himself. In the wife's eyes, her husband is warm-hearted, soft-hearted, and just, caring for his wife, but he never communicates well with their son. The mother said both of them have personality flaws, which might be the main reason for their son's issues.", "V. Case Analysis: Children growing up in a home lacking equality, democracy, and freedom naturally lack self-control and constantly resist their parents through negative patterns. However, we cannot blame the parents too harshly, as they are also victims of their own families of origin, and we should not overly pathologize them. The son is very intelligent; he has learned to protect himself within this pathological disciplinary model, but this model is clearly abnormal. As the child grows older and becomes physically stronger, the struggle for control and counter-control between the child and the parents continues, but the initiative is increasingly shifting to the son. Currently, this couple feels helpless regarding their son and has come to seek assistance out of sheer desperation."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on this case, it becomes clear that the dynamics within the family are deeply entrenched in patterns that have been perpetuated over generations. The family's struggle with their son's school aversion is emblematic of a larger issue of control and autonomy within their relationships. At the outset of the consultation, we were faced with the mother's intense anxiety and the father's more subdued yet equally perplexed demeanor. They both sought a solution to their son's behavior, but their approach was rooted in a framework of coercion and control, a pattern that has been mirrored from their own upbringing.\n\nThe consultation began with an acute sense of urgency, driven by the mother's desperation to address her son's reluctance to attend school. In hindsight, a critical learning point is the importance of setting the stage for realistic expectations at the beginning of the consultation. This is especially crucial when dealing with clients who are in a heightened state of anxiety. Our initial failure to reaffirm specific goals contributed to the mother's feeling of disappointment at the end of the session. A more deliberate approach in outlining the consultation process and setting achievable goals could have provided a more structured framework for the session.\n\nDuring the consultation, the narrative shared by the parents revealed a complex web of family dynamics. The mother's self-admitted strong-willed nature and need for control have manifested in a parenting style that leaves little room for the son's autonomy. This controlling behavior, while perhaps well-intentioned, has inadvertently contributed to the son's rebellion and aversion to school. The father's admission of replicating his own father's disciplinary methods highlights a cycle of behavior that has been passed down through generations, underscoring the importance of addressing these deep-seated patterns within family therapy.\n\nThe consultation also illuminated the duality of the son's behavior; he presents as well-mannered and polite in school and with his grandparents, yet at home, he is resistant and challenging. This discrepancy suggests that the son has developed a coping mechanism to navigate the different expectations placed upon him. It is a testament to his intelligence and adaptability, yet also a cry for a more nurturing and understanding environment at home. The parents' inability to recognize his strengths and focus instead on his shortcomings further exacerbates the situation, leading to a breakdown in communication and trust.\n\nIn exploring the father's perception of his son, it became evident that the father's view is clouded by a rigid expectation of academic success, which the son once fulfilled but now struggles to meet. This shift in perception, from pride to disappointment, reflects the father's own unmet expectations and possibly his unresolved issues from his upbringing. The consultation provided a moment of breakthrough when the mother was able to articulate her husband's strengths, leading to a visible change in his demeanor. This moment highlighted the potential for positive reinforcement and acknowledgment to transform relationships.\n\nA pivotal aspect of this consultation was the realization that the son's use of school as a bargaining tool is a reflection of the power dynamics at play. The father aptly noted that the son leverages what he perceives as important to his mother—his education—to exert control. This insight is crucial, as it reveals the son's attempt to reclaim some sense of agency within an environment where he feels largely powerless. Addressing this dynamic requires a shift from a control-based approach to one that fosters communication, mutual respect, and understanding.\n\nPostmodern thought, with its emphasis on equality, democracy, and freedom, provides a valuable lens through which to view this case. It challenges us as clinicians to help families break free from the chains of their own making, encouraging a move towards a more egalitarian and open family structure. In doing so, we honor the principles of self-determination and autonomy, allowing each family member to become the master of their own life.\n\nThe art of psychological counseling lies in navigating these complex family dynamics with sensitivity and insight. Language plays a critical role in this process, as it is through dialogue that we engage in the co-creation of a new family narrative. The consultation offered a glimpse into the possibility of change, yet also underscored the challenges inherent in altering entrenched patterns of behavior.\n\nThe feedback received post-consultation from the mother, although initially marked by disappointment, later reflected a degree of awareness and reflection. This suggests that even when immediate outcomes are not apparent, the seeds of change may have been planted. The homework assigned, though simple, served as a tool for further introspection and emotional processing, highlighting the ongoing nature of therapeutic work.\n\nAs we consider the differences in approach required for visitors seeking to resolve their own issues versus those seeking to help others, it becomes apparent that each requires a tailored strategy. For the former, the focus is on empowering the individual to navigate their own challenges, while for the latter, the emphasis is on equipping them with the skills to support and facilitate change in others.\n\nUltimately, this case serves as a reminder of the power of psychological counseling to illuminate hidden dynamics and foster growth, even in the face of deeply rooted challenges. It is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the potential for transformation when individuals are given the space and support to explore their own narratives.", "causes": "Parents' own upbringing, the formation of a controlling parenting style, the lack of equality, democracy and freedom in the family, and the long-term suppression of the child.", "symptoms": "Son's truancy, rebelliousness, lack of communication with parents, parents' anxiety and helplessness.", "treatment_process": "Through structured family therapy, we explored the dynamics of family relationships, guided the parents to reflect on their own behavior and intergenerational inheritance patterns, and adjusted their parenting styles.", "characteristics_of_illness": "The son's behavior was two-fold:he resisted challenges at home, but was well-behaved and polite outside; the parents' evaluation of the child was one-sided, and the family's communication and trust collapsed.", "treatment_effect": "No significant change was achieved in the short term, but the seeds of change were sown, and the mother's awareness and reflection were facilitated, highlighting the continuity of the Treatment work."}
{"id": 182, "case_description": ["The client is 37 years old, married, and reports having a good relationship with their parents, with no conflicts. Both the original family and the current family situation are good, and they work hard themselves (Note: \"good\" and \"any\" can sometimes serve as a shield, preventing us from seeing the facts and the truth. It is both a protection and a defense.). The visitor describes experiencing uncontrollable symptoms: during interactions with others, they find themselves zoning out while simultaneously forcing themselves to focus on the other person's mouth or their own (the more they try to control it, the less control they have), which causes them significant distress, affecting their emotions and work, leading them to seek consultation. This has been ongoing for about two years, and it has recently worsened."], "consultation_process": ["Prologue: A metaphor: There is a wall that the counselor cannot climb over, and neither can the client. However, standing on the counselor's shoulders, the client gets over it. In front of a mirror, you can gradually see everything about yourself. However, any material, quantifiable existence cannot serve as such a mirror; only a truly existing soul can. A good counselor is such a mirror. I wish to be such a counselor. The client is 37 years old, married, and reports having a good relationship with his parents, with no conflicts; both his family of origin and current family situations are good, and he works hard. (Note: \"Good\" and \"any\" can sometimes serve as shields that prevent us from seeing the facts and the truth. They provide protection but also serve as a defense.) The client describes experiencing uncontrollable symptoms: during conversations, he tends to zone out while constantly forcing himself to pay attention to either the other person's mouth or his own (the more he tries to control it, the more out of control it becomes), which causes him great distress, affecting his emotions and work, leading him to seek counseling. This has been ongoing for about two years, and it has recently worsened. \"My confidence has decreased,\" he initially assesses his symptoms, \"actually, it's a lack of confidence; the main issue is that I feel very unnatural when speaking with others, constantly focusing on my own mouth, unable to express freely.\" \"Decreased\" indicates that it was once very high; behind the shift in focus, there must be unfulfilled needs; \"express freely\" actually represents a pursuit of perfection, which still causes suffering: sometimes, suffering serves as a way to punish oneself; without punishment, guilt has no place to settle. And the word \"indulge\" perhaps carries deeper meaning. I use postmodern psychological techniques: Ericksonian hypnosis as a background, combined with energy psychology, intention dialogue, and NLP's sensory elements to quickly and effectively alleviate symptoms. Then, we touch upon the core beliefs behind the symptoms, either correcting or rebuilding them. Through relaxation and free association, the client mentions that he has recently experienced two job changes that did not lead to the expected promotions, which worsened the symptoms (just worsened). Further tracing back, around the age of 15 during adolescence, he had similar symptoms, but they lasted only a short time, less than two months (specific reasons are unclear: the essence of repression is the unwillingness to face deep pain). Then, through linking to feelings (feelings have no timeline and can directly reach the original memory), the client recalls an investment he made with a close friend, driven by youthful ambition, which led him to use all his funds and even persuade his parents to invest their life savings. Ultimately, it failed, leaving him feeling he had disappointed his parents and filled with guilt: \"On one hand, it was my good buddy, so I couldn't blame him; on the other hand, my parents' hard-earned money (a lot) went down the drain, yet I had no opportunity to express my inner guilt, which was a tremendous torment.\" \"Did all the investors lose money?\" \"He lost a lot too,\" he said while touching his mouth. \"Did your father ever blame you?\" I continued asking. \"No, never,\" he replied. \"Did you ever try to communicate?\" \"No.\" Guilt is a very depleting energy; if it cannot be expressed and is not allowed to be seen (the client reports having never confided in anyone), such conflict (energy needing an outlet) gets transferred, and the client focuses on his mouth: unable to express, yet feels compelled to contain it tightly—what a direct symbolic meaning. The blockage of energy must find an outlet; \"where there is oppression, there is resistance.\" This applies to society and the body. Physical symptoms are like dreams, one being the messenger of emotion (energy) and the other the messenger of the subconscious, all depending on how we interpret them. From another perspective, the deeper a person understands suffering, the deeper their understanding of life and love may be (possibly). Thus, the attitude towards events, emotions, and feelings, and how to interpret them, is more important. Childhood memories can be temporarily set aside, but it must be acknowledged that these matters are interconnected (the continuity of the timeline, accumulation, eruption), and while the failure in job promotion is a recent event, it merely exacerbated the symptoms; it is the last straw, not the initial instigator. A man who wishes to make his father proud and uphold family honor experiences dual failures in investment and career, which become an unbearable shame and secret he cannot face. Even secrets need to be illuminated and seen. At least by ourselves. With the client's consent (all conflicts are doors and windows, opportunities and possibilities), after simple breathing relaxation, we begin a dialogue with the inner self: \"I hope to gain your support and help so that I can better understand the motivations and reasons behind these symptoms, is that okay?\" When he sends out such an invitation, he cannot see the inner child and is unwilling to reveal it. \"He is willing to support you, isn't he? Even if he is reluctant to show himself.\" Then more imagery: a small wooden house that does not wish to have a fence, sitting alone in a desolate wilderness; around the house, there is only green grass, the door is wooden, and the interior is simply furnished. \"It's a bit lonely and desolate,\" he said. \"Actually, there is a basement next to the door; would you like to take a look?\" \"No, I wouldn't,\" he replied after a moment of silence. \"I'm a bit scared and panicked.\" \"I will stay with you as long as you wish; you can also tell me your feelings at any time or stop.\" Using imagery dialogue, we gradually relieve emotions, the canvas slowly reopens, becoming rich and three-dimensional: the wooden house transforms into a two-story villa, the interior becomes warm, cozy, and safe, then we enter the basement, confronting another weary self, willing to accompany, dialogue, reconcile, integrate, and heal. Then, with a renewed self, we walk out of the darkness and into a new world. Then I invite the taciturn father to come forward. \"What would you like to say to your father?\" I guide, \"right here and now.\" \"Actually,\" he stammers, choosing this phrase, and at this moment, his language has become fluent; when he previously repeated my words, he often changed phrases or order. Just as he said, the expressive barrier has effectively lifted. \"Actually, I feel very guilty,\" he continues, speaking many, many words, and then tears stream down his face. Face to face (even if imagined), he has said everything that needed to be said, expressed all that needed to be expressed; emotions are relieved, pressure is released, and internal conflicts are seen, understood, transformed, and begin to flow: at that moment, when love can be expressed, the rigid relationship begins to gain warmth. In that instant, the person also becomes transparent. Finding the repeating story script of each client, uncovering the internal logic of the story (the logic may not be reasonable, but it is certainly the client’s own logic, because psychology is phenomenology, not science), we can shift perspectives and dimensions, thus changing the colors, warmth, and feelings behind the scene in the client's heart. If the client is willing to express their past (story) more authentically and sincerely and is willing to grow for a better self, the effect will naturally be different. Note: Recommendations and assignments: First, I hope to continue with case consultations to resolve more emotional management patterns and mental models for growth; second, I hope to clearly understand several principles of our communication in today's case: First, accept and allow yourself to have any emotions, thoughts, or feelings; these are all true expressions and representations of our present moment; we only need to see them unless we have committed immoral or illegal acts; otherwise, all our thoughts and feelings are limited to ourselves, irrelevant to others, and do not require condemnation or guilt. Third, continuous growth and awareness, improving a little bit every day, is something both you and all of us can achieve."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on this case, I am struck by the complex interplay of emotions, experiences, and unconscious processes that have shaped the client's current struggles. The journey from understanding the surface symptoms to uncovering the deeper emotional needs has been enlightening and has provided profound insights into the therapeutic process. Initially, the client's symptoms appeared to be rooted in a lack of confidence, manifesting as a compulsion to focus on his mouth during conversations—a symbolic representation of an inability to express freely. This fixation suggests an internal struggle between the desire to articulate thoughts and the fear of expressing something unspeakable or shameful. The more he tried to control this behavior, the more out of control it became, highlighting the paradox of repression.\n\nThe discovery of unfulfilled needs behind these symptoms was a pivotal moment. It became apparent that the client's pursuit of perfection, and the self-punishment associated with failing to achieve it, were significant contributors to his distress. Perfectionism often serves as a defense mechanism, an attempt to ward off feelings of inadequacy or guilt. In this case, the client's guilt from past failures seemed to fuel this pursuit, creating a cycle of suffering that he could not escape. The notion of punishment as a means to manage guilt is a common theme in psychotherapy, as guilt, when left unaddressed, can lead to destructive behaviors that serve to reinforce one's sense of unworthiness.\n\nThrough the use of Ericksonian hypnosis, NLP, and imagery dialogue, we were able to delve deeper into the client's psyche, uncovering core beliefs that were at the root of his symptoms. The relaxation techniques allowed the client to access memories and emotions that had been suppressed, providing a pathway to understanding his internal conflicts. His history of job changes and the failure of an investment, which involved not only his own savings but those of his parents, emerged as critical events that exacerbated his symptoms. These experiences were not just failures in a practical sense; they were failures that had deep emotional repercussions, tied to his identity and self-worth.\n\nThe investment failure, in particular, seemed to be a significant source of guilt and shame. The client had never communicated his feelings about this event, leaving him isolated with his emotions. Guilt is a powerful emotion that can deplete one's energy and drive, leading to symptoms that are both psychological and physical. In this case, the client's focus on his mouth during conversations was a direct symbolic representation of his struggle to contain these unexpressed feelings. By holding onto these emotions without an outlet, the client was forced to internalize his conflict, leading to the physical manifestation of his distress.\n\nThe therapeutic process allowed us to explore these emotions through imagery dialogue, a technique that facilitates communication with the subconscious. The imagery of a small wooden house, isolated and desolate, mirrored the client's emotional state. His reluctance to explore the basement of this house—symbolizing deeper, hidden emotions—highlighted his fear of confronting painful memories. Yet, through gradual engagement and support, the imagery transformed, reflecting a shift in his internal landscape. The transformation of the wooden house into a villa, warm and inviting, symbolized the client's growing comfort with his emotions and the beginning of healing.\n\nThe dialogue with the inner self and the imagined conversation with his father were crucial in releasing pent-up emotions and resolving internal conflicts. The ability to express guilt and seek forgiveness, even in an imagined scenario, provided the client with relief and a sense of closure. This process of reconciliation, both internal and external, allowed the client to confront and integrate aspects of his identity that he had previously rejected. It underscored the importance of expression in healing, as unspoken emotions can create barriers that hinder personal growth and emotional well-being.\n\nOne of the most profound realizations in this case was the understanding of the client's internal logic—the unique narrative he had constructed around his experiences. Psychology, as a study of phenomenology, emphasizes the subjective reality of each individual. The client's story, though it may not be logical or reasonable by external standards, is his truth, shaped by his experiences and emotions. By identifying this narrative, we can shift perspectives and dimensions, altering the emotional colors and temperature of his inner world. This change in perspective is not about imposing a new reality but about helping the client see his story in a new light, freeing him from the constraints of past interpretations.\n\nThe role of love, parenting education, and personal growth in this process cannot be overstated. The client's desire to make his father proud and uphold family honor was a driving force behind his actions, yet it also created a burden of guilt when he perceived himself as failing. Addressing these deep-seated motivations required a nuanced approach, acknowledging the impact of familial expectations and the quest for validation. The imagined dialogue with his father served as a conduit for expressing these complex emotions, allowing for a re-evaluation of his relationship with his parents and his own self-worth.\n\nAs clinicians, it is our responsibility to guide clients through their emotional landscapes, helping them navigate the intricacies of their internal worlds. This case highlights the importance of a holistic approach that integrates various therapeutic techniques to address both surface symptoms and deeper emotional needs. By fostering an environment of acceptance and understanding, we can empower clients to embrace their emotions, thoughts, and feelings as true expressions of their present selves. This acceptance is the first step toward healing, allowing clients to shed the burden of guilt and shame and move toward a more authentic and fulfilling existence.\n\nContinuous growth and awareness are essential components of this journey. Encouraging clients to improve incrementally, while recognizing their progress, can instill a sense of hope and possibility. This case has reinforced the value of patience and empathy in therapy, as each step forward, no matter how small, contributes to the client's overall well-being. By embracing the complexities of human emotions and experiences, we can help clients achieve a deeper understanding of themselves, fostering resilience and a renewed sense of purpose. Ultimately, the therapeutic process is a partnership, a collaborative effort to explore, understand, and transform the narratives that shape our lives.", "causes": "Internalization of unexpressed guilt over failed investments in earlier years, creating internal conflict, exacerbated by recent failure to get a promotion at work.", "symptoms": "suspected obsessive-compulsive disorder", "treatment_process": "using Ericksonian hypnosis, NLP, imaginative dialog and other techniques, exploring the client's psychological world in depth, and engaging in imaginative dialog with the inner self and the father.", "characteristics_of_illness": "wandering off during interactions with others, forced to focus on the other person or his own mouth, mood and work affected. .

{"id": 183, "case_description": ["Miss Ren, 28 years old, with a bachelor's degree in accounting, has lived for a long time in a state of feeling monitored by others, suffering immensely, with a \"split personality\" history of 10 years."], "consultation_process": ["Miss Ren comes from a beautiful island town. Although she often describes herself as having a bad temper and being anxious, she appears quite dignified and calm, not like many patients with schizophrenia who are either manic or withdrawn. She stumbled upon our website unconsciously and scheduled a treatment the next day. She wants to understand the reasons behind her first experience of schizophrenia ten years ago when she was 18, the reasons for the prolonged monitoring of her mental state by others over the past decade, the relationships she has with two men in her consciousness, and which of them will ultimately die! According to general social medical norms, this would be classified as a case of delusional schizophrenia. However, my theory differs, so I took on the task of helping her resolve her issues.", "First, I explained Dr. Cao's psychological structure model and found that she has a very good understanding, surpassing that of the general public. Then I conducted a sensitivity test and found that it was only around level one, indicating obvious paranoid personality traits, with suspicion towards everything and a tendency towards obsessive thinking, which also aligns well with her accounting profession (based on my clinical experience, accountants generally exhibit obsessive tendencies, which is considered a normal occupational hazard). According to general hypnosis theory, such a low sensitivity would not yield good hypnotic effects, but I secretly felt relieved, as it seemed I already had an answer: she might be a \"pseudopsychotic\"! (Readers should not generalize this understanding.)", "Entering hypnosis to address the core issue, back to when I was 18: the first episode of psychosis occurred without any psychological disorders or special events. I went to the city hospital for treatment, which was attributed to occasional hallucinations and delusions. After a week of medication, the symptoms disappeared. Based on experience, I suspect it may have been caused by anxiety and stress before the college entrance examination. (Many students who feel significant academic pressure may occasionally experience hallucinations.)", "Continuing to trace the second onset of illness, it was during her sophomore year in college when she began to \"fall in love.\" In her mind, there were two boys from the same family pursuing her at the same time, which left her confused and unable to choose. As a result, she often felt that those two boys were monitoring her thoughts and actions. She frequently experienced red light spots shining in her mind, indicating that those family members were watching her! Moreover, since she had two boys dating her in her thoughts, they both insulted her, calling her a \"white bone spirit\" and shameless! They wanted to enter her mind to monitor her and see if she was being unfaithful. Additionally, they had the ability to sneak a peek at her diary and follow her whereabouts! Later on, many things happened... one of the boys died... By her junior year, her symptoms flared up, and she returned home to recuperate. During this time, she even truly heard those family members cursing her: \"Let her die quickly...\" So, I asked her if she had seen these people. She replied, \"No,\" as all her experiences were in her brain consciousness, and she firmly believed in them! Isn't that extreme mental illness?! No, I believe her brain must have been subjected to some improper suggestions (which was confirmed during subsequent treatment).", "Of course, after the medication treatment, she quickly recovered, returned to school, and after graduating from university, she was assigned to a good company as an accountant. She dared not think about men (dating), as whenever she thought about dating (men), the people from that family would appear in her mind, saying, \"We are here to test you. You are a temptress; being too beautiful will attract men, how shameless! We will make you pay for this...\" and other intimidating and controlling words. There was even one time when she woke up early and found a shallow burn scar on her hand (I believe this might be a psychosomatic response, a physiological trace created by her subconscious! For theories related to this, please come and learn in our courses). She even found cigarette ashes (some kind of controlling drug) in the alcohol she had consumed... After another episode, she took medication, rested, and returned to normal after six months before going back to work. Thus, she no longer thought about boys and worked for four years without anything happening. Recently, as she got older and considered starting a family, the evil family members in her mind came again to control and intimidate her. She couldn't endure it, suffering from severe headaches, and came to me for help, trying to find the reasons and methods for a cure on a spiritual level.", "I was surprised to see her logical thinking being rigorous and her behavior appropriate, yet I couldn't connect her to schizophrenia (I trust my subconscious intuition). I began to \"overanalyze\" the details about her, trying to find some clues. The details revealed something: I noticed she wore multiple strands of Buddhist prayer beads on her hands. So, setting aside my questions, I talked to her extensively about Buddhism and discovered that she had many years of experience in practicing Buddhism, to the point of superstition. During meditation, she claimed to be impervious to malevolent spirits! Her mind was like a lotus flower or that of a child, and she said she could open her heavenly eye to see benevolent male immortals. In her daily life, she strictly adhered to the laws of cause and effect, meticulously followed Buddhist precepts, opposed unclear gender roles in receiving teachings, and was strictly confined by traditional moral values, upholding an extraordinarily stringent moral standard! She believed in the soul and reincarnation, had sought help from \"gods\" (monks) to exorcise spirits (her illness), and had also requested blessings from masters (tantric monks). She had done all this, yet it seemed ineffective. I began to understand a bit more and felt a quiet joy, as if I saw a word emerging in my higher subconscious: \"sex\"—the source of life, the greatest power! It seemed something strange was happening within her: her split personality was blocking her legitimate desires.", "So, she is a virgin, but where are the inner obstacles (injuries)? The age regression results were still fruitless, so she immediately decided to use hypnosis to explore issues related to her family of origin. The answers were astonishingly and perfectly revealed: they stemmed from her mother's tragic experiences and her own traumatic memories during pregnancy. It turns out that her mother did not want her father, but her father raped her mother. Her mother was a traditional woman bound by the norms of society, and reluctantly and shamefully married her father. At that time, her mother did not want this child, so she desperately drank alcohol and beat her abdomen with her fists, trying to abort the pregnancy herself (this behavior obviously severely affected the baby's nervous system and brain development, causing painful and distorted memories in the fetus's subconscious mind)... However, fate did not extinguish her; she was born into the world filled with pain, grievance, and physical and mental harm. Fortunately, her mind and body were still healthy, just like anyone else. But when she turned 18 and began to experience the stirrings of youth and longing for the opposite sex, the unbearable pain from her inner life experiences made it impossible for her to face normal sexuality and pursuit! The strict moral constraints and the restless drive of life tore her world apart, and it was inevitable that she developed \"split personality,\" stemming from the unresolved inner pain."], "experience_and_reflection": "Since the reason has been found, the hypnosis has activated the case's inner wisdom, adjusted cognition, and accepted all the pain and experiences of life. The soul has been forgiven, healed, and transcended, and all the illusions created by the subconscious are now far away. The body and mind have become tranquil and relaxed, naturally joyful, no longer falling ill and needing medication. Before leaving my clinic, she removed the three different Bodhisattvas hanging from her neck (moral shackles from different sects), the life-saving rope around her ankle (ignorant superstition), and the multiple strands of prayer beads on her hand (misguided self-suggestion). The inner life wisdom and power activated by hypnosis are incomparable to medication. The experience is truly profound.\n\nReflecting on this case, I am struck by the intricacies of Miss Ren's psychological landscape and the profound transformation she underwent. Schizophrenia, often viewed through the lens of persistent delusions and hallucinations, presented uniquely in Miss Ren's life. It was less a fragmented experience of reality and more a deeply intertwined narrative of personal, cultural, and existential conflicts. Her initial psychotic episodes, perceived as schizophrenia, were indeed manifestations of unresolved internal struggles, compounded by the societal and familial pressures she experienced from a young age.\n\nThe complexity of Miss Ren's condition required a therapeutic approach that transcended traditional psychiatric treatment. Hypnotherapy, in this context, served as a bridge between the conscious and subconscious realms, allowing Miss Ren to access the core of her psychic distress. This method enabled her to unravel the deeply ingrained narratives that had governed her life and facilitated a reorientation of her self-perception and worldview. Through hypnosis, we accessed memories and emotions that were otherwise inaccessible, providing a pathway for Miss Ren to confront and process her trauma.\n\nA key revelation in Miss Ren's treatment was the discovery of the origin of her internal conflicts. Her mother's traumatic experiences during pregnancy and the subsequent impact on Miss Ren's fetal development created a foundation of psychological turmoil. This early exposure to violence and rejection became imprinted in her subconscious, influencing her perception of relationships and self-worth. The act of hypnosis allowed us to revisit these formative moments, offering Miss Ren a chance to reinterpret and heal these memories from a place of safety and understanding.\n\nIn exploring Miss Ren's belief systems, it became evident that her adherence to strict moral codes and spiritual practices, while initially perceived as coping mechanisms, were in fact amplifying her internal discord. Her involvement with various religious sects, although intended to provide solace, instead acted as moral shackles that constrained her authentic self. The removal of these symbols—Bodhisattvas, life-saving ropes, and prayer beads—was a symbolic act of liberation, marking the beginning of her journey towards self-acceptance and healing.\n\nThe role of cultural and societal influences in shaping Miss Ren's psychological profile cannot be understated. Growing up in a traditional environment, she internalized rigid expectations of gender roles and moral behavior, which clashed with her natural desires and aspirations. Her struggle to reconcile these opposing forces manifested as the \"split personality\" she experienced, a defense mechanism against the perceived threat of her own desires. Through therapy, Miss Ren learned to embrace her sexuality and individuality, acknowledging these aspects as integral components of her identity rather than sources of shame.\n\nThe concept of pseudopsychosis emerged as a pivotal understanding in Miss Ren's case. Her symptoms, while resembling those of schizophrenia, were not rooted in a fundamental disconnection from reality but rather in a profound internal conflict. This distinction was crucial in guiding the therapeutic approach, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of her experiences. By addressing the underlying psychological factors, rather than merely treating the symptoms, we facilitated a more sustainable and authentic recovery.\n\nThroughout the therapeutic process, the activation of Miss Ren's inner wisdom was a testament to the power of self-awareness and introspection. As she delved into her subconscious, she uncovered a wellspring of resilience and insight, enabling her to reframe her narrative and embrace a new sense of agency. This transformation was not merely a cessation of symptoms but a profound shift in her relationship with herself and the world around her.\n\nThe Tao Te Ching passage that came to mind during this journey encapsulates the essence of Miss Ren's transformation. The notion of acting without action, of embracing substance over superficiality, resonates deeply with the therapeutic process. Miss Ren's journey was one of peeling back layers of societal and self-imposed expectations to reveal her true self. This process of letting go, of discarding the non-essential, allowed her to cultivate a life grounded in authenticity and inner peace.\n\nAs I reflect on Miss Ren's case, I am reminded of the delicate interplay between mind, body, and spirit in the healing process. Her journey underscores the importance of a holistic approach to mental health, one that honors the complexity of the human experience and acknowledges the interconnectedness of psychological, cultural, and existential factors. The insights gained from this case have deepened my understanding of schizophrenia and expanded my perspective on therapeutic interventions, reaffirming the potential for transformation when we align with the innate wisdom and resilience within each individual.\n\nIn conclusion, Miss Ren's story is a powerful reminder of the capacity for healing and growth inherent in every individual. Her journey from a place of fear and fragmentation to one of wholeness and empowerment serves as an inspiration, highlighting the transformative potential of therapy when approached with empathy, curiosity, and an open mind. As clinicians, it is our responsibility to create a safe and supportive space for such transformations to occur, facilitating the emergence of our clients' authentic selves and empowering them to navigate the complexities of life with grace and resilience.", "causes": "Rape and violence suffered by Ms. Ren's mother during pregnancy and trauma suffered by Ms. Ren herself during pregnancy.", "symptoms": "Delusional schizophrenia with paranoid personality traits.", "treatment_process": "Hypnotherapy was used to activate Ms. Ren's inner wisdom, adjust her cognition and make her accept the pain and experiences in her life, thus promoting her recovery.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Ms. Ren suffers from delusions of being watched, schizophrenia and paranoid personality traits, often feeling watched and threatened by others, and even experiencing hallucinations and hallucinations.", "treatment_effect": "After treatment, Ms. Ren regained peace of mind and body, was no longer sick and did not need medication, was free from religious constraints, and realized self-acceptance and healing."}

I've always cared about his opinion of me since I was little.", "Teacher Li: Oh, is he your uncle?", "Visitor: No. I want to push myself to go out and interact with people more, but now when I go out, my mind goes blank. Sometimes I can't even keep up with the conversation. I used to be very quick-witted; before you finished your sentence, I would already know what you were going to say next. But now, when I interact with people, I get nervous, and when I'm nervous, my mind goes blank. Especially when I'm interacting with people who are at a higher level than me or who are more powerful, I become even more nervous!", "Teacher Li: Oh, is there more? Can you say a bit more?", "Visitor: I don't know how to say it, why don't you ask instead!", "Teacher Li: What kind of person is your uncle?", "Visitor: The person I admire!", "Teacher Li: What makes you admire him so much?", "Visitor: He is very capable, whether in speaking or doing things. Ten years ago, when I was at my lowest point, everyone distanced themselves from me, but he encouraged and supported me, helping me to come out of it! I care a lot about his opinion of me, and I feel very unnatural in front of him.", "Teacher Li: How can you say that ten years ago was the lowest point in your life? Can you elaborate on that?", "Visitor: Ten years ago, I did some foolish things because I was young and didn't know better!", "Teacher Li: Oh!", "Visitor: Aren't you going to ask me what I did? Are you afraid of hurting me, or afraid of embarrassing me?", "Teacher Li: I want to respect your thoughts. If you are willing to share, you can speak; if you are not willing to say, then let's change the topic. How does that sound?", "Visitor: Hmm, go ahead and ask?", "Teacher Li: Are you still willing to continue discussing this topic?", "Visitor: Okay. Ten years ago, I developed some bad habits after associating with certain people in society. At that time, everyone kept their distance from me, but he was the only one who encouraged me. I didn't leave my house for half a year, and it was him who came to chat with me every day and took me out for drinks. He encouraged me to spend more time with my brother at home, and gradually I started to come out of it! I really admire his ability to get things done and the way he speaks, and it was he who helped me stand up again. So I care a lot about his opinion of me! Since last year, I felt inflated and thought others were not as good as me. I spoke very bluntly! I also knew that this could hurt people. At that time, I was just feeling good about myself, and my arrogance didn't subside. Slowly, I also felt that he had opinions about me.", "Teacher Li: How did you notice that he has an opinion about you?", "Visitor: My uncle is very close to my two brothers. They almost always drink tea together and talk about other people's business. I've participated a few times, and it's always about criticizing someone and discussing their faults. I'm afraid that when I'm not around, they will talk about me in the same way! The story goes back to last year. I have an older cousin whose business hasn't been doing well in the past two years. He owes the bank hundreds of thousands in loans, and he has to make repayments every March, then take out new loans. The annual interest is over 20,000. During one dinner, I suggested that since we have so many brothers in the family, each of us should contribute 20,000 to help him pay off his loans. Even if we just pay off half, it would reduce the interest he has to pay each year. The older brother who owes money wasn't present, and I just proposed that we do this. At that time, my uncle didn't respond, but the two older brothers at the table said to me, \"Wow, you really have a sense of family, huh? Are you the savior?\" I just wanted to help my older brother have a better time, so I suggested everyone lend him a hand! But the people at the table opposed it and somewhat mocked me, implying: \"You're just showing off!\"", "Teacher Li: What happened next?", "Visitor: Since that time, I feel distant from them. Plus, this year's business isn't as good as last year's, so during this time, as I started to mention to you, I've been feeling very insecure and withdrawn! Did I express myself clearly?", "Teacher Li: Okay, may I ask what your uncle's attitude towards you is?", "Visitor: Standing on their side, even though they haven't made a statement, I can tell.", "Teacher Li: How did you figure it out?", "Visitor: I'm not stupid. How can you tell which side he stands on? After these few encounters, it's really unnatural to be with my uncle, so I've been trying to avoid being together! Is there anything else you need to know?", "Teacher Li: I want to ask, you said that there was a period last year when you were in pretty good shape?", "Visitor: Well, just after the New Year last year, the business competition was strong, and at that time, everything was going well, and I was very confident! Based on this understanding, can you share your thoughts? Help me summarize how I should adjust?", "Teacher Li: Why do I feel that your mood changes are closely related to the ups and downs of your business? Are there any other things that might affect your mood?", "Visitor: I think that's true! When business is good, everything feels uplifting, but when it's not, the mood isn't great. I've thought: since my relationships aren't good, I should earn more money to make up for it. Once I have money, relationships will come! It's wrong for me to think this way, isn't it?", "Teacher Li: Oh, having money can compensate for interpersonal relationships. What other benefits do you think having money will bring you? Or how do you think this is wrong? Is it okay to ask this? If you feel uncomfortable, please let me know!", "Visitor: No matter how rich you are, if you always act arrogant, thinking you're the best, others won't want to approach you. You're just too arrogant. Now I feel that interpersonal relationships have little to do with money; maybe there is some connection, but it's minimal. It's fine, I'm not uncomfortable now! In the first two years, I thought that as long as I had money, everything would be okay! Now I realize that my previous thoughts were wrong!", "Teacher Li: Oh, I see!", "Visitor: Am I being a bit confusing? I hope you can understand!", "Teacher Li: No, it's quite good. Can you continue?", "Visitor: To help you understand me better, I have not been an easy child since I was little, often causing worry for the adults. I dropped out of school at around twelve or thirteen, played for two years, and then helped my dad with his business. By the time I was fifteen, I was driving myself and using several thousand yuan to purchase goods! At that time, my dad wasn't exactly proud, but he was quite satisfied. Others also said I was capable. Then I got involved with some troubled youths, and as I mentioned earlier, I spent half a year not leaving the house. My uncle helped me get through that period. Now, in my current state, I've realized that the more I live, the more I become like the person I despise!", "Teacher Li: What kind of person do you mean by someone you dislike?", "Visitor: Arrogant, pretentious, impetuous, unstable, overly concerned about appearances! It's almost 2:30, based on this understanding, could you help me summarize?", "Teacher Li: Alright, don't worry!", "Visitor: Share your thoughts; it's okay if it's not comprehensive, as time is limited after all.", "Teacher Li: May I ask what your ideal personality is like?", "Visitor: Sociable, humorous, and can give people a natural, unpretentious feeling!", "Teacher Li: Okay, in your past life, have you ever experienced this kind of state?", "Visitor: Yes, I have!", "Teacher Li: Can you tell me when it is?", "Visitor: Ten years ago, I had this personality, very cheerful and popular wherever I went. Has my condition been good or bad over the years?", "Teacher Li: I noticed that these two states of yours are like two different personalities, and the differences are particularly large!", "Visitor: Now, even just a look from someone else or an unintentional remark can make me wonder: what does this mean? Is it directed at me? In the past, I was very resolute; whatever others said, as long as I felt it was right, I would stick to it. Now, a single word from someone else can shake my thoughts. Am I experiencing a split personality?", "Teacher Li: Where did you learn these terms?", "Visitor: I saw it online!", "Teacher Li: Very interesting!", "Visitor: When I'm not feeling well, I stay at home and go online to see which symptoms are similar to mine, and then I compare them!", "Teacher Li: After comparing, do you just fit yourself into a category and label yourself?", "Visitor: Sometimes, because it sounds very similar!", "Teacher Li: Do you think this approach is helpful for your condition?", "Visitor: I know this isn't very accurate, just like fortune-telling; people tend to interpret things in a way that suits them. This approach doesn't help and instead makes me doubt if I have some illness!", "Teacher Li: Could this make your condition worse, intensifying your worries and anxiety?", "Visitor: Hmm!", "Teacher Li: Alright, may I ask how you feel in your heart during this one and a half hour conversation?", "Visitor: I don't feel uncomfortable, but I want to know if there's something wrong with me, or what the problem might be. How can I adjust my mindset?", "Teacher Li: If I say you have an illness, or if I say you don't have an illness, how would these two statements affect your mindset differently?", "Visitor: I think I will follow the direction you mentioned!", "Teacher Li: Thank you very much for your trust!", "Visitor: I want to hear your encouraging words, and then I'll slowly adjust myself!", "Teacher Li: Alright, then I'll share my thoughts and feelings during this conversation, okay?", "Visitor: Hmm!", "Teacher Li: I think you are a very perceptive person who is good at reflecting. Even when you feel uncomfortable inside, you continue to adjust yourself, and you are very capable. For example, you are aware of the relationship between interpersonal connections and money, and you experience changes as you talk! However, I believe you still need understanding and support from others. Deep down, there is a force within you that aspires to rise and do good. As long as you receive respect, understanding, and support from others, this force will grow rapidly!", "Visitor: That's right! What I need is affirmation, especially from the people I care about!", "Teacher Li: For example, your suggestion to have everyone contribute money to help your brother in difficulty repay his debts shows me your strength of kindness and positivity!", "Visitor: But they disagreed and even mocked me a bit. Later, I thought maybe they weren't wrong; everyone has their own struggles!", "Teacher Li: When the positive and uplifting force of this phenomenon grows strong enough, you will become very confident, and your mental outlook will undergo a significant change!", "Visitor: Exactly!", "Teacher Li: A person cannot expect to be understood by everyone!", "Visitor: I feel like I'm very extreme too: overflowing with confidence or extremely self-deprecating!", "Teacher Li: What you need is someone who can understand you, both in listening and in reading!", "Visitor: Hmm! But in this state, with this mindset, I don't dare to tell anyone, afraid they will think I'm crazy!", "Teacher Li: I don't know if I can become someone who can understand you, both in hearing and seeing.", "Visitor: You study this, so you should be able to befriend every client, right?", "Teacher Li: First of all, you should feel that we are friends!", "Visitor: I also want to be your friend!", "Teacher Li: I would like to know if you could share your feelings?", "Visitor: Hearing that you understand my words makes me feel that I still have hope!", "Teacher Li: Thank you!", "Visitor: I should thank you!", "Teacher Li: You have labeled yourself with many pathological tags, and these titles weigh on you like hats, making it hard for you to breathe!", "Visitor: Well, that's right! Sometimes I unrealistically suppress myself, thinking it's just luck on my side! Let's stop here for today! Thank you! I feel pretty good right now!", "Teacher Li: I also admire your uncle very much; he can help you out of that predicament in his own unique way! As for me, I can only assist you using psychological methods, but I believe that in the process of helping you, I need your cooperation and support, and we need to work together!", "Visitor: I'll schedule a time with you again tomorrow! Thank you.", "Visitor: Goodbye!"], "experience_and_reflection": "II. Diagnosis or Assessment: Reflecting on this case, the visitor's lack of self-confidence and security is a central theme that permeates his narrative. From a psychiatric perspective, the symptoms might suggest a resemblance to bipolar disorder or dissociative identity disorder, given the fluctuation between states of high confidence and deep insecurity. However, the notion of labeling or pathologizing the visitor is complex. Pathologizing not only risks reducing the visitor to a set of symptoms but can also amplify feelings of powerlessness and insecurity, which are already significant challenges for him. In alignment with the principles of postmodern psychological counseling, it becomes crucial to focus on the visitor's narrative and the meaning he derives from his experiences, rather than strictly adhering to diagnostic categories. This approach respects the visitor's unique story and acknowledges the fluidity of his identity, allowing for a more nuanced understanding.\n\nThe visitor's personality and current struggles seem deeply entwined with his personal growth experiences. His history of stuttering, the critical role of his uncle in his life, and his business ventures all contribute to his current psychological state. The stuttering, which worsens with anxiety, serves as both a symbol and a barrier in his social interactions. It highlights the interconnectedness of his self-perception, mood, and social experiences. This complexity suggests that a purely diagnostic approach would overlook the rich tapestry of his life story, which is vital for effective therapeutic work. \n\nThe visitor's past, particularly the significant setback a decade ago, has left a lingering impact. The period of isolation he endured at that time and the subsequent support he received from his uncle are pivotal in understanding his current dynamics. His recent struggles and the prolonged duration of feeling insecure and withdrawn point to the need for a sustained therapeutic approach. A course of psychological counseling, likely encompassing at least ten sessions, would provide the space for the visitor to explore these layers and foster resilience.\n\nIII. Effects of Consultation or Therapy: Although the visitor has only attended two sessions, there have been notable shifts in his emotional state. The desire to move from written communication to face-to-face interaction with the counselor during the third session marks a significant leap in his comfort and trust levels. This transition indicates a growing openness and readiness to engage more deeply with the therapeutic process. The visitor's report of feeling quite well over the past few days further underscores the potential impact of the counseling. This improvement suggests that even initial engagements in therapy can catalyze positive emotional change, laying the groundwork for deeper exploration and healing.\n\nThe shift from preferring written messages to wishing for face-to-face communication also speaks to the visitor's evolving relationship with his own vulnerability. Initially, the written format might have offered a buffer, providing a sense of safety and control over the narrative. As trust builds, the visitor appears more willing to confront his vulnerabilities in a shared space with the counselor. This transition is a testament to the therapeutic alliance and the visitor's courage to step into more challenging, yet potentially rewarding, territory.\n\nIV. Evaluation and Reflection on the Case: \n\n1. Reflection and Analysis on the Success or Failure of the Consultation Goals: Naming this consultation \"Different consultation, different feelings\" reflects the unique nature of the engagement. The choice to conduct sessions in written form via WeChat, driven by the visitor's stutter, opened new avenues for both reflection and understanding. This mode of communication, while limiting in terms of observing physical cues, offered a different rhythm and depth. It provided both the visitor and the counselor with more space to think and reflect, potentially deepening the cognitive and emotional processing of the issues at hand. \n\nHowever, this method may not be universally applicable, particularly in crisis intervention scenarios where immediate responsiveness and nuanced reading of non-verbal cues are critical. For neurotic clients, like this visitor, whose emotions are relatively stable and who possess a strong capacity for introspection, the written format can be particularly beneficial. It supports a reflective process that might be less accessible in the immediacy of spoken conversation.\n\n2. Evaluation and Reflection on the Success or Failure of the Consultation Process: The importance of the visitor's uncle cannot be overstated. His uncle represents not only a significant figure in the visitor's past but also embodies the kind of interpersonal skills and support the visitor deeply admires and aspires to emulate. The uncle's unique role in helping the visitor through a difficult time ten years ago has left a lasting impression, influencing the visitor's current self-perception and social interactions. The visitor's ongoing care about his uncle's opinion highlights a profound need for validation and acceptance from this key figure.\n\nAs the second consultation concluded, employing a reflection team approach by imagining the uncle as a third-party observer was a pivotal moment. Asking the visitor to consider what his uncle might think of him if he were listening to the consultation facilitated a powerful shift in perspective. The visitor's response, expressing a belief that understanding from his uncle would lead to healing, underscores the therapeutic potential of this reflective exercise. It transformed the consultation into a dynamic space for insight and relief, demonstrating the efficacy of narrative therapy techniques in fostering breakthroughs.\n\n3. This consultation's written record offers valuable opportunities for review and reflection. The beginnings of both sessions felt relatively stable, with questions that seemed appropriate and well-timed. However, as the sessions progressed and the visitor sought concrete methods for adjustment, his underlying anxiety began to influence the consultation's pace. This, in turn, affected the counselor's rhythm, creating a sense of urgency that was palpable in the exchanges. \n\nIn text-based consultations, managing the pace can be challenging, as it is often unclear whether the other person is contemplating or waiting for a response. This ambiguity can disrupt the natural flow of dialogue, highlighting the need for agreed-upon symbols or cues to indicate turns in the conversation. For example, using a simple system where typing \"1\" signals the start of speaking and \"0\" marks the end could help maintain clarity and continuity, ensuring that both parties are aligned in their communication.\n\nV. Expanded Clinical Analysis and Insights: Reflecting on the entirety of this case, several critical insights emerge. The visitor's life narrative is a complex interplay of past experiences, present challenges, and future aspirations. His journey from a difficult past, marked by a significant period of isolation, to his current struggles with self-confidence and social anxiety, paints a vivid picture of resilience and vulnerability. The visitor's fluctuating self-perception, influenced by external circumstances such as business success or failure, reveals a deeper struggle with identity and self-worth.\n\nThe therapeutic process, thus far, has been instrumental in highlighting these dynamics and offering pathways for change. The narrative therapy approach, with its emphasis on storytelling and meaning-making, aligns well with the visitor's needs. It encourages him to re-author his story, shifting from a narrative of deficiency and fear to one of agency and possibility. This re-authoring is not merely about changing the story but involves a profound re-engagement with his own sense of self, fostering a more integrated and confident identity.\n\nFurthermore, the visitor's reflections on the role of money in relationships provide a valuable lens through which to explore his values and motivations. His realization that interpersonal connections are not solely dependent on financial success marks an important cognitive shift. It challenges the previously held belief that wealth could compensate for relational shortcomings, opening the door to more authentic and meaningful engagements with others.\n\nThe visitor's interactions with his uncle and family members further underscore the complexity of his social world. The tension between admiration for his uncle and the fear of judgment reflects broader themes of belonging, acceptance, and self-validation. These themes are central to the therapeutic journey, as they resonate with the visitor's core struggles and aspirations. Helping the visitor navigate these relational dynamics, while fostering self-compassion and resilience, remains a key therapeutic goal.\n\nLooking forward, the therapeutic process will continue to build on these insights, fostering deeper exploration and growth. The visitor's willingness to engage in face-to-face sessions suggests a readiness to confront the more challenging aspects of his journey. Supporting him in this transition, while maintaining a focus on narrative reconstruction and self-empowerment, will be critical in helping him achieve lasting change.\n\nIn conclusion, this case offers rich insights into the complexities of social anxiety, identity, and personal growth. It highlights the transformative potential of narrative therapy and the importance of a supportive therapeutic alliance. As the visitor continues his journey, the counseling process will remain attuned to his evolving needs, providing a space for healing, reflection, and empowerment. Through this collaborative effort, the visitor can move toward a more integrated and fulfilling sense of self, equipped to navigate the challenges and opportunities of his life with confidence and clarity.", "causes": "Childhood stuttering, experiences of family support, fluctuating business success, and a deep need for recognition from key people.", "symptoms": "Social anxiety:dramatic mood swings with the rise and fall of business, social withdrawal, brain blanking, excessive concern for the judgment of others, with anxiety, insecurity and self-doubt.", "treatment_process": "Using Narrative Therapy, through two written counseling sessions, the client was guided to reflect on the source of social anxiety and encouraged to move from written communication to face-to-face communication.", "characteristics_of_illness": "The core features were lack of self-confidence and security, fluctuating between high self-confidence and deep insecurity, accompanied by impaired social interactions.", "treatment_effect": "Significant improvement in emotional state, shifting from written communication to a desire for face-to-face interaction, indicating elevated levels of comfort and trust, and initial engagement in treatment has catalyzed positive affective change."}
{"id": 185, "case_description": ["Basic situation: The visitor is a 56-year-old male farmer from southern China, a very skilled rural chef who could manage dozens of banquet tables before becoming ill. He has suffered from depression for nearly two years and has visited various specialized hospitals in different cities for treatment, using seven or eight different antidepressant medications, with symptoms recurring. After stopping the medication on his own, his depressive symptoms became even more severe. In January 2021, he chose psychological counseling, primarily using Morita therapy, and after nine WeChat video consultations, he recovered.", "Chief complaint: Two years ago, the visitor's 30-year-old son broke up with his girlfriend of two years, which caused the visitor to feel anxious, conflicted, and helpless. He couldn't stop thinking about it, and his mood gradually worsened. After being diagnosed with depression at the hospital, he became even more worried and fearful. After starting medication, he felt physically exhausted, his appetite decreased, and he gradually lost weight. He didn't want to go out and felt like he had no sense of taste or energy, causing him to stop working as a chef. He has been using antidepressants for nearly two years, receiving diagnoses and switching medications seven or eight times in different places, with symptoms recurring. After feeling a bit better, he stopped the medication, and his depressive symptoms became even more severe. He feels that this time he can't get through it."], "consultation_process": ["First consultation: After understanding the events in the son's marriage that led to depression, I affirmed the visitor's ongoing efforts and hard work for their son's marriage. I guided the visitor to reflect on the significant differences between young people's marriages and those of the previous generation, questioning whether they understand their child's marriage through their own feelings about marriage and recognizing the vast differences in marriage concepts between the two generations. The unresolved issues in the son's marriage can lead to feelings of depression for the visitor, so we approached these aspects from a Morita therapy perspective, helping the visitor learn to let go of things beyond their control and focus on what they can do. We specifically discussed three actionable items: first, engaging in regular, scheduled physical exercise for half an hour each morning and evening; second, planning one meaningful activity each day that the visitor wants to do to keep themselves engaged; third, discussing hobbies that they can pursue in their free time. I communicated to the visitor that these persistent thoughts and ideas are similar to the uncontrollable situation of having to harvest corn tomorrow and then facing rain; they belong to the realm of uncontrollable matters. Although they are connected to you, they cannot be controlled, and for the uncontrollable, the only option is to let go.", "Second consultation: The client expressed that earning money is not as easy as it used to be, many things are beyond their control, and they feel incapable of doing much. Even small tasks seem challenging, and some agricultural work is even more strenuous. Additionally, some minor issues keep repeating in their mind, making communication with others feel more difficult. The counselor expressed understanding of the client's worries and struggles, discussing what lies behind these concerns, whether they want to live a normal life and work hard to earn money like before. The client affirmed this. The counselor repeatedly emphasized supporting the client in normalizing their life and the tasks they undertake, particularly stressing the importance of regular exercise in the morning and evening, as well as engaging in meaningful activities they enjoy. The counselor continually reassured the client that through this process, their emotions would change, and many uncontrollable thoughts would ease. This week, the client will attempt to verify if what the counselor said is true.", "Third consultation: The client described that the repetitive thoughts had decreased somewhat. As a chef, during the process of organizing a banquet for others, he used to feel worried and anxious, but ultimately he completed the task. The counselor continuously explored the significance of this experience, encouraging the client to recognize his value, especially in terms of the different feelings before and after the event. They discussed the client's son breaking up with his girlfriend, who might be more focused on material life. This could lead to more picky attitudes, high demands, arguments, or even separation in future marriages. Perhaps the next girlfriend the son finds may not focus excessively on material needs and could be more gentle, which could be seen as a positive thing from this perspective. They further explored the client's hobbies; the client used to enjoy going to his orchard to manage the fruit trees during his free time, which brought him a sense of satisfaction. The counselor supported the client in integrating his hobbies into his life, suggesting that now, going to the orchard should be defined not as labor, but as a way to exercise, stay fit, and enjoy the sense of fulfillment that comes from working.", "Fourth Consultation: The counselor continuously reinforces the importance of the visitor's own thoughts and feelings during the consultation, encouraging them to express their genuine emotions and ideas. The visitor then expresses that they still feel the consultation is not very useful, as they do not see any changes in themselves. They are more concerned about not being able to manage their work effectively and feel a lot of tension and fear, and they are reluctant to meet people. The counselor expresses understanding of this, acknowledging that it may indeed be the case, while attempting to guide the visitor to observe that every feeling they have has a corresponding opposite side, from the perspective of Morita's fear of death and desire for life. For example, feeling less capable than before indicates a desire for their body to be better. Avoiding relationships with others suggests a wish for more communication. So, how can they achieve more communication, and how can they improve their physical condition? In this regard, we have solutions: if we commit to regular, scheduled exercise, our bodies will improve, and if we persist in communicating with others, our worries will decrease. Particularly regarding the reluctance to meet people, this actually reflects a desire for more interaction. While we cannot eliminate the fear of socializing, we can find ways to communicate better. Perhaps we can start with relationships that are closer and gradually expand, or talk about familiar topics with people we know well, which will lead to increased communication.", "5th Consultation: Before the consultation, I received feedback from the visiting sister, who reported significant changes in her brother's depression. He has been talking more and has become more proactive in his actions. Additionally, during the communication with her brother's son, the son provided similar feedback, noting that their father is speaking more loudly and expressing his desires more strongly, indicating that the consultation has had a positive effect. We then discussed what normalizing life entails and specifically explored three tasks to accomplish the next day. The visitor hesitated but mentioned that the first task is to change the flour, the second is to go to the village committee to inquire about processing the property ownership certificate, and the third is to check the orchard for any tasks that need to be done. The consultant offered significant affirmation and support, confirming that we would tackle these three tasks tomorrow. Later in the evening, we reflected on whether there were any changes in feelings after completing these tasks today. We also planned three more tasks for the next day, ensuring they were well organized and ready to be executed. Additionally, we identified three larger tasks to be completed over the week, which require consecutive daily efforts. After discussion, the first task is to tidy up the environment around the house and yard, organizing any clutter; the second task is to prepare for a family gathering that week; and the third task is to prune the fruit trees. Completing these tasks will help restore our lives to a normalized state, and as life returns to normal, emotions and feelings will also return to a normal state, as our decades of experience have shown.", "Sixth consultation: The visitor has shared much more this time. Not only have they completed the three tasks discussed in the last consultation, but they also felt great after organizing the environment around their home over the week. The hosting of that banquet went very well, and the consultant provided support and affirmation to the visitor. The visitor expressed pride in organizing the banquet, and the consultant offered positive reinforcement, emphasizing the significance of the large rural banquet they organized, which is like an intangible cultural heritage—something very important, unique, and irreplaceable. Even a five-star hotel chef wouldn't be able to prepare those dishes. It was also confirmed that the visitor is considered a local celebrity. Due to the issues surrounding their son's marriage, they felt anxious and ashamed, fearing that more people would find out about the situation. They worried about being judged when they went out, feeling a loss of face. Consequently, the pressure of being a public figure magnified their stress, leading to a state of depression.", "The 7th consultation: The client exhibited a completely different state compared to the previous six sessions. In earlier consultations, the therapist had to put in considerable effort, constantly finding topics and asking questions, while the client rarely expressed anything proactively. This time was entirely different; the client spoke continuously, almost without pause. The client described very important changes. On one hand, they have been consistently engaging in scheduled morning and evening exercises for several days now, going out at 5:30 AM. When there are no people around, they start with a slow jog, then run while singing loudly, sometimes even shouting. The second change is that the client no longer worries about communication, whether with acquaintances or strangers; they can now communicate naturally and normally with others. The third aspect is their work as a chef, which is now completely opposite to how it used to be. Previously, they were very worried about their strength and taste accuracy, but now they have taken the initiative to reach out for such business. Additionally, regarding their physical condition, the client is also actively making adjustments, and their blood pressure has improved, making them feel more energetic.", "Based on the visitor's stable emotional condition and positive outlook on life, the consultant suggests that the visitor consult with the psychiatrist who prescribed their medication to discuss their current situation and seek the psychiatrist's comprehensive judgment on a scientific reduction of medication, until full recovery is achieved. The scientific reduction of medication is likened to walking on two legs: one leg represents the necessity of maintaining a regular daily exercise routine throughout the entire reduction process. The other leg is the process of halving the medication every two weeks, continuing this way until the dosage is reduced to once a day at 1/4 of a pill, at which point the visitor can choose to take it or not. Currently, the medication has been reduced from taking one pill each morning and evening to taking one pill every evening. Additionally, based on the visitor's financial situation, consultations have been adjusted from once a week to once every two weeks.", "Consultation 8: The visitor describes that the sleep issue is now normal, appetite is increasing, and water intake is also rising. They feel an abundance of energy and consistently engage in scheduled exercise morning and evening. Interestingly, the visitor's wife mentioned through Baidu that the visitor seems somewhat manic, saying that after every meal, they become untraceable, often going out and continuously interacting with others. In fact, the visitor prefers to communicate with those in the village who are involved in arranging matters when someone has an issue. Currently, interpersonal relationships are very normal, and the desire to communicate is very strong, even more intense than when they were not experiencing depression.", "Based on the visitor's emotional state, interpersonal relationships, and changes in their ability and methods for handling matters, it is again suggested that the visitor seek advice from their psychiatrist to accelerate the process of reducing medication. This week, they can take half a pill daily, and next week, they can take only a quarter of a pill each day. The visitor now feels confident in hosting several tables of banquets, and the consultant is determining the value in this aspect, confirming that this value may sometimes yield more profit than the visitor's son. The visitor is now creating some new dishes and even specifically introduced to the consultant the process of making a new fried eggplant dish, which guests cannot identify but find very popular. The visitor's approach to handling some matters has changed and is now more creative, significantly different from their previous views and methods, while also being more accepting of certain difficult issues.", "9th Consultation: The client describes taking a quarter of a pill daily, but has forgotten to take it for several days. They now feel that it makes no difference whether they take it or not, believing they can fully manage their emotions. The client promptly reports the reduction in medication to their psychiatrist and receives approval. They discuss what insights they have gained looking back on their two years of depression. The client says the direct feeling is like having walked through the gates of hell; it has been very painful. They now notice some changes in their personality, feeling more proactive and methodical in their work as a chef than before. The counselor guides the client to reflect on what helped them after coming out of depression, or what played a larger role. The client describes that psychological counseling has been very significant, noting that medication can only provide early assistance and does not resolve the root issues. The counselor encourages the client to recognize that their changes mainly stem from normalizing their life, engaging in daily activities, and maintaining a regular exercise routine. This has gradually restored the body's ability to regulate emotions, which is the most significant aspect of their recovery.", "Finally, the visitor consulted the therapist and asked if a situation like theirs would recur. The therapist once again emphasized to leave the illness to the doctor and keep life for oneself. Just like when they were hospitalized before, after being discharged, they never worried about a recurrence. The visitor expressed understanding and thanked the therapist. The consultation ended with an agreement to follow up in two months.", "Two months later, during a follow-up visit: After stopping medication for more than two months, I consulted my psychiatrist again and was told that I could stop taking medication. I am now so busy that I don't even think about my depression anymore. The business of my mobile restaurant is getting better and better, and several nearby villages come to me for assistance. When I'm not hosting banquets, I work in the orchard. My relationships with others and with my family are all very good, and I have a relatively positive and enthusiastic attitude in my interpersonal relationships."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on this case of using Morita therapy for a client suffering from depression, there are numerous insights and lessons that can be drawn from the entire process. Initially, it was apparent that the client’s depression was intricately linked to personal circumstances, particularly the emotional turmoil stemming from his son's breakup. This observation underscores the profound impact of relational and situational factors on mental health, especially in individuals from close-knit family structures or communities where family events hold significant weight. The client’s reticence in earlier sessions, characterized by sparse verbal engagement, is often misinterpreted as a lack of willingness to participate or communicate. However, through this experience, it became evident that such behavior is more reflective of the depressive state itself rather than an inherent character trait. Depression often manifests as a heavy blanket, suppressing the ability to articulate feelings or engage readily in dialogue. Therefore, as clinicians, it is crucial to approach these sessions with patience and understanding, recognizing that the silence holds unspoken narratives of struggle and distress.\n\nThe integration of Morita therapy, which emphasizes acceptance of feelings and focusing on action rather than symptom control, proved to be particularly effective in this scenario. A significant learning point was the client’s gradual shift in perception regarding control and acceptance. Initially, the client was entangled in a web of uncontrollable worries related to his son's personal life and the subsequent community perceptions. Through the therapeutic process, particularly the philosophical underpinnings of Morita therapy, the client began to distinguish between what was within his control and what wasn't, redirecting his energy towards meaningful activities and daily routines he could influence.\n\nOne of the pivotal moments in therapy was the introduction of regular, quantified physical exercise. While the immediate uptake was not as rapid as anticipated, the eventual engagement with exercise marked a turning point in the client’s recovery. It highlighted the importance of physical activity in managing depressive symptoms, not just for its physical benefits but also for its role in instilling a sense of routine and purpose. This case reinforced the necessity of encouraging physical activity as a therapeutic intervention in depression treatment plans, though it requires persistent encouragement and structured planning to align with the client’s readiness and pace. As the client began to experience the positive effects of exercise, there was a notable improvement in mood and an increase in energy levels, which further facilitated engagement in other aspects of life.\n\nThe client’s journey also illustrated the significance of cultural and personal identity factors in therapeutic work. The client, being a skilled rural chef, derived a substantial part of his identity from his professional capabilities. His inability to work during the depressive episodes compounded his feelings of worthlessness and loss of identity. Recognizing and validating the client’s unique skills and contributions, such as organizing large banquets and being a local celebrity, served as a powerful tool in rebuilding his self-esteem and sense of purpose. This aspect of therapy was crucial in helping the client reclaim his role within the community, transforming what was once a source of stress into a platform for reintegration and healing.\n\nMoreover, the client’s progression highlighted the dynamic nature of interpersonal relationships and their influence on mental health. Initially, the client's interactions were fraught with tension and avoidance, driven by a fear of judgment. However, as therapy progressed and the client’s self-perception improved, there was a noticeable shift towards open and proactive communication. This change underscores the role of self-acceptance and confidence in enhancing social interactions and reducing the fear of negative evaluation. Encouraging the client to engage with familiar and supportive social networks helped foster a sense of belonging and safety, which in turn alleviated feelings of isolation.\n\nAnother significant reflection from this case was the importance of understanding the context of depressive episodes in non-endogenous, situationally-induced depression. The client's depression was deeply rooted in personal and familial stressors rather than biochemical imbalances, making Morita therapy a particularly suitable approach. The therapy's emphasis on living through one’s feelings rather than attempting to control or eliminate them provided the client with a framework to navigate his emotional landscape without being overwhelmed by it. This approach, combined with structured daily activities, helped restore a sense of normalcy and balance in the client’s life.\n\nThe case also illuminated the potential for creative problem-solving and adaptation in the face of adversity. As the client’s depressive symptoms abated, there was a remarkable increase in his initiative and creativity, particularly in his culinary work. This resurgence of creativity not only contributed to his professional success but also served as an important indicator of recovery, reflecting the restoration of cognitive and emotional flexibility. Encouraging clients to engage in creative pursuits can thus be an effective strategy in facilitating recovery, providing both a therapeutic outlet and a means of self-expression.\n\nIn terms of medication management, the collaborative approach between the psychological and psychiatric interventions was instrumental. The careful reduction of medication, guided by the client’s psychiatrist and informed by the client’s improved mental state, exemplified a holistic and patient-centered approach to treatment. This case reinforced the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in achieving optimal outcomes, particularly in cases where medication plays a supportive role rather than the primary treatment modality.\n\nFinally, the client’s inquiry about the potential recurrence of depression provided an opportunity to emphasize the importance of ongoing self-care and the maintenance of therapeutic gains. By framing health management as a lifelong process rather than a finite treatment episode, the therapy aimed to empower the client with skills and strategies that would support long-term well-being. The case concluded with a positive outlook, highlighting the potential for recovery and resilience even after prolonged periods of distress.\n\nIn summary, this case of Morita therapy application in depression recovery offers a wealth of insights into the therapeutic process, client engagement, and the importance of tailored, culturally sensitive interventions. It emphasizes the value of patience, understanding, and a focus on actionable change, demonstrating the profound impact that structured therapy and supportive interpersonal relationships can have on an individual’s journey to recovery.", "causes": "Emotional trauma from son's breakup, patient's inability to stop thinking about it, gradual deterioration of mood.", "symptoms": "Depression, low mood, helplessness, anxiety, physical exhaustion, loss of appetite, weight loss, reluctance to leave the house, social fears.", "treatment_process": "Use of Morita therapy, acceptance of emotions, guiding the patient to focus on actionable actions, such as physical exercise, planning meaningful activities, etc., to gradually return to normal life.", "characteristics_of_illness": "recurrent depression, symptoms are closely linked to the personal situation, manifested as emotional, physical and behavioral disorders in various aspects.", "treatment_effect": "Recovery after nine counseling sessions, significant improvement in symptoms, life back on track, and eventually stop taking medication and re-enter a busy and active life."}

General Information of the Help-Seeker  \nLiu, female, 20 years old, has a younger brother, a student majoring in electromechanical technology starting from the 10th grade in high school. She has been introverted since childhood, very beautiful, naturally gifted, not talkative, and loves studying. Her health is normal, with no significant history of physical illness. There is no history of mental illness in three generations of her family. Both parents are farmers.\n\n2. Self-Reported Issues  \nChief complaint: Depressed mood, feeling down, disinterest in everything, lack of sense of meaning in life, dizziness, fatigue, gastrointestinal discomfort, and insomnia.  \nPersonal statement: I have been introverted and love reading since childhood, performing well academically from elementary school to middle school. Although I have a good figure and am naturally beautiful, I have never considered dating boys, apart from a little pride and narcissism, only wanting to study hard. After entering university, I ranked first in every exam and was appointed as class monitor. Due to my good figure and appearance, as well as my excellent academic performance, I often attract the attention of boys and jealousy from girls. I have good quality long hair, often sitting in the front row, and boys frequently look at the back of my head. Girls and boys often play and joke together, but I am not used to participating. In the dormitory, female classmates often ask me which skincare products and shampoos I use, and which type of boys I like, but I only use a basic moisturizer and cheap shampoo every day. I really love reading and want to pursue further studies, never thinking about romance, so I just casually respond when they ask me. I never expected they would misunderstand me for not sharing my beauty secrets. Many boys like me and write letters to me, but I do not take it seriously. Over time, they started gossiping about me with other girls, thinking I only wanted to date very handsome guys. Some girls even said I was psychologically abnormal, which I felt was a huge insult. I wished my mother had made me a bit uglier so I wouldn’t suffer so much. My eyesight is slightly myopic; I have to squint to see the blackboard, so the girls in class often speculate about whom I have a crush on and whisper about my \"flirtatious\" eyes. I am in pain, covering my eyes with my long hair and only exposing them when looking at the blackboard, yet some still say I am pretending to be aloof. Later, I asked my mother to get me glasses, but she said my eyesight was only slightly myopic and didn’t get them for me because it would cost several hundred yuan. I kept feeling like my eyes were really abnormal, and I worried about what I would do if they truly were. I often find myself in a state of pain and depression, experiencing insomnia for a period, going to class feeling dizzy the next day. I no longer even use basic moisturizer, and I cut my hair short, but I am still very afraid of going to school. Whenever school is mentioned, I feel no interest at all; I often feel my life has no meaning. With all the commotion from these girls and boys, how can I attend university? I still want to go to a real university and make something of myself. I frequently feel I have no value.\n\n3. Observations and Understanding by the Counselor  \nLiu expresses herself fluently, articulating clearly, though sometimes overly emphasizing details and speaking slowly. She wears androgynous clothing, has short hair, and often wears a sun hat. Yet, it is still evident that the visitor is an undeniable beauty. Six months ago, Liu was diagnosed with depressive neurosis by the hospital's psychological outpatient department and is currently taking Sertraline and Fluoxetine. The first three months of medication were very effective, allowing her to study and live normally. However, after a boy began to show her excessive attention, a girl started to pick on her, constantly creating difficulties for her. Subsequently, her emotions fluctuated again. Liu's mother reported that Liu loves studying and often reads at home, is introverted, and does not interact much with classmates. There was one time when she suddenly asked me, \"Mom, why didn’t you make me a bit uglier?\" For a while, she kept asking me to get her glasses, but I said she only had slight myopia and didn’t need them. Recently, she often complains of dizziness and headaches, taking many medications with no effect, and I don’t know what illness my child is suffering from.\n\n4. Results of Psychological Testing  \nTo make an accurate diagnosis, the following psychological assessments were conducted with the consent of Liu and her parents to determine the nature of her psychological issues and rule out early signs of mental illness.  \n1. Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS): Raw score 62, standard score 77.5.  \n2. Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS): Raw score 54, standard score 67.5.  \n3. Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90): Total score: 188. Positive items count: 61  \n   Somatization 2.2, Obsessive-Compulsive 1.5, Interpersonal Relations 2.2, Depression 2.8, Anxiety 2.4, Hostility 1.8, Phobic Anxiety 2.1, Paranoid Ideation 1.6, Psychoticism 1.8, Other 2.2  \n4. Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ): E (Introversion-Extraversion): T score 32, N (Neuroticism): T score 72, P (Psychoticism): T score 54, L (Lie scale): T score 5.\n\n5. Assessment - Diagnosis  \nBased on the collected clinical data and psychological test results, Liu's SDS standard score exceeds the cutoff by 9.5 points; the SAS standard score exceeds the cutoff by 4.5 points; the SCL-90 has multiple results exceeding the normal range, particularly high in the depression factor; the EPQ results indicate that the help-seeker has a relatively introverted personality, and her temperament type is melancholic. The diagnosis for this help-seeker is depressive neurosis. The main symptoms of depressive neurosis include: low or sad mood, loss or reduction of interest, feeling that life itself is meaningless, self-blame or loss of self-confidence, suicidal thoughts or behaviors, pessimism about the future, and the condition lasting more than three months. This case meets the above characteristics and can be diagnosed as depressive neurosis.  \nDifferential diagnosis and basis: Differentiating from schizophrenia: According to Guo Nianfeng's three principles of distinguishing disease from non-disease, the help-seeker's awareness is unified, she has insight into her psychological problems, exhibits proactive medical seeking behavior, has clear logical thinking, and lacks perceptual abnormalities, hallucinations, delusions, or other symptoms of mental illness, thus excluding schizophrenia. Differentiating from anxiety disorder: Anxiety disorders lack a specific object for anxiety emotional experiences. In this case, the help-seeker does have anxiety emotions, but they are based on reality. Anxiety disorders also accompany psychomotor agitation, which this student does not exhibit. Therefore, although the student experiences anxiety, she does not meet the diagnostic criteria for anxiety disorder, thus excluding it.\n\n6. Counseling Strategies and Process  \n1. Short-Term Goals  \n   (1) Help Liu view her current situation and the events around her through reasonable beliefs and cognition, overcome extreme and negative views, and develop rational beliefs to view the people and things around her.  \n   (2) Vent her inner frustrations, relieve internal pain, release negative emotions, and establish positive feelings.  \n   (3) Conduct social skills training to help Liu improve her interpersonal relationships with classmates, making them closer, more harmonious, and more amicable.  \n2. Long-Term Goals  \n   Based on achieving the above specific goals, ultimately promote Liu's mental health and development, achieving personality perfection. Enable her to step out of the shadows and live and study happily.  \n3. Formulating the Counseling Plan  \n   (1) Counseling methods and principles: Through cognitive therapy, help the student recognize her erroneous beliefs, particularly the core erroneous belief that \"she cares too much about others' evaluations,\" and engage in cognitive restructuring. Through behavioral therapy, help the student learn constructive behaviors to change and eliminate maladaptive interpersonal behaviors, allowing her to find herself in activities. Counseling principle: Changes in a person's emotions and behaviors are related to their perceptions, attitudes, and views of the real world. Different perceptions of the same event will lead to different emotional and behavioral responses. Therefore, by changing cognition, one can change negative emotions and behaviors, thus learning to face other life issues correctly and promoting comprehensive psychological health development.  \n   (2) Responsibilities and Obligations of Both Parties:  \n   Student's Responsibilities:  \n   ① Provide the psychological counselor with true information related to psychological issues.  \n   ② Actively explore solutions to problems with the psychological counselor.  \n   ③ Complete assignments agreed upon by both parties.  \n   Student's Obligations:  \n   ① Follow the relevant regulations of the psychological counseling room.  \n   ② Abide by and execute all aspects of the agreed counseling plan.  \n   ③ Respect the psychological counselor and keep scheduled appointments, informing the counselor in advance of any special circumstances.  \n   Counselor's Responsibilities:  \n   ① Adhere to the professional ethics of psychological counselors and comply with relevant national laws and regulations.  \n   ② Assist students in resolving psychological issues.  \n   ③ Responsible for the students, having the right to propose referrals or terminate counseling if necessary.  \n   Counselor's Obligations:  \n   ① Introduce their training background to the student and present relevant professional qualification documents.  \n   ② Comply with the relevant regulations of the school’s psychological counseling room.  \n   ③ Abide by and execute all aspects of the agreed counseling plan.  \n   ④ Respect the student, keep scheduled appointments, and inform the student in advance of any special circumstances.  \n4. Counseling Schedule and Location: Scheduled for every Wednesday at 2:30 PM in the psychological counseling room, once a week, for 50 minutes each session.  \n5. Counseling Process:  \n   First Stage: Diagnostic Stage (Initial)  \n   The main task of this stage is to establish a counseling relationship with Liu, collect relevant data, conduct psychological diagnosis, adjust unreasonable help-seeking motivations, set counseling goals, and formulate implementation plans. This stage concluded with a consensus with Liu to step out of her psychological shadow, face classmates' discussions calmly, learn interpersonal skills, and transform back into a sunny, cheerful, and confident girl. Both parties consider this a concrete and feasible counseling goal.  \n   Second Stage: Counseling Stage (Mid-term)  \n   This is the most crucial and important stage of counseling. The main task of the psychological counselor in this stage is to help the student analyze and solve problems, and change her unreasonable cognitions, emotions, and behaviors. After 12 counseling sessions, the student was able to change her negative emotions, recognize her erroneous beliefs, and conduct self-evaluation more accurately.  \n   Third Stage: Consolidation Stage (Late)  \n   This stage primarily focuses on consolidating, summarizing, and enhancing counseling, enabling Liu to transfer these changes into all aspects of life, thereby improving her mental health level. The student is now able to face reality more calmly.  \n\n7. Specific Process  \n   (1) Cognitive Therapy  \n   1. Identify Unreasonable Beliefs: Depressed individuals often hold negative views of everything around them, reflected in negative beliefs about themselves, the world, and the future. Many depressed individuals believe they have no value, the world is full of contradictions, and the future is dark. Their beliefs display polarization, catastrophizing, and overgeneralization. Negative perceptions lead to negative emotions, which further exacerbate negative perceptions. Therefore, a vicious cycle occurs between negative perceptions and negative emotions. To change this vicious cycle, it is essential to start with changing negative beliefs, subsequently altering negative perceptions, ultimately achieving the goal of changing behavior.  \n   (1) The counselor first uses an \"emotion diary\" to help Liu open the door to her feelings and identify unreasonable beliefs.  \n   Emotion Disturbance Diary  \n   Date | Triggering Event | Thoughts | Outcomes (Feelings and Behavioral Responses) | Level of Depression  \n   (2) Guide Liu to repeatedly examine which beliefs make her feel depressed, helping her distinguish between reasonable and unreasonable beliefs.  \n   ① Others' opinions are important.  \n   ② One absolutely cannot fall in love while studying.  \n   ③ My personality is introverted and cannot be changed.  \n   ④ I am not good at socializing.  \n   ⑤ Classmates are all hostile towards me.  \n   2. Challenge Unreasonable Beliefs: Through debating unreasonable beliefs, guide Liu to analyze the rationality of her thoughts, helping her recognize the irrationality of her unreasonable beliefs. Overturn existing beliefs using factual reality, rational common sense, and logical thinking.  \n   ① Others' opinions are important: Life is one’s own; why are others' opinions important? It makes no sense.  \n   ② One absolutely cannot fall in love while studying: If I study until I'm 25 or 26, can I not fall in love? It makes no sense; if I meet the right person, what harm is there in dating?  \n   ③ My personality is introverted and cannot be changed: There is a book called \"Cultivating Your Character\"; a person’s personality can be changed.  \n   ④ I am not good at socializing: Interpersonal skills are not an innate instinct but a skill that can be learned.  \n   ⑤ Classmates are all hostile towards me: Why would there be hostility? It makes no sense. Classmates’ attitudes should depend on my attitude towards them.  \n   3. Develop Reasonable Beliefs: The counselor assigns Liu homework, guiding her to learn reasonable beliefs and internalize them as her own views. Finally, she concludes with reasonable beliefs:  \n   ① Others' opinions are not important; my feelings are what matter.  \n   ② If I do meet someone truly compatible, there is no harm in dating.  \n   ③ A person's character is not innate; it can be cultivated.  \n   ④ Interpersonal skills can be developed.  \n   ⑤ If I am friendly to others, they will reciprocate.  \n   The subsequent series of counseling sessions focus on Liu and her experiences of being laughed at. The counselor explores the nature of Liu's automatic thoughts. \"The girls who mock her are among the most popular in class,\" the counselor challenges Liu’s belief that \"only being liked by these girls makes one valuable.\" Below is an excerpt from the dialogue regarding this issue.  \n   Counselor: Do these girls like everyone in the class?  \n   Liu: Of course not.  \n   Counselor: Are you saying there are other girls in the class who are not their friends?  \n   Liu: Yes.  \n   Counselor: So, what do you think about those girls who are not part of this group? Are they valueless?  \n   Liu: I never thought that… they are certainly not valueless.  \n   Counselor: Then, why? If you are valueless because you are not their friend, shouldn’t all those who are not their friends also be valueless like you?  \n   Liu: No, some of them are good students.  \n   Counselor: Even if they are not part of this group?  \n   Liu: I think so.  \n   Counselor: Can you tell me who those girls are? Why do you think they are good students?  \n   (Liu describes those girls who are not mocked and their merits.)  \n   Counselor: Then, if these girls can be good students even though they are not members of that small group, why can’t you?  \n   Liu: Oh, maybe I can.  \n   Counselor: It sounds like you lack confidence. Maybe you have many merits, even if you are not one of them.  \n   Liu: Oh, I never thought that.  \n   Counselor: Then let’s think about it. Do you have merits?  \n   Liu: I think I do.  \n   Counselor: What merits do others think you have?  \n   (Liu mentions some friends she has had over the years and why they liked her. Her mother also shares positive feedback from other friends and cousins about her.)  \n   Counselor: Oh, I guess you are not worthless.  \n   Liu: I suppose not. But that doesn’t make them like me.  \n   Counselor: You are right. But must they like you?  \n   Liu: Of course not. They can dislike anyone. They only have eight friends. There are more girls in our class. So I think they can’t possibly be good friends with everyone.  \n   Counselor: There are also other classes and grades. So are all those who are not friends with this small group \"bad\"?  \n   Liu: I think not.  \n   Counselor: Then why are you \"bad\"? What is different between you and those other girls who are not popular?  \n   Liu: I feel there is no difference. But I only think of myself and not others.  \n   Counselor: Is this useful?  \n   Liu: Not really.  \n   Counselor: Why? Why is it not useful?  \n   Liu: I don’t know. I think it’s related to myself, not to others.  \n   Counselor: Then if they can be fine even if they are not liked by that small group, why can’t you?  \n   Liu: I never thought of that.  \n   Counselor: Then try it. Just say out loud, \"I am as good as other students. I don’t need to be liked by them to be a good person.\"  \n   Liu: I can’t remember that much.  \n   (The counselor repeats it, and Liu tries to repeat it three times.)  \n   Counselor: So, if you really think this way, how would you feel?  \n   Liu: I think I would feel a bit better.  \n   Counselor: Good, remember how you felt when you thought that during our practice. After three such dialogues, Liu's feelings about being laughed at improved significantly. After seven counseling sessions, I asked her mother to mock her like those girls to help her practice the coping strategies we used in previous therapies. These can achieve emotional goals.  \n   (2) Behavioral Therapy  \n   1. Role Play  \n   ① Problem and Situation Description: The counselor helps the help-seeker identify a typical example.  \n   ② Role Assignment: The protagonist is the help-seeker, and the supporting role is the counselor.  \n   ③ Role Play: By providing guidance, instruct the help-seeker to enter the role as if in a real situation, and not to stop even if problems arise midway. Enter the role play process.  \n   ④ Information Feedback: Point out what the help-seeker did well and where improvements can be made, discussing how to improve together.  \n   ⑤ Imitation Learning: Allow the help-seeker to adopt the counselor's suggestions, practice new behaviors, or engage in role substitution, feeling the inappropriateness of their original behaviors, and actively mimicking the counselor’s demonstration of new behaviors to learn suitable behavior styles.  \n   ⑥ Reinforcement Guidance: The counselor should reinforce appropriate behaviors demonstrated by the help-seeker during the role play and encourage the application of new behaviors in real life.  \n   2. Interpersonal Skills Training  \n   ① Remember others' surnames or names, take the initiative to greet people, and use appropriate titles to make others feel respected and valued, creating an approachable impression.  \n   ② Behave gracefully and confidently, making others feel relaxed and comfortable, stimulating the motivation for interaction.  \n   ③ Cultivate a cheerful and lively personality, making others feel that being with you is enjoyable.  \n   ④ Cultivate humorous and witty behaviors that are amusing yet not overboard, providing an aesthetic experience. When interacting with others, be humble and polite; otherwise, things may not go as desired.  \n   ⑤ Stay calm and avoid complaining; this not only makes oneself happy and cultured but also uplifts others' moods.  \n   ⑥ Pay attention to the charm of language: comfort those who are hurt, encourage those who have failed, compliment those who have truly achieved, and help those in need.  \n   ⑦ Being decisive, opinionated, energetic, and confident can easily stimulate others' motivation to interact, winning their trust and creating an engaging charm.\n\n8.

At the time of the consultation, my approach was firmly rooted in cognitive and behavioral therapies, which were well-suited to address the immediate cognitive distortions and maladaptive behaviors presented by Liu. Cognitive therapy, with its structured approach to identifying and challenging irrational beliefs, and behavioral therapy, focusing on modifying observable behaviors, provided a framework through which Liu's depressive neurosis could be effectively addressed in the short term.\n\nLiu's case was, in many respects, a textbook example of depressive neurosis manifesting through interpersonal difficulties. Her introverted nature, combined with the external pressures of university life and the social dynamics within her peer group, exacerbated her feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy. At the time, the focus of the consultation was to address these pressing issues by helping her develop a more rational perspective on her interactions and to equip her with the necessary social skills to navigate her environment more effectively.\n\nLooking back, while the interventions were successful in alleviating Liu's symptoms, I realize that the consultation might have benefited from a more comprehensive exploration of her early childhood experiences and family dynamics. Psychoanalysis, which I was not proficient in at the time, could have offered insights into the unconscious patterns and defenses that may have been influencing her current emotional struggles. Understanding the formative experiences that shaped her self-concept and worldview could have provided a richer context for the therapeutic work.\n\nIn the realm of cognitive therapy, we focused extensively on identifying and challenging Liu's core irrational beliefs, such as her perception of others' opinions as paramount and the idea that her introverted personality was immutable. By employing techniques such as the \"emotion diary\" and structured dialogue, we were able to dissect these beliefs and replace them with more adaptive cognitions. Liu's journey through cognitive restructuring illustrated the power of this approach in creating cognitive shifts that led to emotional relief and behavioral changes.\n\nBehavioral therapy played a crucial role in reinforcing these cognitive changes. Through role-playing exercises and social skills training, Liu learned to engage with her peers more confidently and assertively. These interventions were instrumental in breaking the cycle of avoidance and withdrawal that perpetuated her depressive symptoms. The use of real-life simulations and feedback allowed her to practice and internalize new interpersonal strategies in a supportive environment, which translated into improved social interactions and a greater sense of agency.\n\nIn addition to these interventions, the consultation provided an opportunity to examine the broader systemic factors contributing to Liu's distress. Her family background, marked by a lack of understanding of her psychological needs, and the cultural expectations placed upon her as a young woman in a competitive academic environment, were significant stressors. While these were acknowledged during the consultation, a more in-depth exploration of these factors, possibly through family therapy or systemic interventions, might have provided additional support for Liu's recovery.\n\nReflecting on this case from my current professional vantage point, I am struck by the resilience and adaptability Liu demonstrated throughout the therapeutic process. Her willingness to engage with the therapeutic work and her openness to change were pivotal to the positive outcomes achieved. This underscores the importance of fostering a strong therapeutic alliance, which was a cornerstone of the consultation. Establishing trust and creating a safe space for Liu to explore her thoughts and emotions facilitated her willingness to confront and challenge deeply held beliefs.\n\nOver the years, my understanding of depressive neurosis and its treatment has deepened. I have come to appreciate the importance of integrating various therapeutic modalities to address the multifaceted nature of this condition. While cognitive and behavioral therapies remain essential tools in my practice, I now incorporate elements of psychodynamic and existential therapies to explore the deeper existential and relational dimensions of depression. This holistic approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of the individual's inner world and the existential questions that often accompany depressive experiences.\n\nFurthermore, my ongoing professional development has reinforced the significance of self-reflection and continuous learning in the field of psychotherapy. Engaging with professional literature, attending workshops, and participating in supervision have enriched my practice and expanded my therapeutic repertoire. The case of Liu serves as a reminder of the dynamic nature of psychological work and the need for clinicians to remain open to new insights and approaches.\n\nIn conclusion, the consultation with Liu was a formative experience that highlighted the strengths and limitations of cognitive and behavioral therapies in addressing depressive neurosis. While the interventions were effective in the short term, a more comprehensive exploration of Liu's early experiences and systemic influences might have provided additional insights and facilitated deeper healing. This reflection underscores the importance of an integrative approach to therapy, one that honors the complexity of the human experience and embraces the richness of diverse therapeutic traditions. As I continue to grow in my professional journey, I remain committed to refining my skills and expanding my understanding, guided by the enduring goal of supporting individuals in their pursuit of mental health and well-being.", "causes": "Introverted personality, difficulties in peer interactions, comments from others, and family neglect of psychological needs.", "symptoms": "depressed mood, loss of interest, physical discomfort, insomnia, etc.", "treatment_process": "Cognitive therapy was used to identify and challenge irrational beliefs, behavioral therapy for social skills training, and counseling was implemented in stages.", "characteristics_of_illness": "depressive neurosis with multiple manifestations of mood, cognition, and behavior.", "treatment_effect": "Symptoms were relieved, social adaptation was improved, and psychological state was improved."}

Recently, her second boyfriend, whom she had been living with for six months, suddenly proposed to break up with her. The visitor cannot accept this fact and is determined to salvage the relationship, hence seeking advice."], "consultation_process": ["Consultation time: August 9, 2018. Location: Telephone voice.", "3. Consultation objective: How to win back my boyfriend's heart?", "4. Consultation process: The visitor has a history of cohabitation with her first boyfriend. A year ago, she gave birth to a boy, and then they broke up. This failed cohabitation left a significant psychological shadow on her. She said that sometimes she really hates her ex-boyfriend for tying her down, for the unexpected pregnancy, for not allowing her to have an abortion, and for leaving her with a scar, which she has to explain every time she starts a new relationship. Before she began dating her second boyfriend, she had already decided that because of this scar, she might only date once more. If that doesn't work out, she probably wouldn't look for a partner again until she feels too lonely in old age. Due to complications from postpartum surgery, she hasn't been able to do much work for over a year, and she originally felt that no one would be able to accept someone like her. However, her second boyfriend said he didn't mind her, which was really heartwarming. Although he says he doesn't mind, he sometimes thinks about seeing other people. They usually get along well, like a regular couple, and they don't argue. He works while she tidies up at home, and they sleep together when he comes back. However, because they haven't been together for the past two months, she has been trying to find ways to keep in touch with him through her phone. Yesterday, he suddenly suggested breaking up, which was a significant blow to her! They met through online karaoke, and over time, they developed feelings for each other. They started living together six months ago. He is a 25-year-old chef who also came to the big city to work.", "He is a meticulous person. Actually, when I was with my ex, I did everything—acting both as a man and a woman, which was exhausting. However, being with my current partner is very comfortable. I want to show off that he can accompany me; I want to act cute and he can comfort me. He takes me to his workplace, and when I see him tired, I will tidy up the house and wait for him to come back, prepare foot bath water for him, and help him wash his work clothes. He treats me very well, and doing these things makes me feel very happy. Sometimes, when I see him tired, I feel embarrassed since I don't have a job! Every time he gets paid, he saves a portion and gives me most of the rest, keeping only a few hundred for himself as pocket money. Over time, I tend to give him most of my money since he is out working! Usually, I also help him save the money I haven't spent. Two months ago, I went back to my hometown because a relative was holding a graduation banquet. I wanted to stay with my mother and stepfather for a while and help my younger brother with his studies.", "Last night, my boyfriend suddenly called to say he wanted to break up with me. This unexpected blow was hard for me to accept, and I don’t understand why he wants to break up. I suspect he still can’t accept the fact that I have a child. Right now, I feel especially dependent on people; my dad passed away last year, and I long for paternal love. My mom's new boyfriend is nice to me, but sometimes I struggle to accept the idea of my mom being with a stranger. However, seeing my mom happy and not lonely gives me some comfort, though I still feel uncomfortable at home. That’s why I tend to look for partners who are a few years older than me; someone more mature would be more considerate. My boyfriend not only provides me with love, but sometimes I feel the paternal love I’m missing from him as well, so I rely on him a lot! He’s a chef, and last week he said, “I don’t want to work at this place anymore!” I comforted him, saying he could find a more suitable job. I had planned to go back to work and had already contacted several job opportunities, just waiting to go back for interviews! He mentioned that he has been receiving quite a bit of cash gifts this month, but his monthly salary of 4000 isn’t enough. I transferred him 1000 to ease his burden! But I don’t understand why he only brought up breaking up yesterday? He also said he didn’t want me to come back because he felt embarrassed to see me, and he would mail my luggage back to me! He said it very decisively! I guess even if I went back, he wouldn’t meet me, but we can’t just break up without any reason! Plus, I have a key, so whenever I go back, I might run into him if he’s home; I think he can’t avoid that! (What a naive thought!)"], "experience_and_reflection": "The visitor's case presents a complex intertwining of personal history, emotional needs, and relational dynamics, which have shaped her current situation. Reflecting on this case, it is evident that the visitor's emotional landscape is deeply influenced by her past experiences and the scars they have left on her psyche. The absence of paternal affection during her formative years seems to have created a vacuum in her emotional needs, leading to feelings of inferiority and insecurity. These feelings were exacerbated by her father's recent passing, which reignited unresolved emotions and intensified her longing for paternal love. This longing appears to manifest in her relationships, where she seeks out partners who can provide not only romantic affection but also a paternal sense of security and validation.\n\nThe visitor's first relationship, which resulted in an unplanned pregnancy and subsequent breakup, appears to have been a significant turning point. The decision to carry the pregnancy to term, coupled with the emotional and physical challenges she faced during and after childbirth, has left her with a profound sense of vulnerability. The \"scar\" she mentions is both literal and metaphorical, symbolizing the burdens she carries into new relationships. Her description of having to act in both traditional gender roles during her previous relationship suggests an overwhelming sense of responsibility and exhaustion, which likely contributed to her feelings of inadequacy.\n\nIn her relationship with her current boyfriend, the visitor describes a sense of comfort and acceptance that she had not experienced before. His initial willingness to overlook her past and embrace her present circumstances provided her with a sense of hope and security. This relationship became a source of emotional refuge, allowing her to temporarily set aside her feelings of inadequacy and dependency. However, her boyfriend's sudden decision to end the relationship seems to have shattered this sense of security, leaving her grappling with confusion and devastation.\n\nReflecting on the visitor's attempts to salvage the relationship, it is crucial to acknowledge her determination and resilience. However, it is equally important to explore the underlying motivations driving her actions. The visitor's narrative reveals a pattern of dependency, where she derives a significant portion of her self-worth from the approval and affection of her partner. This dependency may stem from the unresolved paternal issues and the need for external validation to compensate for her internal insecurities. Her insistence on finding ways to remain connected with her boyfriend, despite his clear desire to distance himself, highlights her struggle to let go of the relationship and confront her fears of abandonment and loneliness.\n\nThe consultation process provided an opportunity to explore these complex emotions and begin the journey toward self-awareness and healing. The initial goal of understanding why her boyfriend decided to break up and how to win him back was rooted in a desire to restore the lost sense of security and belonging. However, it became evident that focusing solely on these objectives would not address the deeper issues at play. The consultation aimed to guide the visitor toward a more profound understanding of her emotional needs and the factors contributing to her current situation.\n\nA key aspect of the consultation was helping the visitor differentiate between genuine love and the fulfillment of unmet emotional needs. This differentiation is crucial for her to develop a healthier sense of self-worth that is not solely dependent on the presence of a partner. The process involved encouraging the visitor to reflect on her past relationships and identify recurring patterns that may be influencing her current behavior. By acknowledging these patterns, the visitor could begin to disentangle her self-worth from her relationships and explore other sources of emotional fulfillment.\n\nThe visitor's reflections during the consultation revealed an underlying fear of facing life alone and the belief that she is unworthy of love due to her past experiences. This belief appears to be a significant barrier to forming a stable and fulfilling relationship. Addressing this belief required a careful and compassionate exploration of her self-perception and the narratives she has constructed about herself. Narrative therapy techniques were employed to help the visitor re-author her life story, focusing on her strengths, resilience, and potential for growth.\n\nOne of the most significant insights gained from the consultation was the visitor's realization that her partner's decision to end the relationship might not be a reflection of her inadequacy but rather a result of his own circumstances and emotional needs. This shift in perspective was crucial in alleviating some of the self-blame and guilt she was experiencing. Understanding that relationships are dynamic and influenced by multiple factors allowed the visitor to view the breakup as an opportunity for personal growth rather than a definitive judgment of her worth.\n\nThe consultation also highlighted the importance of addressing the visitor's feelings of paternal longing. Her reliance on partners to fulfill this role has created a dependency that hinders her ability to form autonomous relationships. Exploring alternative ways to satisfy these emotional needs, such as through self-care, personal achievements, or supportive friendships, became an integral part of the therapeutic process. Encouraging the visitor to engage in activities that foster a sense of independence and self-efficacy was essential in building her confidence and reducing her reliance on external validation.\n\nAs the consultation progressed, the visitor began to engage in more rational thinking and take responsibility for her actions and their consequences. This shift was facilitated by creating a supportive and understanding environment where she felt heard and validated. The process of acknowledging her feelings and exploring her emotional landscape allowed the visitor to develop a more balanced view of herself and her relationships. While the immediate goal of winning back her boyfriend's heart may not have been achieved, the consultation succeeded in fostering a sense of psychological comfort and empowerment.\n\nReflecting on the overall effectiveness of the consultation, it is evident that the process of focusing on the visitor as a person, rather than solely on the issues, was instrumental in facilitating meaningful change. This approach ensured that the visitor felt supported and understood, providing her with the strength to navigate her challenges. By balancing the exploration of issues with a focus on personal growth, the consultation avoided becoming trapped in problem-solving alone and instead fostered a holistic understanding of the visitor's experiences.\n\nIn conclusion, the visitor's journey through this consultation highlights the intricate interplay of past experiences, emotional needs, and relational dynamics that shape one's perception of self and relationships. By delving into these complexities and guiding the visitor toward self-awareness and empowerment, the consultation provided a foundation for healing and personal growth. While the road ahead may still hold challenges, the insights gained through this process equip the visitor with the tools to forge a more fulfilling and autonomous path forward.", "causes": "Lack of father's love since childhood led to low self-esteem and insecurity, the breakup of a previous relationship with an unwanted pregnancy left a psychological shadow, and the end of the relationship with the current boyfriend brought a shock.", "symptoms": "Dependence on partner's approval, difficulty in accepting breakup, fear, despair, self-blame and guilt.", "treatment_process": "Using narrative therapy to guide her to understand her emotional needs and relationship influences, differentiate between love and emotional needs, reflect on relationship patterns, explore her self-worth and rewrite her life story.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Strong emotional dependence, lack of self-worth, inner \"unworthy of being loved\" belief, fear of facing life alone, difficulty in self-adjustment in the face of the end of relationships.", "treatment_effect": "Increased psychological comfort and empowerment, ability to think rationally about relationship issues, more balanced perception of self and interpersonal relationships, although she did not get her boyfriend back, she gained a foundation for healing and growth."}
{"id": 188, "case_description": ["Xiao A (pseudonym), male, a sophomore student at a university. He is afraid of speaking in public, especially terrified of being called on by the teacher in class. When his name is mentioned in class, he feels his heart racing, discomfort in his chest, tightness in his scalp, numbness, spasms, stiffness in his neck, his entire face becomes rigid, and his brain reacts slowly. When there are many people around, he also feels uncomfortable when speaking or chatting and experiences similar symptoms.", "This situation began a year ago, in the second semester of my freshman year. At that time, I was the class representative for math, and the teacher valued and liked me very much. Almost every class, the teacher would ask me questions, especially when difficult problems arose; I would be the first one called on. Initially, I felt proud of this and was able to answer questions well. However, after a chance incident where I couldn't answer a question, I began to feel burdened and anxious during math classes. Especially after the teacher posed a question, the expectant gaze would make me extremely nervous, my heart would race, my scalp would tighten, and my mind would go blank. This situation worsened, and I became increasingly reluctant to attend math class, feeling too tense and exhausted, which also led to a decline in my math performance. I later realized that I was growing more afraid of speaking in public, even in other classes or crowded situations, and I became extremely sensitive to the attention of others. Now, I am unwilling to participate in any extracurricular activities, reluctant to showcase myself, and I don't want others to notice me, even regarding my strengths and talents. I want to be an anonymous, ordinary person. Little A came for advice with the goal of changing the excessive nervousness and fear associated with speaking in front of groups, along with the accompanying uncomfortable physiological symptoms."], "consultation_process": ["According to the visitor's account, the SCL-90 test results, and the counselor's assessment, Xiao A's condition falls under moderate anxiety.", "The research methods employed include observational methods, interview methods, cognitive therapy, and behavioral relaxation training, combined with clinical suggestive learning and emotional organizer techniques from metacognitive intervention to conduct case studies on the clients.", "Cognitive adjustment involves many psychological disorders and behaviors that are the result of subconscious actions operating automatically. The essence of this process is the operation of procedural knowledge, which runs automatically or executes a certain behavior under the influence of emotions, without being consciously aware of it, without the need for conscious monitoring, or when consciousness cannot monitor it. Therefore, helping clients fully understand and comprehend how their psychological barriers and behaviors are formed and operate is an important aspect of psychological correction.", "First, let Xiao A understand the psychological mechanism behind his fear of being asked questions in class and speaking in public. Xiao A feels very proud to receive questions and attention from his math teacher, but after failing to answer a question once, he feels he has let the teacher down and worries about being laughed at by his classmates. This kind of thinking leads to feelings of self-blame, guilt, and anxiety, which gradually makes him feel psychological pressure and burden during math class. He becomes concerned about not being able to answer questions, and as a result, attending math class becomes associated with tension, anxiety, and fear. This negative emotional state may manifest in uncomfortable physiological symptoms, such as a racing heart, numbness or tingling in the scalp, spasms, and a stiff neck. These physiological responses can affect his thinking, making it difficult for him to respond quickly and answer the teacher's questions as well as he used to. This, in turn, exacerbates his anxiety and tension regarding math class, creating a vicious cycle. Later, this conditioned response generalizes, leading to similar uncomfortable physiological reactions whenever he speaks in situations with many people, which further intensifies his fear and nervousness about speaking in crowded settings.", "Secondly, let Xiao A understand the relationship and significance of \"being noticed\" and \"noticing others\" in life. Being noticed is a psychological need of individuals, a need for respect and self-actualization, and a positive and healthy psychological necessity. Those who are noticed often have more opportunities to showcase themselves and can better stimulate their own potential. Each of us experiences moments of noticing others and being noticed; there is no absolute state of \"not being noticed,\" so seeking a life completely free of attention is unrealistic, and such a pursuit can harm self-esteem and lead to negative emotions like repression and depression. Additionally, do not be too harsh on oneself; no one is perfect, and even outstanding individuals have weaknesses, flaws, and moments of imperfection. It is important to learn to face and accept one’s imperfections calmly.", "Finally, do not be afraid of a series of physical discomfort symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, scalp spasms, and neck stiffness; these symptoms are related to anxiety. Once the psychological issues are resolved, these adverse symptoms will also disappear.", "1.4.2 Adjustment of Behavior and Emotions Little A is afraid of speaking in public, afraid of being questioned by the teacher, and afraid of being the center of attention because his anxiety has created a conditioned reflex associated with public speaking. This is a subconscious conditional emotional response; when the math teacher asks him a question, it automatically triggers his intense feelings of anxiety, tension, and fear. This negative emotional state leads to a series of uncomfortable physical symptoms, such as increased heart rate, scalp spasms, numbness, stiff neck, and slow brain responses. Later, this conditioned reflex generalized, and he would experience these uncomfortable reactions when questioned by other teachers or when being watched in a crowd.", "After Little A recognized and understood the psychological mechanisms behind problem formation, a 5-day psychological relaxation training was conducted, with one session each day. In clinical practice, using suggestion techniques, when the subject's body reached a very relaxed state and their mood was very pleasant, the designed emotional organizers and a corresponding set of new procedural knowledge were input into their brain. Through repeated training, this knowledge was made to operate automatically. In this way, the efficient learning process under suggestion broke the old procedural knowledge in their brain and replaced it with newly established procedural knowledge, thereby preventing the occurrence of the original negative conditioned emotions and controlling their subconscious behavior.", "The first two relaxation training sessions primarily focused on desensitizing specific situations related to classroom questioning. Once desensitization was successfully achieved, the third relaxation training involved desensitizing speaking in various social situations, utilizing the emotional organizer technique. During the practice, when Xiao A recalled their previous excellence and envisioned becoming a senior white-collar worker, able to face various occasions and interact effortlessly with diverse individuals, their mood became increasingly calm, proud, and joyful. As positive emotions replaced negative ones, their cognition and behavior also shifted towards a more positive direction.", "In addition, during the intervention process, he was taught some relaxation techniques and proper deep breathing methods. This way, when he encounters stressful situations and experiences high levels of tension and anxiety, he can consciously use these methods for self-regulation, such as deep breathing and positive self-suggestions. The last two relaxation training sessions were used to reinforce the training results and provide him with some health maintenance advice for both body and mind."], "experience_and_reflection": "After the clinical intervention, Xiao A's transformation was both remarkable and inspiring. The once reticent and anxious student became noticeably more cheerful and optimistic. Observers noted a newfound brightness in his demeanor; he smiled more often, spoke with a louder and more assured voice, and exuded energy and confidence. This change was not merely superficial. It was rooted in the profound shifts in his internal landscape, achieved through a series of well-structured interventions that addressed the underlying psychological mechanisms contributing to his anxiety.\n\nReflecting on the journey, it is evident that the foundation of Xiao A's recovery was a comprehensive understanding of his condition, which was initially assessed as moderate anxiety through both subjective reporting and objective measures like the SCL-90 test. The intervention plan drew from a blend of cognitive therapy and metacognitive strategies, grounded in the principle that subconscious processes significantly influence conscious behaviors and emotions. Xiao A's fear of public speaking and the associated physical discomfort were manifestations of deep-seated subconscious conditioned responses, a realization that guided the therapeutic approach.\n\nOne of the critical steps in Xiao A's therapy was helping him grasp the psychological mechanism that led to his fear. The initial pride and recognition he felt from being a favored student in math class turned into a source of anxiety after an incident where he was unable to answer a question. This singular event catalyzed a cascade of self-doubt, guilt, and fear of ridicule, which intensified with each subsequent interaction in similar settings. Understanding this chain reaction was crucial for Xiao A to begin disentangling his emotions and physiological responses from the stimulus of being called upon in public.\n\nThe intervention also focused on Xiao A's perception of attention and its psychological implications. Being noticed, often a double-edged sword, is a fundamental human need tied to respect and self-actualization. Xiao A's wish to remain unnoticed stemmed from a skewed interpretation of this need, driven by his anxiety. Through therapy, he was encouraged to view attention as an opportunity for growth rather than a threat, a shift that was instrumental in reshaping his emotional and cognitive responses to public speaking.\n\nCognitive therapy played a pivotal role in reframing Xiao A's automatic thought patterns. The sessions aimed to dismantle the negative conditioned emotional responses that triggered his anxiety. By introducing new procedural knowledge through suggestion techniques during relaxation, Xiao A learned to replace his automatic reactions with more positive, adaptive responses. This process was reinforced through repeated relaxation training, which served to break the cycle of anxiety and discomfort.\n\nThe five-day relaxation training was a cornerstone of Xiao A's recovery. The initial sessions targeted the specific anxiety-inducing situations related to classroom questioning. As he became desensitized to these triggers, subsequent sessions broadened the scope to include various social situations, using emotional organizer techniques. Imagining himself as a successful and confident individual in different contexts helped Xiao A internalize a positive self-image, which gradually replaced his previous anxiety-laden perceptions.\n\nMoreover, practical strategies like deep breathing and self-suggestion were integrated into Xiao A's daily routine, equipping him with tools for self-regulation. These techniques proved invaluable during moments of heightened stress, allowing him to manage his anxiety proactively and maintain his newfound equilibrium.\n\nThe long-term follow-up of Xiao A's progress further validated the effectiveness of the intervention. One month after the initial sessions, he reported feeling consistently well, with his counselor and peers recognizing his potential. His active participation in the student council and subsequent election as vice minister of the academic department underscored his regained confidence and social functionality. Over the ensuing months, his progress remained stable, with no relapses into previous anxiety patterns.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the rapid and lasting success of Xiao A's therapy. First, a precise analysis of the psychological disorder's mechanism allowed for targeted cognitive adjustments. By addressing the subconscious conditional emotional reflexes, the therapy fostered a positive feedback loop between emotions and cognition. The emotional organizer techniques were particularly effective in mobilizing Xiao A's positive emotions, facilitating quick therapeutic gains and reinforcing his confidence in recovery.\n\nXiao A's inherent qualities also played a significant role in his rehabilitation. His history of excellence and self-assurance provided a robust foundation upon which to rebuild his self-esteem. The intervention tapped into these latent strengths, accelerating his journey towards overcoming his fear of public speaking.\n\nIn conclusion, this case underscores the efficacy of an integrated therapeutic approach, combining cognitive therapy, relaxation training, and metacognitive interventions, in addressing public speaking anxiety among college students. Xiao A's story is a testament to the power of understanding, resilience, and targeted intervention in transforming anxiety into opportunity and potential. As clinicians, the insights gained from this case enrich our practice, offering valuable lessons in tailoring interventions to meet the unique needs of each client, fostering not just recovery but genuine personal growth and empowerment.", "causes": "Little A's failure to answer a math question resulted in negative perceptions and anxiety, which gradually spread to other occasions.", "symptoms": "Rapid heartbeat, chest discomfort, scalp tightness, numbness, twitching, stiff neck, facial rigidity, and slow thinking when speaking in public.", "treatment_process": "Cognitive therapy and metacognitive strategies were applied to make him understand the psychological mechanism of fear, then relaxation training was conducted for 5 days, new procedural knowledge was inputted through suggestive techniques, and relaxation techniques and deep breathing methods were also taught to consolidate the Treatment effect.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Moderate anxiety, subconscious conditioned emotional responses, and distorted perceptions of attention.", "treatment_effect": "After the intervention, Xiao A became cheerful and confident, her physical symptoms disappeared, and she was able to cope with social occasions with ease.

However, my son also has his advantages: he is honest, obedient, kind, and serious about work. I realize that my son's current rebelliousness and lack of opinions are related to my strict upbringing. I hope my son can find a more open-minded, understanding, and good-tempered daughter-in-law. Relatives and friends have advised me to take a more detached approach to this matter, as I mainly worry that my daughter-in-law's temper is too fierce and that my son will suffer in the future! My concern for their happiness is truly for their benefit. I also want to approach my son's marriage in a \"cool\" manner, but my uncontrollable temper often leads to overthinking, which makes me quite distressed. The visitor recognizes that this is her issue and has been making efforts. She said what she mainly cannot accept is the attitude of her son and daughter-in-law; how could her daughter-in-law dare to argue with her before marriage? This makes her feel embarrassed, and she believes that if her son and daughter-in-law could just apologize, the problem would be resolved. She has thought many times about initiating communication with them, but currently, communication is not smooth. She believes that if the family can communicate well, all problems can be resolved! In the end, our consultation goal is to find ways for her to achieve effective and smooth communication with her son and daughter-in-law!", "5. Personal Analysis: Currently, the issue within this family seems to be that the mother-in-law cannot accept the future daughter-in-law, being critical of her past, such as the girl's health, temperament, and character, focusing more on the problems than on the positive aspects. Through this situation, we can observe the characteristics of the visitor: a pursuit of perfection and a critical attitude towards others. It also reveals the visitor's patterns of thinking and behavior in dealing with people, which is an area where the visitor needs to grow. In the consultation, we should first focus on the visitor as a person. The counselor needs to recognize not just the visitor's shortcomings and flaws but also the efforts and difficulties the visitor has faced in solving problems. We should witness the visitor's journey and enhance their confidence and strength in problem-solving.", "VI. Reflection on the Success or Failure of the Consultation Goals: The husband took the initiative to seek consultation, and he is the driving force behind resolving this issue. However, the focus of the consultation should be on the wife, primarily addressing her emotional issues. The resolution of the wife's emotional problems also relies on the husband's support and the efforts of the whole family. In fact, everyone in this family wants to solve this problem, but they mainly lack direction in their efforts! The key to solving this issue lies with the mother-in-law. Her willingness to seek consultation indicates her desire for change. Therefore, it is important to recognize her efforts, acknowledge her difficulties, listen to her grievances, and witness her goodwill. The goal is to nourish and empower her during the interview, giving her the confidence and strength to address this issue on her own.", "7. Reflection on the Consultation Process: 1. Since it is family counseling, circular questioning is essential. For example: Who do you think could offer you some support in this matter? The client’s response is that her sister and younger sister could provide support! This response shows us that the client's thoughts are changing: she initially expressed feeling particularly lonely and that no one understands or supports her!", "As long as we open up the space for dialogue, the visitors will also witness themselves: the visitor said, \"I want to thank this matter as well. In the past, my relationship with my in-laws in the countryside was not good. After this incident, I learned to think from their perspective and realized how difficult it is to be a parent-in-law. Now my relationship with them is getting better and better!\"", "Before the consultation ends, it's important to review and summarize the interview, allowing both parties to gain more insights and reflections from the consultation process. This is a rich technique in narrative therapy!", "8. Effect of this consultation: The visitor said in WeChat; after the consultation, the wife's mood still changed, and she felt much better!", "Homework: Homework for the mother-in-law. If you want to communicate this matter to your son and daughter-in-law through a letter, how would you write this letter appropriately? During the writing process, it is hoped that you will seek your husband's opinion more often!"], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on this case has provided profound insights into the intricate dynamics at play within this family, particularly the relationship between the mother-in-law and the daughter-in-law. The title, \"How to Unravel the Curse Behind the Conflict Between Mothers-in-Law and Daughters-in-Law?\" sets the stage for understanding the underlying tensions that are often referred to as a \"curse.\" This so-called curse is emblematic of the complex interplay of personality traits, familial roles, and long-standing cultural narratives that can result in conflict.\n\nAt the heart of this discord is an outgoing and outspoken daughter-in-law who challenges the status quo maintained by the mother-in-law. The mother-in-law, accustomed to being the central authority within her household, perceives this new dynamic as a threat. This perception is intensified by the fact that the daughter-in-law mirrors some of the mother-in-law’s own personality traits, such as assertiveness and a strong will. This mirroring can lead to a projection of unresolved issues, where the mother-in-law sees in her daughter-in-law the reflection of what she might have been in her younger years, and perhaps the conflicts she faced or avoided.\n\nThe son, who is caught in the crossfire, is a product of his upbringing—raised by a mother whose own high standards and critical nature have shaped him into a docile, introverted, and indecisive individual. This is a classic example of how family systems perpetuate certain roles and behaviors. The son’s decision to bring home a strong-willed partner may unconsciously be an attempt to balance his own lack of assertiveness, seeking in his partner what he feels he lacks.\n\nIn counseling, the focus should not solely be on the visible surface conflicts but rather on understanding the deeper systemic issues that contribute to these tensions. The mother-in-law’s participation in counseling is a significant indicator of her willingness to change. It is crucial to validate her experiences and acknowledge her efforts to adapt, as she attempts to reconcile her expectations with the realities of modern family dynamics.\n\nFrom a clinical perspective, we need to delve into the concept of power and control within family relationships. The mother-in-law’s need for control may stem from a variety of sources, including cultural norms that value elder authority, personal insecurities, or a history of unmet needs. Her critical nature could be a defense mechanism to maintain her perceived authority and relevance within the family structure. Addressing these aspects requires a delicate balance of empathy and challenge, helping her to see that relinquishing some control does not equate to losing her identity or value.\n\nThe daughter-in-law’s position is equally complex. As a highly educated and independent individual, she represents a shift in generational expectations. Her assertiveness, while a strength, may also be interpreted as defiance in a family system that has traditionally valued compliance. Encouraging her to understand the family’s dynamics and the mother-in-law’s perspective could foster empathy and pave the way for more constructive interactions.\n\nThe role of the son in this dynamic is pivotal. His perceived passivity may frustrate both women, leading them to vie for his allegiance. Helping him to develop a stronger sense of self and more assertive communication skills is essential. This can empower him to mediate conflicts more effectively, supporting both his partner and his mother in finding common ground.\n\nThe consultation process revealed that everyone in this family desires resolution but lacks a clear direction. This highlights the importance of providing a structured framework for communication and conflict resolution. Techniques such as circular questioning have been instrumental in this case, opening up dialogue and allowing family members to express their needs and feelings without fear of judgment or reprisal. This approach not only addresses the immediate conflicts but also promotes long-term changes in how family members relate to each other.\n\nFurthermore, the mother-in-law’s reflections on her upbringing and the realization of her critical tendencies are significant. Her acknowledgment of these patterns suggests an openness to personal growth and change. This is a crucial step in breaking the cycle of conflict, as it shifts the focus from blame to understanding and self-awareness. Encouraging her to continue exploring these insights through activities like writing letters or seeking support from friends and family can reinforce her progress.\n\nIn reflecting on the effectiveness of the consultation, it is clear that the husband’s role as a supportive partner is crucial. His initiative in seeking help demonstrates his commitment to resolving the conflict, but his support must extend beyond the sessions. Encouraging him to actively participate in the process, offering emotional support to his wife, and facilitating open communication within the family are essential components of a successful outcome.\n\nUltimately, the goal of counseling in this case is not just to resolve the immediate conflict but to foster a resilient family system capable of navigating future challenges. This involves empowering each family member to recognize their role in the dynamic, develop effective communication skills, and approach conflicts with empathy and understanding. By doing so, the family can transform the \"curse\" into an opportunity for growth and deeper connection.\n\nIn conclusion, this case underscores the complexities inherent in family dynamics and the importance of a systemic approach in therapy. It highlights the need for patience, empathy, and a willingness to engage with difficult emotions and entrenched patterns. Through continued reflection and guided intervention, the family can move towards a more harmonious and fulfilling relationship, breaking the cycle of conflict and embracing a future built on mutual respect and understanding.", "causes": "The mother-in-law pursues perfection and is critical, and finds it difficult to accept a daughter-in-law whose personality is very different from her own; the roles and behaviors in the family system are solidified, and the son's personality is submissive and introverted, so he fails to reconcile the conflicts effectively.", "symptoms": "A mother-in-law is low and lonely, a daughter-in-law's relationship with her mother-in-law is deteriorating, and a son is caught in the middle of a difficult situation.", "treatment_process": "Using the family therapy cycle of questioning and other techniques, the mother-in-law was guided to reflect on and adjust her thinking and behavioral patterns to facilitate family communication.", "characteristics_of_illness": "The family is characterized by conflict between traditional and modern concepts, power and control issues, and rigidity in the way members interact with each other.", "treatment_effect": "The mother-in-law's mood improved, the family relationship eased, the mother-in-law was able to try to think from others' perspectives, and the relationship with her in-laws improved."}

The first consultation date is December 8, 2019.", "A month ago, the visitor took the subway and experienced anxiety and panic reactions due to the sound of the train, with feelings of tension and numbness lasting for four hours. After visiting the hospital, he was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. Knowing this result made the visitor uneasy and restless, fearing that such an incident would happen again, and he was scared of mental illness. He had strong and uncomfortable reactions whenever he encountered words related to mental health, with his level of tension remaining at 100 (as he described). He contacted me a month after the incident. After three months of 20 counseling sessions, the visitor reported a significant reduction in symptoms and a much calmer state of mind. With guidance from the counselor, he was able to better self-regulate and manage his life."], "consultation_process": ["Consultations 1 to 5: The visitor used to be a motivated, ambitious, and proactive person. After this shock, they have become lethargic, thinking of cosmic black holes, feeling that life has no meaning, as if they have seen through the mundane world. They find this strange themselves and feel confused about life, often falling into a state of chaotic thinking. They want to stop this chaotic thinking and seek help.", "In the consultation, I listen to the visitor's feelings, exploring his emotions and thoughts together. In the previous sessions, the main focus was on listening to him express himself and helping him become more aware of his psychological state, guiding him to gain deeper insights into his mental activities. When appropriate, I provide some explanations about his psychology. For example, when he went to the hospital and the doctor told him he was experiencing anxiety and depression, he felt that it was the end for him, which intensified his negative reactions. I explained to him that this is a mental interaction, and that such reactions make him feel worse; the more he worries and fears, the more frantic he becomes, and the more severe his symptoms become. When I explained that mental illness lacks self-awareness and clarified that he was not mentally ill, he suddenly felt a sense of relief as his worries dissipated, halting the mental interaction. Usually, he feels empty and distracted, as if his soul is not present, but during the consultation, it seemed like his soul returned all at once, and he became normal again, laughing heartily.", "When I guided him to free associate, he thought of cosmic black holes (the reason he thought of cosmic black holes was actually a form of detachment, a way to find balance, as he found reality hard to accept. I appropriately explained this to him). I inspired him to associate with that feeling, and he thought of loneliness. The second time I prompted him to associate with loneliness, he connected it to stress. The third time I encouraged him to associate with stress, he realized that what was important was that his parents made him feel pressured; his parents were in debt, and he was helping them pay it off. This year, he sent over 300,000, which he borrowed himself. He couldn’t express the grievances he felt to his parents. When he was a child, his parents would argue, and he wished for the family to be harmonious, so he felt he had to work hard and maintain the family. I guided him to express what he wanted to say to his parents. Imagining saying those things to the counselor, he spoke a lot, and the teacher listened quietly; he felt much better inside.", "Consultation 6 to 10: I inspired him to associate his feelings of loneliness, to relax first and then to free associate. He thought of three things: first, his parents; second, his girlfriend; and third, living for himself. At that moment, he also found it strange that the feeling of loneliness was associated with living for himself; it was in this state that he made that connection. I felt there was a link, perhaps it was the idea of extremes leading to opposites. This was a voice from his heart, a need, a genuine psychological state. When he thought of living for himself, he felt it meant abandoning his parents and girlfriend, which he believed was wrong, and he was very afraid of that. I guided him to set aside thoughts of his parents and girlfriend for the moment, to focus on the feeling of living for himself, to observe that feeling without judgment, just to look at this psychological state objectively. He realized that this brought him liberation and freedom; the pressure from his parents and girlfriend seemed to dissolve, and everything appeared to be easily resolved. He became excited. Even when he encountered words related to mental health, he no longer felt afraid. It seemed like the world had changed for him, yet he expressed concern that this way of thinking might be wrong. I suggested adding a bit of the element of living for himself and to carry that feeling into life. After consulting with me, his level of anxiety dropped from 100 points to 20 points.", "He also mentioned that his childhood friend's mother suffers from depression. He often went to their house to play and had a lot of contact with her, which had some negative effects on him, such as a fear of mental illness and absorbing some negative energy.", "The visitor gained a lot from this experience. It was my first time having such an in-depth interaction with the visitor's inner self, and he gained a lot. I felt my own value and a sense of accomplishment.", "Sessions 11 to 15: In the last session, he explored the idea of living for himself. However, in the past few days, he has forgotten this thought and believes it is wrong, being suppressed by his original perspective of considering his parents. He mentioned that thinking this way means abandoning his parents. The homework assigned was to live for himself and to incorporate a bit of this mindset, but he has completely disregarded it. This indicates that his original beliefs are very strong, making it difficult for his belief in living for himself to take root. Consequently, the uncomfortable energy he feels psychologically will continue to grow.", "Subjectively, he lives for his parents and has given too much for them. On one hand, he feels very dissatisfied inside and wants to live for himself. If this energy is not released properly, it will find different ways to manifest, becoming pathological, which is actually a way of seeking satisfaction. I have noticed that his parents have a significant impact on him; he only shares good news and keeps his worries to himself. Last night at ten o'clock, I encouraged him to try to express what he wanted to say to his parents. He was initially reluctant, but I told him to give it a try, and he would end up saying more. As a result, he spoke for an hour about his true feelings, the hardships and setbacks he has experienced, and his current life, including his illness. It was somewhat like narrative therapy. After listening, I said three things: \"Child, you have suffered. You are really great. You need to think more about yourself.\" He wanted to continue for another hour, but I told him I was tired. It was already an hour late. It was eleven o'clock, and I suggested we discuss it next time.", "Regarding him and his girlfriend's trip to Qinhuangdao (they spent three days there, he was very happy but also conflicted), he cried bitterly while talking about it, feeling both wonderful and guilty towards his girlfriend, fearing that he might burden her. This brought to mind his sense of loneliness, which is a knot he has tied to his childhood. After this second session of crying, he felt much lighter.", "During a consultation again, I was in a bad state, and an attendee who consulted with me that afternoon got angry with me, which stirred up my emotions. I was very upset and held it in, feeling uncomfortable. Due to my state, I only consulted for one hour that evening instead of the planned two hours. After the consultation, my emotions stabilized a bit, but I’m not sure what I said; perhaps I expressed my feelings quite openly. When he mentioned whether he was abnormal, I said yes. (According to diagnostic criteria, he was indeed abnormal; anxiety neurosis falls within the abnormal range, but such a statement was unhelpful for him because he feared the term \"mental illness,\" which could cause him further confusion). His symptoms worsened, and he began to doubt me, which he told me during the next consultation. In the following consultation, he was in a bad state, possibly influenced by the fact that he had stopped taking the medication prescribed by his doctor. For a while, he was caught in a dilemma about whether to take the medication; he was afraid of side effects from taking it, but worried about losing control if he didn’t take it. I pointed out to him that all medications have some toxicity, even cold medicine has side effects, so should we not take any medication? The key is to see the efficacy; the benefits far outweigh the side effects, so taking medication is worthwhile. I told him that to recover, enduring pain is a necessary process. Later, he said that during the consultation period, he had only taken one-sixth of the amount of medication his doctor recommended. He mentioned that he wanted to bear it with his body, and this kind of strength is something I can learn from. When I feel uncomfortable while trying to quit smoking, I think of what he said about bearing it with his body.", "Consultations 16 to 20: During the follow-up consultation, his condition was quite poor, and he expressed doubts about me. I struggled to keep him calm. He felt a bit better after the consultation and scheduled another one ten days later. The next day, he reached out to me for another consultation, which I declined. When the time for the next scheduled consultation arrived, I sensed he was a bit excited and talked non-stop. The therapeutic relationship seemed good; he mentioned he would continue to seek my services next year and plans to gradually reduce the frequency of consultations. I feel he is a person with a plan.", "This year, he consulted me twice, and he told me he is much better. I told him that summarizing his experiences of getting through it would be beneficial for him. During our consultation the day before yesterday, I asked him to summarize the factors that helped him get through, and he said one was counseling, one was medication, one was time, and there seemed to be another, which I think should be his physical state and his understanding. Many of his previous chaotic thoughts have disappeared, but now he feels an inexplicable fear when he hears planes. I told him this is just a manifestation of psychological energy, which will always find an excuse to express itself; it will always find a breakthrough. He can face it using the methods he used before, but the key lies in his own understanding, and what he understands will benefit him for life. I told him that his original family has a significant impact on him, and although he feels somewhat uncomfortable and skeptical, he trusts me, so he is somewhat conflicted. I suggested that he write about his original family, his growth experiences, and feelings, and discuss it with the teacher next time."], "experience_and_reflection": "In reflecting on this case, several key insights have emerged that deepen my understanding of the intricate relationship between anxiety, personal history, and the struggle to live authentically. The journey with this client has been both challenging and enlightening, offering valuable lessons in the realm of psychotherapy.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of this case was the client's intense internal conflict between his ingrained responsibilities towards his family and his emerging desire to live for himself. This dichotomy represents a fundamental human struggle: the tension between societal or familial expectations and personal aspirations. The client's background, being from Northeast China and now working in the fast-paced environment of Beijing's internet industry, adds layers to his experience, reflecting broader socio-cultural dynamics. The pressure he felt to support his indebted parents financially, borrowing significant sums of money to maintain familial harmony, speaks to a deep-rooted cultural norm of filial piety, which can often lead to overwhelming stress and guilt.\n\nIn our sessions, the use of Imagery Dialogue proved to be a pivotal technique. This method allowed the client to access and articulate feelings that were otherwise buried under layers of obligation and fear. Through guided free association, he was able to connect disparate thoughts and emotions, leading to profound insights. For instance, the imagery of cosmic black holes initially represented a form of escapism but eventually became a metaphor for the loneliness and pressure he felt. This realization was crucial in understanding that his anxiety was not just a reaction to external stimuli but a reflection of internalized emotional conflicts.\n\nA critical turning point in therapy was when the client began to explore the notion of living for himself. Initially, this idea was fraught with guilt and fear, as he equated it with abandoning his familial duties. However, by encouraging him to temporarily set aside these thoughts and focus on the liberating aspects of self-autonomy, he experienced a sense of freedom and relief. This newfound perspective allowed him to reduce his anxiety significantly, from a debilitating 100 to a manageable 20. It highlighted the therapeutic power of reframing one's narrative to align more closely with authentic desires.\n\nThe client's response to social media was another area of exploration. His strong emotional reaction to seeing friends enjoy their lives without apparent burdens revealed a sense of disparity and envy. By understanding that this feeling of imbalance was a protective mechanism—a form of emotional numbness to avoid confronting unmet needs—he could begin to process these emotions constructively. This insight underscored the importance of addressing perceived inequities and their impact on mental health.\n\nThroughout our work, the client's fear of mental illness was a recurring theme, exacerbated by a past association with a friend's mother who suffered from depression. This fear was intertwined with his anxiety, creating a vicious cycle of avoidance and distress. By normalizing these fears and educating him on the nature of psychological conditions, we dismantled some of the stigma he associated with mental health, allowing him to view his experiences through a more compassionate and less judgmental lens.\n\nThe therapeutic process also revealed the complexities of medication adherence. The client's ambivalence towards taking prescribed medication reflected a broader struggle with control and trust—both in himself and in medical interventions. This ambivalence was a microcosm of his larger life narrative: the desire to endure and overcome challenges independently. By framing medication as a tool rather than a crutch, he was able to reconcile his need for autonomy with the benefits of pharmacological support.\n\nReflecting on my role as a clinician, I recognize the delicate balance between guiding the client and respecting their autonomy. There were moments when my own emotional state inadvertently influenced the therapeutic dynamic, particularly when faced with doubts about my approach. This experience has reinforced the importance of self-awareness and regulation as a therapist, acknowledging that our own vulnerabilities can impact the therapeutic alliance.\n\nThe client's journey has been a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the transformative power of psychotherapy. His story illustrates the profound impact of familial expectations on personal identity and the courage required to challenge these narratives. As clinicians, we must navigate these complex emotional landscapes with empathy and patience, fostering an environment where clients feel safe to explore and redefine their sense of self.\n\nIn conclusion, this case has deepened my appreciation for the intricate interplay between cultural, familial, and personal factors in the development and treatment of anxiety disorders. It has highlighted the necessity of a holistic approach, one that considers the client's unique context and empowers them to live more authentically. The insights gained from this therapeutic relationship will undoubtedly inform my future practice, reminding me of the enduring strength found in vulnerability and the enduring quest for personal authenticity.", "causes": "family of origin stress, parents in debt, client's financial burden, and the influence of family discord since childhood.", "symptoms": "subway panic attacks, anxiety, depression, fear of mental illness, feeling of nervousness and numbness.", "treatment_process": "free association through imagery dialog method, reconstruction of the \"live for yourself\" narrative, while providing medication support.", "characteristics_of_illness": "High anxiety intensity, closely related to the conflict of family responsibilities, with repeated fluctuations.", "treatment_effect": "Significant improvement of symptoms, reduction of anxiety level, and improvement of psychological regulation."}
{"id": 191, "case_description": ["Ms. C, 27 years old, married, has a daughter under one year old, currently unemployed and staying at home to take care of the child, and she is the only child in her family. Her husband is a stationed soldier from Ms. C's hometown, and they had a good relationship in the early days. Her husband bought a house in her area and planned to develop there. During Ms. C's breastfeeding period, her mother-in-law came to help take care of the baby, which led to conflicts between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. The mother-in-law became angry and wanted to go home, and Ms. C, out of spite, did not persuade her to stay or see her off. After her husband returned to his hometown, his attitude changed drastically, becoming extremely indifferent towards Ms. C and even mentioning divorce."], "consultation_process": ["Analysis and Assessment: Ms. C, as an only child, initially exhibited a certain level of pride and stubbornness. Moreover, as she was newly married and in the sweet period of her relationship, her husband was very accommodating, which allowed her to maintain a dominant position in the marriage. Her mother-in-law was also very assertive at home, often taking the lead, which made conflicts between the two women likely to arise over trivial matters. Ms. C's husband lacked assertiveness; he cared for his wife but was also very obedient and respectful to his mother. Therefore, when conflicts arose between Ms. C and her mother-in-law, he was somewhat at a loss and allowed the situation to deteriorate. The counselor noticed two distinct attitudes in Ms. C: one was arrogance and stubbornness before the situation worsened, and the other was weakness and fear after the deterioration. This reflects her insufficient self-strength, indicating a need for personal growth. It is difficult for Ms. C to quickly develop a strong inner self or to rapidly gain rich interpersonal experience in a short time. Thus, in the early stages, given the urgent need for relationship repair, the counselor needed to guide her step by step in initiating some repair actions, even speaking on her behalf in conversations with her husband. The biggest challenge in the relationship repair process was to ensure a steady progress in the relationship while also safeguarding Ms. C's dignity. After experiencing two instances of being \"bitten by a snake,\" establishing her posture and confidence became a challenge in the counseling work.\n\nCounseling Process: First, boosting confidence. Ms. C sought help after experiencing two instances of being indirectly abandoned by her husband and subjected to emotional neglect. Consequently, she felt frustrated, anxious, negative, and confused. The counselor provided precise analysis of her situation, pointing out that her husband was equally fragile and confused, but his heart had not left her and their child. A specific repair strategy was devised for her, allowing Ms. C to see hope again and relieve some pressure. Second, continuous warm support. Ms. C's husband actually had very low personal initiative; while with Ms. C, he could understand and care for her, but once he returned to his parents' home, he was heavily influenced by his mother's perspective, believing that she had been treated very unfairly and that his wife was unreasonable and difficult. This impression occupied his mind, and thus, his attitude needed a process of change at the start of counseling. This was also a period of anxiety for Ms. C, so the counselor provided her with ample patience, guidance, encouragement, and strength. Third, opening a dialogue with her husband. The counselor noticed that the husband still had affection for his daughter, so they effectively collaborated with Ms. C to communicate with him. Meanwhile, the counselor guided Ms. C to showcase her personal charm. Under the dual influence of parental and romantic love, the husband's cold attitude improved; conversations increased, and he even began to initiate chats. When the time was right, the counselor helped Ms. C write a \"reflection letter,\" acknowledging her mistakes and analyzing the reasons behind them. The letter emphasized understanding the difficulty and helplessness of her husband being caught in the middle, expressed her longing for him, and outlined a vision for the future. This letter deeply inspired Ms. C, and the day after it was sent, her husband contacted her by phone. \n\nThird, building self-esteem. The two instances of emotional neglect had already caused significant psychological trauma to Ms. C. During the emotional repair process, the counselor sensed her pervasive panic. Therefore, they established the goal of \"repairing with dignity\" from the beginning. Throughout the process, the counselor used psychological counseling techniques to help Ms. C gradually regain self-esteem and self-love. Ms. C's willpower grew in three aspects: first, she was willing to admit her mistakes and correct them; second, she valued her marriage and was willing to put in her utmost sincerity to repair it; third, when faced with emotional and dignity issues, she prioritized the latter. Fourth, addressing the mother-in-law relationship. With the counselor's help, Ms. C's husband took the initiative to invite her and their daughter back home, and their spousal and mother-in-law relationships temporarily stabilized. However, later on, the husband's decision to buy a house and invest in Ms. C's family home triggered a crisis in his relationship with his mother, which subsequently led to a crisis in the mother-in-law relationship. Ms. C felt a deep sense of despair regarding her relationship with her mother-in-law, believing that there was an insurmountable barrier between them, and that any problems ultimately fell on her shoulders. She was also disappointed with her husband for avoiding problems, lacking assertiveness. The counselor used the \"Five-dimensional Emotion\" theory to help Ms. C develop a constructive understanding of family relationships, realizing that she and her husband should be at the center, together as a whole. Through psychoanalytic methods and theories regarding the complex dynamics with Chinese mothers-in-law, the counselor provided an in-depth analysis of the mother-in-law issue, teaching Ms. C to adopt a very open mindset towards her mother-in-law. \n\nSixth, enhancing creative capacity. Initially, the counselor indeed guided Ms. C through many communication techniques and even stepped in for her at critical moments. However, once the relationship stabilized, the counselor focused more on enlightening and engaging in dialogue with Ms. C, adopting a non-directive communication approach centered on her—encouraging her to gain self-awareness and authenticity. Notably, in the later stages of counseling, Ms. C began to show increasing creative thinking, not only changing her submissive attitude but also learning to view current issues from a long-term perspective. More importantly, when her sister-in-law attempted to confront them, Ms. C no longer exhibited the initial panic and weakness. She demonstrated mature autonomy in three ways: first, firmly standing by her husband; second, approaching her sister-in-law and mother-in-law with a very accommodating attitude; and third, no longer relying on the counselor's help, confidently taking on the responsibility of addressing issues on her own!"], "experience_and_reflection": "In the journey of psychotherapy, the essence lies in nurturing a transformative experience that enables clients to rediscover their inner resilience and navigate life's complexities with renewed vigor. Reflecting on the case of Ms. C, the intricate dynamics of her familial relationships offer a profound learning opportunity. This case underscores the importance of addressing immediate crises while fostering long-term personal growth, a delicate balance that requires both strategic intervention and empathetic understanding.\n\nThe initial phase of my work with Ms. C was dominated by an urgent need to stabilize her marriage, which was teetering on the edge of dissolution due to the strained relationship between her and her mother-in-law. This familial discord had a domino effect, creating a rift between Ms. C and her husband, who was caught in a web of conflicting loyalties. In such scenarios, it's crucial to address the pressing issues that threaten to unravel the fabric of the client's life. However, one must also keep sight of the broader therapeutic goal: empowering the client to develop self-efficacy and resilience.\n\nMs. C's situation was further complicated by her inherent pride and stubbornness, traits often exacerbated by her position as an only child who had previously enjoyed a dominant role in her marriage. The clash of wills between Ms. C and her assertive mother-in-law was inevitable, with both women accustomed to being at the helm within their respective domains. In this charged environment, her husband's lack of assertiveness became a critical factor, as he oscillated between his wife's needs and his mother's expectations. This triangulation is a common feature in familial conflicts, where the central figure struggles to mediate between two powerful forces.\n\nIn the therapeutic setting, it was paramount to help Ms. C recognize the duality of her emotional responses: her initial arrogance and later vulnerability. This awareness was crucial for her personal growth, as it highlighted the need to develop a more nuanced understanding of her emotional landscape. The psychoanalytic approach provided a framework to explore these underlying dynamics, enabling Ms. C to identify patterns in her behavior that contributed to the conflict. By integrating cognitive therapy techniques, I was able to assist her in reframing her perceptions and developing healthier coping strategies.\n\nA pivotal aspect of the therapeutic process was fostering Ms. C's self-esteem, which had been severely undermined by her experiences of emotional neglect. Building self-esteem is not merely about restoring a sense of worth but also about empowering clients to take proactive steps in their lives. In Ms. C's case, this involved encouraging her to articulate her needs and boundaries within her marriage, a process that required both courage and vulnerability. The \"reflection letter\" served as a tangible expression of this newfound assertiveness, allowing her to communicate her emotions and aspirations to her husband in a constructive manner.\n\nThe concept of \"repairing with dignity\" became a guiding principle in our sessions, emphasizing the importance of preserving one's self-respect even in the face of adversity. This approach resonated deeply with Ms. C, who began to understand that true strength lies not in dominance but in the ability to adapt and grow. The systematic desensitization technique was particularly effective in helping her manage the anxiety associated with familial interactions, gradually building her confidence in handling these challenging dynamics.\n\nAn integral part of the therapeutic journey involved addressing the mother-in-law relationship, a source of ongoing tension for Ms. C. Utilizing the Five-dimensional Emotion theory, we explored the complex emotional interdependencies within her family. This theoretical framework provided Ms. C with a deeper understanding of the relational dynamics at play, enabling her to view her mother-in-law not as an adversary but as a participant in a larger family system. By adopting an open mindset and practicing empathy, Ms. C was able to de-escalate conflicts and foster a more harmonious familial environment.\n\nThe transition from direct intervention to a client-centered approach marked a significant milestone in Ms. C's journey. As the immediate crisis abated, the focus shifted towards cultivating her creative capacity and fostering a sense of autonomy. Encouraging Ms. C to engage in self-reflection and explore her values was crucial in helping her develop a more authentic sense of self. This shift was evident in her interactions with her sister-in-law, where she demonstrated newfound maturity and independence, handling conflicts with grace and composure.\n\nReflecting on this case, it becomes evident that the role of a therapist is multifaceted, requiring a delicate balance between providing immediate relief and facilitating long-term growth. The adage \"helping people help themselves\" serves as a guiding principle, yet it must be tempered with pragmatism and sensitivity to the client's current realities. In situations like Ms. C's, where the stakes are high and the emotional terrain is fraught with challenges, it is essential to adopt a flexible approach that prioritizes the client's immediate needs while laying the groundwork for sustainable change.\n\nIn conclusion, the therapeutic journey with Ms. C reinforced the importance of an integrative approach that combines psychoanalytic insights with cognitive-behavioral strategies and client-centered techniques. By addressing both the immediate and underlying issues, we were able to facilitate a process of healing and growth that empowered Ms. C to reclaim her life with confidence and clarity. This case serves as a testament to the transformative power of psychotherapy, highlighting the profound impact of a compassionate and nuanced approach to healing.", "causes": "Tension between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law led to conflict between husband and wife, and the crisis was exacerbated by the husband's change in attitude.", "symptoms": "Ms. C is anxious and negative, her self-esteem is damaged, she has emotional trauma, and her relationship with her husband is deteriorating.", "treatment_process": "analyze the problem and develop strategies to improve confidence; provide support and guide the dialogue; rebuild self-esteem and deal with the relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law; and enhance creativity and autonomy at a later stage.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Severe psychological trauma, damaged self-esteem, interaction between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law conflicts and husband's attitude change.", "treatment_effect": "Ms. C's psychological trauma and anxiety were relieved, her self-esteem was gradually restored, progress was made in relationship repair, she was able to take the initiative to solve problems, and she showed maturity and self-confidence."}

I asked his father for confirmation, and he said he didn't notice any change. The child mentioned that his mother also noticed the change in his face.", "Secondly, the child said that their learning state has improved increasingly, and they no longer get tangled up with exam scores, facing them with ease. Tests are a way to see the knowledge they haven't mastered. As long as they put in the effort, they will definitely do better next time! What's particularly amazing is that in math class, there are no more negative feelings. It feels like they've regained the comfortable and enjoyable feeling of attending math class in elementary school. During tests, it's especially easy to find breakthroughs and inspiration, so their math scores have been consistently improving, surpassing many benchmarks they wanted to catch up to. They have enjoyed the joy of success. Their confidence has grown, and they naturally feel closer to particularly outstanding classmates.", "Third, the child said that in the past, they felt a vague and confused sense about life and the future, studying just for the sake of studying, leaving them feeling dizzy and overwhelmed after a day of learning. Now, having developed their own thoughts, they enjoy learning. Whether in elementary school, middle school, or university, they see these as small hills, as small goals, rather than life goals. Therefore, they have a stable viewpoint when facing all matters. This feeling is very wonderful, and they will not easily deny their own ideas. As a result, their essay scores have also improved. In the past, when writing essays, they often doubted their true thoughts, which made their writing unclear and rushed. This time, they wrote entirely according to their own thinking and achieved a high score.", "Fourth, I used to hardly go out on weekends, even after finishing my homework, I would enter a state of doing nothing and be uninterested in other activities. Now, I can arrange my time freely and comfortably. When faced with a math problem that I can't solve immediately, I have the ability to let it go. I no longer work hard blindly; I also go out to play with classmates and arrange my study time for other subjects more reasonably.", "Fifth, after this guidance, when it comes to mom, Xiaoyun somewhat disagrees with her frequently asking about the children's homework. I suggested to the parents to conduct an experiment for two weeks where they would completely refrain from inquiring about study matters, including waking them up, attending classes, homework, and related issues. Even in the face of challenges, they should insist that the children solve problems on their own. Both the parents and the children readily accepted the suggestion. We look forward to seeing greater miracles happen. In this part, the parents expressed some concerns about whether the children could manage the balance between studying and playing well. I mentioned that before finding Teacher Zong, I was worried about the child being overwhelmed by homework and textbooks. Now that Xiaoyun is relaxed and comfortable, the parents are worried that the child isn't putting in enough effort and that their studies may decline. The father laughed and said that parents really do overthink things...", "Through the first three sessions of guidance, we have addressed the factors of the child's inner gloom, headaches, and distress. This time, the focus will be entirely on growth psychological energy. It is divided into two parts: first, when the child shares the joy of success, their eyes radiate a confident glow.", "Second, using hypnosis to grow the tree of life, with mom and dad participating throughout. Walking on the vast grasslands, the child saw Xiaoxiao, the good friend met during the trip. After a warm hug, Xiaoxiao introduced her situation: studying easily, excelling in all subjects, and becoming the best student. After expressing this, she asked Xiaoyun how she felt. Xiaoyun hesitated for a moment and said she was happy for her good friend Xiaoxiao, who was so outstanding. Xiaoyun then introduced her own situation. When she first entered middle school, she encountered difficulties in math, but fortunately, her English grades were good, which kept her confidence from dropping too quickly. There were many excellent students whom she admired and even looked up to. She was afraid of poor grades and that her classmates would look down on her. However, through her own efforts, she continuously adjusted her mindset. Now, the confident and cheerful Xiaoyun is back. She no longer struggles with others' opinions, but firmly believes in herself, finds a way to study easily, and believes that tomorrow will be even better. As a result, her grades have improved from catching up to surpassing, and she is very happy.", "Little Wen Dao said, \"I'm very curious, how did you do it?\" Xiao Yun smiled broadly and said, \"Thank you, Teacher Zong, for your help in helping me regain my own confidence and happiness. I also want to thank my parents for their support, companionship, and encouragement. Thank you to the school teachers for their care and attention, to my classmates for their help, and to everyone in my life who has helped me.\"", "A little curious question: what have you done during your growth process? Xiaoyun said, I also have to thank my unyielding spirit, not settling for mediocrity, and not wanting to be someone looked down upon.", "Xiao Xiao saw Xiao Yun being so confident, sunny, and generous, and couldn't help but show a look of envy and admiration, saying, \"You have such wonderful parents and such a great teacher; it's really so delightful!\"", "As the sun sets in the west, the grassland is peaceful and serene. Two little friends lie on the grass, hand in hand, with the moonlight like water and stars twinkling above. Everyone has a lucky star, and everyone can feel the messages brought by their lucky star. Xiaoyun's lucky star says that as long as you have dreams and take action towards those dreams, you will surely reap success and happiness. Whether you enjoy dancing, painting, or writing, it will all be wonderful. I believe you will succeed. The little lucky star says that no matter what kind of person you become in the future, you will be safe, comfortable, and happy, doing the things you want to do.", "With this feeling, the two little friends sweetly fell asleep. In their dreams, they saw a spring morning on a grassland, where horses were running, cows were plowing the fields, and farmers were working—a scene full of vitality and energy. The child took out seeds, scattered them on the ground, watered and fertilized them, watching them grow strong. They grew into a towering tree, saying to Xiaoyun, \"Thank you for your help, I have grown up. I am you, and you are me. I have grown, and you have grown too. I am a confident and sunny tree, and you are a sunny and confident girl. We are both the best.\" Xiaoyun replied, \"Yes, we have both grown. I want to do what my heart desires and realize my dreams. I don't have to be a pillar of society.\" The tree said, \"You are so confident, sunny, happy, and wise; perhaps you could become a pillar of society.\" Xiaoyun interrupted the tree, \"No, being a pillar of society isn't the only way to be valuable. If someone becomes a writer and produces good books that contribute to society, that is also wonderful.\" Xiaoyun smiled and continued, \"Of course, it could be another kind of pillar.\" The tree said, \"Exactly, using your own strength to help more readers and serve society is also valuable; that is another kind of pillar...\"", "With ample energy and a fulfilled heart, we walked out of the hypnosis. Xiaoyun said that when it was time to leave, she truly felt reluctant and wanted to say a few more words to the big tree. I had Xiaoyun move her limbs and stretch her joints. Xiaoyun exclaimed in surprise that her shoulders no longer hurt and her arms weren't sore anymore. This was an unexpected gain; I had never known that the child had been troubled by shoulder pain during this time. It seems that certain repressed emotions can be stored in the body. Perhaps using psychological methods to address physical discomfort can open another door.", "(In the same location, on the same afternoon during a previous girl's counseling session, the focus was on addressing a high school girl's emotional distress related to shoulder and back muscle pain. After hypnosis, the pain was reduced by 40%.)"], "consultation_process": ["Share growth experiences, allowing parents and children to see each other, nurturing the tree of life and replenishing life energy."], "experience_and_reflection": "The journey with Xiaoyun has been a profound exploration into the intricate interplay between psychological growth, familial dynamics, and personal resilience. Reflecting on Xiaoyun's case, I am struck by the remarkable transformation she underwent and the various factors contributing to her newfound confidence and joy. Initially, Xiaoyun's challenges stemmed from a sense of burden due to her family's investment in her physical health, compounded by her own high expectations of academic performance. These pressures manifested in ways that hindered her cognitive and emotional development, creating a cycle of guilt and stress that was difficult to break.\n\nXiaoyun's sense of guilt was deeply rooted in her awareness of the financial and emotional sacrifices her family made for her health. This guilt was not merely a passing feeling; it was a profound, almost existential burden that she carried with her daily. The hypnotherapy sessions played a crucial role in addressing these emotional undercurrents. By creating a safe space for Xiaoyun to explore her feelings, we began to untangle the complex emotions that were affecting her wellbeing. The visualization exercises, particularly the nurturing of the 'tree of life,' provided a metaphorical framework through which Xiaoyun could project her growth and potential, separate from the guilt and pressure she felt.\n\nOne of the most striking developments was Xiaoyun's shift in perspective regarding her academic performance. Initially, her achievements were a means of repaying her parents, a tangible way of expressing gratitude and justifying the sacrifices they made. This transactional view of education, while initially motivating, eventually became a source of significant stress. Through our sessions, we worked on reframing Xiaoyun's relationship with learning. By viewing education as a series of small, manageable goals rather than life-defining milestones, Xiaoyun was able to rediscover the joy in learning. This reframing was not just about reducing pressure but also about fostering a genuine passion for knowledge, which in turn led to improved academic performance and self-esteem.\n\nThe improvement in Xiaoyun's math skills, for instance, was emblematic of this transformation. By alleviating the negative emotions associated with failure and repositioning challenges as opportunities for growth, Xiaoyun was able to excel in subjects that previously intimidated her. Her newfound confidence in math was mirrored in her approach to life more broadly; she became more resilient and less affected by the opinions of others. This resilience was cultivated through a combination of hypnotherapy and supportive guidance from her family and educators, who played a pivotal role in reinforcing the positive changes she was experiencing.\n\nIn addition to her academic and emotional growth, Xiaoyun's social interactions also evolved. As she gained confidence, she naturally gravitated towards peers who inspired her, and in turn, she became a source of inspiration to others. Her story underscores the importance of a supportive social network in the development of a child's self-concept and the ability to navigate social dynamics with grace and assurance.\n\nReflecting on the role of Xiaoyun's parents, it is clear that their involvement was both a blessing and a challenge. Their concern for her wellbeing sometimes manifested as over-involvement, particularly regarding her studies. However, their willingness to step back and allow Xiaoyun to manage her own academic responsibilities was a crucial turning point. This shift empowered Xiaoyun, giving her the autonomy to balance her studies with leisure, thereby fostering a healthier, more sustainable approach to education and personal development.\n\nThe hypnotherapy sessions were instrumental in facilitating these changes, serving as a conduit for Xiaoyun to access her inner strength and wisdom. The imaginative landscapes and dialogues created during these sessions allowed Xiaoyun to visualize her potential and articulate her desires in a way that felt authentic and empowering. The metaphor of the 'lucky star' resonated deeply with her, encapsulating the idea that success and happiness are achievable through self-belief and determination.\n\nFurthermore, the physical aspect of Xiaoyun's transformation, such as the alleviation of her shoulder pain, highlighted the interconnectedness of mind and body. The psychosomatic relief experienced through hypnotherapy suggests that emotional healing can lead to tangible physical benefits. This revelation opens up new avenues for therapeutic intervention, emphasizing the need for holistic approaches that address both psychological and physiological aspects of a client's experience.\n\nIn conclusion, Xiaoyun's case is a testament to the transformative power of psychotherapy when it is tailored to the unique needs and circumstances of the individual. Her journey from a state of pressure and guilt to one of confidence and joy underscores the importance of addressing underlying emotional barriers and fostering an environment of support and understanding. As a clinician, this experience has reinforced my belief in the potential for growth and healing inherent in every individual, provided they are given the right tools and support to navigate their challenges.

When we started dating, he was in his first year of graduate school. He has an older sister who called him to invite me to dinner. I told him that I was too busy with work and couldn't go. To be honest, I wasn't sure if we would succeed as a couple, so I didn't want to casually accept a meal from him, fearing it would make future meetings awkward. At that time, my mother-in-law thought I was being aloof and hard to invite, but I really didn't think of it that way.", "When we were in love, we were like other couples, having meals, watching movies, and sharing our hearts. Sometimes he would treat me to dinner, but I felt embarrassed at the time, so I got a movie card and treated us to movies. If we didn't watch movies, we would just walk and chat, talking about life and discussing our dreams. We could walk for three to four hours. From our conversations, I felt he was an ambitious young man. Although his family didn't have much money, he understood that he had to rely on his own efforts while in college. Later, he spent a year preparing and got into graduate school! He also loved his mother very much. He told me about the hardships she faced. When he was a teenager, his father opened a bathhouse, but it later went out of business, and his father had an affair. At that time, he hated his father and even fought with him. My husband was very miserable during that period; he would come home from school to find there was no hot meal waiting for him.", "At that time, I felt that my mother-in-law had a hard life, and my husband was also a very pitiful person. Not long after, we got an electric scooter, and he would ride it to take me to work and pick me up after work; that was our sweetest time. Even his mother thought he wasn't very bright. The first time I went to his house to meet his parents, the first question his mother asked me was whether I had a rural or urban household registration, and I said I was from a town.", "His parents have always had the mindset that their son is an exceptionally outstanding graduate student, and they feel that finding him is a blessing for me.

My husband said to his parents, \"You have no right to decide my marriage. Mom, I hate you!\"", "Later, his mother cried for a long time and eventually agreed.", "Later, he went with his dad to look for houses to buy. They found a second-hand house that is very close to my mother-in-law's place, saying it would be convenient for taking care of her in the future. Later, he asked me, and I said it was quite good; buying second-hand saves on renovations. Eventually, they paid the full price of 800,000, most of which was earned by my mother-in-law. The property certificate was issued in my husband's name.", "My mother-in-law actually has a tough life.

My father-in-law is someone who enjoys playing around and doesn't have much sense of responsibility. The first conflict I had with my mother-in-law was over registering my household. I wanted to move my household registration to where we live because I was getting married, but my mother-in-law disagreed and wanted me to register at their place, saying that with more people, there would be more compensation when they relocate. However, I believed that their place wouldn’t be demolished, so she stubbornly refused to agree, and in the end, I didn't move my registration there.", "When I got married, my parents accompanied me with a car. Since we got a car, it has been our responsibility to pick up and drop off grandma, grandpa, and great-grandma for meals. It snowed before the New Year, and the roads were icy.

He doesn't understand anything about life and can't do housework, so I usually teach him a bit. Therefore, I am quite strong-willed in this regard.

Before the New Year, when my mother-in-law came to visit us, she mentioned in our conversation that she wanted to borrow 100,000 yuan from us, saying that the place she lived in had no sunlight and it would be difficult to take care of a baby in the future, and that all the neighbors had moved away, leaving just them there. Later, I said we didn't have that much money, and my mother-in-law helped us calculate our expenses, saying that for the past two years, we had eaten her food, and asked where the money had gone.

It also dares to take responsibility for the corresponding choices."], "experience_and_reflection": "Reflecting on this case, we delve into the complex dynamics that can often arise in marital relationships and the intricate web of interactions between spouses and their extended families. The challenges Kitten faces are emblematic of broader issues many couples encounter, especially in cases where familial expectations and personal boundaries clash. At the heart of this situation is a confluence of emotional, relational, and familial factors that have led to significant distress.\n\nFirstly, understanding the familial context is crucial. Kitten's husband comes from a background marked by economic hardships and family strife, particularly concerning his parents' tumultuous relationship. These early experiences likely shaped his perceptions of marriage and familial obligations. His mother's struggles and his father's irresponsibility may have instilled in him a sense of duty towards his mother, which seems to have persisted into his adult life. This sense of duty is not uncommon in individuals who witness parental hardship, as they often feel compelled to compensate or protect the vulnerable parent. Consequently, his decision to purchase a house close to his mother's residence, ostensibly for her care, underscores this deep-rooted sense of responsibility and perhaps an unresolved need to prove his worthiness as a son.\n\nKitten, on the other hand, entered this relationship with her own set of expectations and values, which were not entirely aligned with those of her husband's family. Her initial reluctance to meet his family and her later conflicts over issues like household registration reflect a desire to maintain her autonomy and assert her identity within the marriage. Her background and her journey towards independence likely fostered a strong sense of self-reliance, which sometimes clashed with the expectations placed upon her by her in-laws. This tension is further exacerbated by her in-laws' perception of their son as a high-achieving individual who deserves a partner matching their aspirations for him.\n\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) provides a useful framework for dissecting these interactions. By analyzing the thought patterns and beliefs held by Kitten and her husband, we can identify cognitive distortions that contribute to their marital discord. Kitten's perception of her mother-in-law as controlling and domineering reflects a cognitive label that influences her emotional response and behavior. Similarly, her mother-in-law's belief that Kitten manages finances in a way that undermines her son's dignity highlights a fundamental misalignment in values and expectations. These perceptions have been reinforced over time through interactions characterized by conflict and miscommunication.\n\nTo move forward, it is imperative that Kitten reassesses her internal labels and beliefs. By cultivating a more objective and compassionate understanding of her mother-in-law's actions—recognizing them as motivated by concern for her son's welfare rather than malice—Kitten can begin to shift her emotional response. This reframing process requires acknowledging the underlying anxieties and fears both she and her mother-in-law face, particularly regarding the pressures to conform to traditional roles and expectations within the family.\n\nAnother pivotal aspect is the role of communication. Kitten's marriage has suffered from a lack of effective communication, where grievances and frustrations are often left unaddressed or expressed through arguments rather than constructive dialogue. Enhancing communication skills, particularly active listening and assertiveness, can help Kitten and her husband better articulate their needs and concerns. This involves not only expressing one's own feelings and needs but also genuinely understanding and acknowledging the other's perspective. For Kitten, this may mean addressing her husband's familial obligations with empathy, while also clearly communicating her own needs and boundaries.\n\nThe issue of financial management is another critical area that requires attention. Kitten's responsibility for managing household finances, coupled with her mother-in-law's perception of her as controlling, has contributed to tension and resentment. By fostering transparency and collaboration in financial matters, Kitten and her husband can alleviate some of the pressure and misunderstandings that arise from financial decisions. This process involves setting shared goals and priorities, and regularly reviewing their financial situation together. It also necessitates a mutual understanding of each other's financial philosophies and the impact of external pressures, such as familial expectations or societal norms.\n\nMoreover, the psychological impact of Kitten's miscarriage cannot be overlooked. The emotional toll of losing a pregnancy, compounded by her husband's reaction and the perceived insensitivity of her mother-in-law, has undoubtedly affected Kitten's emotional well-being. Addressing this trauma requires a sensitive and supportive approach, where Kitten can process her grief and explore her feelings about motherhood and future family planning. It is crucial that her husband provides emotional support during this time, reaffirming their shared goals and commitment to their relationship, regardless of external pressures to have children.\n\nKitten's reflections on independence and self-reliance are also worth examining. While these traits have served her well professionally, they may have inadvertently contributed to a dynamic where she feels solely responsible for managing the marriage and household, leaving her husband disengaged from these responsibilities. Encouraging a partnership approach, where both parties share responsibilities and contribute to decision-making, can foster a healthier balance and reduce feelings of isolation or resentment.\n\nFinally, it is essential to consider the broader societal and cultural influences at play. Kitten and her husband are navigating a landscape where traditional familial roles and expectations are evolving, yet still hold significant sway. This tension between modernity and tradition can create conflict, especially in marriages where the partners come from differing backgrounds or hold divergent views on these roles. By addressing these influences and fostering a dialogue that respects both individual autonomy and familial obligations, Kitten and her husband can work towards a more harmonious and fulfilling relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, Kitten's case is a poignant reminder of the complexities inherent in marital relationships, particularly those influenced by familial dynamics and societal expectations. Through a process of reframing, enhanced communication, shared responsibility, and cultural sensitivity, Kitten and her husband can navigate these challenges and work towards a more resilient and supportive partnership.

{"id": 194, "case_description": ["The help seeker is a 13-year-old girl in the sixth grade of elementary school. When she was younger, her parents often fought and argued. Her mother frequently went to her grandmother's house and even ran away from home at one point. The help seeker had difficulty walking as a child, and her mother asked family members to take her to the hospital, but her grandmother and father not only disagreed but also often scolded her mother. The help seeker's father was irresponsible and later incurred a lot of debt, which contributed to the parents' divorce. When she was in the fourth grade, her aunt took her to Beijing for treatment, where it was discovered that she had mild cerebral palsy. From that point on, she felt that the world was very unfair to her. According to the doctor's advice, she needed rehabilitation training, but due to her emotional imbalance and the lack of concern from her parents and family, she did not persist with the rehabilitation training. Now, more than two years later, her physical condition has not improved significantly. Later, her father became addicted to drugs and left their hometown, leaving her mother to take care of her and her younger sister alone, which put a lot of economic pressure on her and led to a lack of care for the help seeker. Other family members also did not provide support. At school, because of her physical disability, she was often looked down upon and bullied by her classmates. Gradually, she became undisciplined and her academic performance declined significantly. She believes that her misfortune is caused by her family and harbors deep resentment towards all of them. She is unsure about what to do in the future and has come for consultation."], "consultation_process": ["Consultation process: When the seeker arrived, they were quite agitated and indignant.", "Psychological counselor: I am a psychological counselor and can understand your feelings.

My academic performance is also poor right now.", "Psychological Counselor: Child, if the teacher hopes you will study hard and improve your academic performance, are you willing to put in the effort?", "Helper: Can I speak honestly?", "Psychological counselor: Thank you for trusting the teacher; feel free to express your thoughts as you wish.", "Seeker: I currently have no interest in studying at all. People say that when God closes a door, He opens a window for you, but I feel that God has closed a door for me and hasn’t opened a window.", "Psychological counselor: If you have no interest in studying, have you thought about your future? What is your positioning for yourself in the future? Or what do you hope to do in the future? Can you tell me what you are interested in?", "Seeker: I'm quite interested in anime! Since there's no one around me to keep me company, I only have cartoons. I'm also quite happy with my art; I'm learning it now.", "Psychological Counselor: It's good that you are interested in anime. If you can make progress in anime design, your future will be bright. However, to achieve something in this area, you need a solid foundation in anime theory, and you will need to study these theories at university. Are you willing to put in the effort?", "Helper: If it's just drawing, I can still put in the effort. My art grades have always been above 80 or 90, but I never learned English well, and now my score has dropped to just over ten. I don't know if I can catch up, and my leg is also an obstacle for me.", "Psychological counselor: You like fine arts and anime, which is great. However, if you don't study the relevant theories, it will be difficult for you to take your artwork or anime design to the next level. To achieve success in this area in the future, you need to build a solid foundation in cultural subjects, and you must go to university.", "Helper: Can I still catch up on my cultural classes? Also, my leg—my mom says it should get better with exercise, but I really don't want to exercise at all right now. The most important thing is that I have no willpower.", "Psychological counselor: Your legs are inconvenient, but in the future, you can work sitting down in fields like art and animation, so the impact isn't very significant. The teacher just hopes you have a sunny disposition. Strengthening your exercise will help improve your health as much as possible.

Put this plan on the wall above your bed or desk, and make a chart for yourself with the dates marked. Each day you complete your exercise, ask your mom to give you a red star.

The teacher feels very happy. They may have their own difficulties as well, and you are a sensible child. No one can choose their background, and the teacher hopes you can let go of your unhappiness and become a child with a sunny disposition, being the best version of yourself.", "Helper: Okay, thank you, teacher!"], "experience_and_reflection": "The growth of a child is intricately woven with the threads of parental companionship and familial support, both of which play pivotal roles in shaping a child's developmental trajectory. In reflecting upon this case, it becomes evident that a stable and nurturing family environment is not merely beneficial but crucial for the healthy development of a child. A happy family acts as a buffer against the vicissitudes of life, offering a protective shield that fosters emotional resilience and psychological well-being.\n\nThis case highlights the unfortunate reality faced by many children who find themselves in tumultuous family environments. The help seeker, a 13-year-old girl, navigates a world that feels inherently unjust and hostile. Her experiences underscore the importance of timely medical intervention and consistent emotional support, especially for children with disabilities. Had she received prompt medical attention and continuous encouragement when her condition was first identified, her physical health might have improved, and her emotional well-being might have been more stable.\n\nThe absence of a supportive family framework can lead to profound consequences for a child. In this case, the help seeker faced numerous adversities, including a lack of parental responsibility, economic hardships, and social ostracism. Her father's irresponsibility and subsequent descent into drug addiction compounded these difficulties, leaving her mother to shoulder the burden of raising two children with limited resources. This scenario is not uncommon in families where financial strain and substance abuse coexist, creating a cycle of neglect and resentment.\n\nDespite these challenges, the help seeker demonstrated remarkable resilience by recognizing her confusion and actively seeking psychological assistance. This proactive step is admirable and offers a glimmer of hope for her future. It illustrates the importance of accessible mental health services for young individuals, particularly those who feel isolated and unsupported. Providing a safe space for them to express their emotions and explore their interests can be transformative.\n\nThe consultation process reveals the complexity of the help seeker's situation. Her initial agitation and indignation are understandable, given her circumstances. The therapeutic approach employed by the psychological counselor emphasizes empathy, active listening, and encouragement, which are essential components of effective communication analysis. By validating the help seeker's feelings and exploring her interests, the counselor helps her to envision a future beyond her current struggles.\n\nThe discussion about the help seeker's interest in anime and art opens a pathway for her to pursue a passion that could potentially lead to a fulfilling career. However, it also highlights the need for academic achievement and perseverance. The counselor's emphasis on the importance of building a solid foundation in cultural subjects underscores the interconnectedness of education and personal aspirations. This aspect of the consultation is crucial, as it reinforces the notion that intellectual growth can coexist with creative pursuits.\n\nThe counselor also addresses the help seeker's concerns about her father's debts, providing reassurance and refocusing her attention on her own well-being and education. This intervention is vital, as it alleviates some of the undue burden placed on her shoulders and redirects her focus towards self-care and personal development. It is a reminder that children should not be made to bear the responsibilities of adults, particularly when it comes to financial matters that are beyond their control.\n\nOne of the most poignant aspects of this case is the help seeker's evolving perception of her family. Initially, she expresses hatred and resentment towards them, which gradually shifts to a less intense dislike. This change, though subtle, signifies the beginning of an emotional transformation. The counselor's gentle guidance encourages her to consider the possibility that her family members may have their own struggles and limitations. This perspective fosters empathy and may eventually lead to reconciliation and healing.\n\nIn reflecting upon the broader implications of this case, it is imperative to acknowledge the systemic issues that contribute to such familial dysfunction. Economic instability, lack of access to healthcare, and inadequate social support systems are pervasive challenges that exacerbate familial tensions and hinder a child's development. Addressing these issues requires a multi-faceted approach involving policy changes, community support, and increased awareness of mental health and disability rights.\n\nThe case also serves as a call to action for parents and caregivers to fulfill their responsibilities towards their children. Parenting is a profound responsibility that extends beyond providing basic necessities; it encompasses nurturing a child's emotional, psychological, and social development. For children with disabilities, this responsibility is even greater, as they require additional care and attention to thrive.\n\nIn conclusion, this case reflection offers valuable insights into the complexities of parent-child relationships and the critical role of familial support in a child's development. It underscores the necessity of timely medical intervention, consistent emotional support, and accessible mental health services for children facing adversities. The help seeker's journey, marked by resilience and a desire for a better future, is a testament to the human spirit's capacity to overcome challenges and seek positive change. As clinicians, educators, and caregivers, we must strive to create environments that foster growth, healing, and hope for all children. May this reflection inspire a renewed commitment to supporting the well-being of our young ones, ensuring that they are not only seen and heard but also cherished and nurtured.", "causes": "poor family environment, divorced parents, father's drug addiction and debt, family neglect, and her own mild cerebral palsy.", "symptoms": "Resentment towards family members, emotional imbalance, academic decline, lack of perseverance in physical rehabilitation.", "treatment_process": "The counselor used communication analysis, empathic listening, guided him to face his emotions, explored his interest in animation, encouraged his studies and rehabilitation exercises, and helped him plan for his future.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Physical mild cerebral palsy has not improved, psychological full of resentment, no interest in learning, confused about the future.", "treatment_effect": "attitude softened, from hating his family to only disliking them, willingness to accept counseling suggestions."}

I am now choosing between pursuing a Ph.D. abroad or focusing on sales for in-depth discussion. Boss: a scholar going into business. Doctoral supervisor: XNY industry international authority. Sales agent: achieving financial freedom in a short time. Other issues: how to get along with other executives. Relationship with girlfriend."], "consultation_process": ["The first consultation involved open and honest communication, leading to a clear understanding of the decision-making evaluation model for the case. In the second consultation, we delved deeper into some aspects of the case that were not fully grasped or understood. By the third consultation, significant decisions had been made, securing a position for overseas doctoral studies and preparing for market development. We addressed numerous uncertainties related to market expansion and business management. You focused on listening while quickly identifying the root causes and essence of the issues! The individual in the case hopes to balance being a technical expert with sales, clearly leaning towards the former, but why seek consultation? They want to seize the lucrative opportunities in the emerging XNY industry to quickly achieve financial freedom, while also wishing to continue deepening their expertise in this field and become a technical expert. Experts can find opportunities everywhere: in companies, academic institutions, and among officials. The two different paths—business management and technical expertise—need to be combined, especially during this period, to showcase a comprehensive ability as a high-quality talent, demonstrating accurate judgment, problem-solving skills, and public relations abilities, among others. \n\n1. Understand personal value orientation—become a technical expert! Pursue further studies abroad: learn from top international professors in the industry. Understand the boss's intentions and one’s own perspective: as a sales agent, the goal is to earn money and achieve financial freedom in a short time. The prospects and challenges of being a sales agent were not articulated very clearly! There are misconceptions and blind spots in understanding. Having a clear value system allows for a win-win situation! It’s an excellent opportunity to work with a well-regarded boss and mentor, entering a promising industry—cherish it! \n   Interests: aspiring to be a technical expert; the \"only\" opportunity to pursue a doctorate with a renowned professor; rapid company growth opportunities leading to short-term financial freedom; \n   Obstacles: pursuing a doctorate requires going abroad that year; the boss wants to arrange for the establishment of a regional sales company. Self-assessment: abilities, personality, interests, opportunities (both created and potential), relationship management, and benefit trade-offs. It’s essential to recognize current shortcomings and evaluate one’s abilities (market development, communication, technical skills, etc.). The shortcomings are evident, while strengths have yet to be highlighted. For example, sales can be tough! They don’t even know how to create a budget for starting a sales company, how many people to hire, or what kind of people to recruit, despite studying business for their master's degree. They are concerned about how to calculate agency fees and how much commission to propose to the company.\n\n2. From stakeholders: 1) The boss—understand the quality of the relationship with the founder and the boss's expectations. The company urgently needs performance support to attract more investors, and the boss has taken them out to build connections and personally handle sales. They are tasked with establishing a sales agency to solidify the foundation and ensure that customer relationships are managed by key personnel. They seem to have to follow the boss's instructions. To stabilize the company/industry, sales is the best training! —Clarify the boss's intentions and take initiative; this is not the time to be picky. Everyone knows that quick results must be produced to circle the market (clients) and demonstrate value to investors. How to truly become a capable leader relies on performance/results. ✔ There is a significant amount of negotiation space! There is considerable flexibility in the location selection, establishment, and management of the sales agency, as well as in work hours (freedom!). \n   2) The mentor—obstacle: no more doctoral students will be accepted next year; interest: the vast Chinese XNY market; to effectively convert research results, it is essential to build good relationships before even entering the program, actively communicate, and not just send resumes or fill out application forms. Professors abroad pay close attention to valuable emails! ✔ There is a suggestion to leverage public relations to alter the decision on the timing of further studies. \n   3) Others, including the girlfriend's relationship and connections with other senior company executives. Their relationships with the two vice presidents of the company are average. Although they are a founder, they are just an assistant to the boss, while the core figures are the boss, a technical expert, and a vice president responsible for sales. ✔ Recognize the responsibilities and obligations that come with being a senior executive in a company! This goes beyond merely discussing personal interests and rights. Properly understand and manage relationships with other core executives. ✔ When weighing decisions, one must not only consider personal interests but also understand how to align with the company's interests; otherwise, personal involvement in entrepreneurship becomes merely an experience rather than a success. ✔ Recognize one's value pursuit, acknowledging not only the sales shortcomings but also the potential weaknesses as a technical expert! (misconceptions, blind spots, pitfalls)."], "experience_and_reflection": "To summarize: Clarifying the key issues, identifying stakeholders, indicating direction, and enabling the individual to quickly grasp how to address the problem—that epitomizes effective career planning! Resources available to assist them are merely complementary enhancements. In many cases, particularly in situations where individuals seek guidance, the need for clarity and insight is paramount. This case presents four driving forces: misconceptions in sales performance, blind spots in relationships with senior executives, the fertile ground of a promising industry and supportive mentorship, and the rich opportunities for wealth creation within the company.\n\nMisconceptions around sales performance indicate a lack of understanding in how to establish a robust sales strategy. This reflects a common challenge for individuals transitioning from academic or technical backgrounds to commercial roles. Many, including our case subject, grapple with the nuances of sales management, budgeting, and recruiting the right talent. The gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application can often lead to underperformance or missed opportunities. Addressing these misconceptions involves developing a detailed understanding of market dynamics and customer needs. Our subject would benefit from targeted training and mentorship in these areas, allowing them to translate their technical expertise into compelling sales propositions.\n\nBlind spots in managing relationships with senior executives can undermine one’s ability to navigate corporate hierarchies effectively. The subject’s interactions with the two vice presidents reveal an average relationship, indicating a potential area for growth. As an assistant to the chairman, yet not a core figure in executive circles, our subject must cultivate a deeper understanding of organizational politics and interpersonal dynamics. Enhancing these relationships requires proactive communication, empathy, and strategic alignment with the executives’ goals. Through conscious effort in relationship-building and understanding others’ perspectives, the subject can strengthen their influence and collaboration within the company.\n\nThe third driving force, characterized as oil fields, symbolizes the abundant opportunities presented by the industry and mentorship. The XNY industry is burgeoning, with potential for significant growth and innovation. Our subject's position offers a unique vantage point to leverage these opportunities, particularly with the guidance of a well-regarded boss and a renowned doctoral supervisor. Engaging with this fertile environment requires an entrepreneurial mindset and openness to learning from diverse experiences. By embracing the mentorship available and actively seeking knowledge, the subject can position themselves as a pivotal player in the industry’s evolution.\n\nMineral fields represent the period's lucrative opportunities for wealth creation within the company. Achieving financial freedom is a common aspiration, yet it demands strategic foresight and effective decision-making. The subject must balance the immediate gains of sales roles with long-term career aspirations as a technical expert. This balance necessitates a comprehensive understanding of market trends, risk assessment, and strategic investment in personal and professional development. By aligning their career trajectory with the company’s growth, the subject can maximize their financial potential while securing their role as an industry leader.\n\nReflecting on these insights, successors of family businesses, despite holding advanced degrees, often find themselves needing to validate their capabilities through tangible results. The case demonstrates that academic accolades alone are insufficient in the corporate world. Performance and ability are the true currencies of success. Leaders must exhibit the four abilities—judgment, drive and intrinsic motivation, cohesion, and problem-solving effectiveness. This model not only applies to selecting corporate executives but also to assessing employees at all levels. A leader's value emerges not in routine tasks but in critical moments. Problem-solving effectiveness and a leader’s ability to influence outcomes determine their true merit.\n\nJudgment, as a core ability, involves structural and systematic thinking, execution capability, and a clear management vision. These skills are essential for senior executives who must articulate a vision, inspire teams, and take decisive action during pivotal moments. Effective leaders continuously communicate, internally and externally, aligning their teams with the broader organizational objectives. For our subject, honing judgment means developing a comprehensive understanding of both technical and commercial dimensions of their role, ensuring they can navigate complex business landscapes with confidence.\n\nDrive and intrinsic motivation are vital for sustained leadership success. These elements encompass interpersonal influence, clarity of thought, and management experience. Intrinsic motivation, the original driving force, propels individuals to overcome challenges and pursue excellence. Our subject must cultivate a mindset focused on growth and resilience, recognizing that their motivation impacts not only their success but also their ability to inspire and lead others.\n\nCohesion, the ability to foster teamwork and solve problems effectively, is critical in achieving organizational goals. Leaders must build cohesive teams that work collaboratively to address challenges. For our subject, this means developing a leadership style that values diverse perspectives, encourages open communication, and fosters a culture of trust and mutual support.\n\nIn conclusion, the journey of our subject in this case is one of balancing diverse opportunities and challenges, requiring a multifaceted approach to leadership and career development. By addressing misconceptions, overcoming blind spots, and leveraging the fertile opportunities within their industry, the subject can navigate their career path with strategic foresight and determination. The lessons from this case extend beyond the individual, offering valuable insights for anyone seeking to excel in dynamic and competitive environments.", "causes": "Confusion about career choice, internal uncertainty about the future and doubt about self-competence.", "symptoms": "Showing unfamiliarity with sales management, confusion in dealing with interpersonal relationships, as well as confusion and anxiety in the career path.", "treatment_process": "Through counseling, in-depth understanding of personal value orientation, analyzing the expectations and needs of stakeholders, helping them to recognize their own strengths and weaknesses, and gradually clarifying their career direction.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Typical career development confusion, accompanied by insufficient self-knowledge, confused career planning and a sense of powerlessness in dealing with interpersonal relationships.", "treatment_effect": "Finally made the decision to go abroad to study for a doctoral degree, and at the same time prepared to carry out market development work, enhanced confidence and clarity in career development."}

And you already have one; I actually envy you.", "Xuan looked up at the counselor, her eyes lit up for a moment, and she nodded.", "Counselor: Is it possible that among your friends in the fifth or sixth ring, there is one or two who could gradually move into the seventh or eighth ring? At the very least, these friends can accompany you at certain times and in certain aspects.

I stood up and cried, not because I felt ashamed, but because I felt sorry for my parents. After sitting down, I secretly cried for a long time; no one noticed that I was crying, and no one asked me what was wrong. At that time, I was very introverted and had no friends. Actually, I envy you quite a bit. Look, you have a friend in the tenth ring and quite a few friends in the fifth and sixth rings.\"", "Xuan looked up and said to the counselor: Yes, actually E is quite nice to me and really does care about me sometimes. He also took me to integrate into their circle; he has quite a few friends.", "Counselor: I still remember that you rated your current state a three or four. Is there a possibility to improve it by one or two points based on that?", "Xuan immediately replied: Yes.", "Counselor: What do you think you can do to possibly improve your score by one more point?", "Xuan mentioned several methods, such as finding certain teachers whose offices are quite close to the classroom, so during breaks, it's easy to go and have a quick chat. It used to be like that, but recently I haven't gone to see that teacher because she isn't teaching my class this year. However, I can also seek out other teachers that I like and think are good, many of whom also teach my subjects. During breaks, if someone calls out, I can join them for activities; if no one calls, I can go by myself and see if I can join in. Later, when I go to another dorm to find my friends, I don't pay attention to what others say; I just focus on what I need to do. After all, my friends treat me pretty well and have advised me not to care about what others say; that person just talks that way.", "Counselor: What else?", "Xuan: That's all I can think of.", "Counselor: I believe that through these methods, you can gradually improve your condition. Just as you mentioned, some methods you've used before are still effective, and there are also some new approaches. In fact, by sitting here today, you have already taken the first step towards a better state! Also, if you need, just make an appointment in advance, and I will be here waiting for you. What I say may not necessarily help you, but I will face all the problems with you and brainstorm solutions together until the issues are resolved, as long as you need.", "Xuan's eyes brightened: Thank you, teacher."], "experience_and_reflection": "Throughout the counseling process, the visitor, Xuan, spoke freely, pouring out years of words from the depths of his heart. The counselor, amidst the torrent of emotions, experienced the highs and lows together with him, sometimes riding the crest of the wave and sometimes falling into the depths. This vivid imagery of a small boat carrying a hundred years of solitude and helplessness of a young boy, rolling in the towering waves of the vast ocean, captured the emotional intensity of the sessions. At times, Xuan seemed to disappear from sight, as if he was drowning in his struggles. Just as the counselor was about to dive into the depths to rescue him, they saw him clinging desperately to the little boat, gasping for air and struggling for his life. In those moments, it felt like a race against time as a shark pursued him, a huge wave threatened to crash down, and hidden reefs loomed ahead. Yet, the counselor had to remain calm and composed, transforming into a splash of water that hit Xuan's face, startling him awake to the reality of his situation and potential for survival.\n\nThis metaphorical journey through the stormy seas of Xuan's inner world highlights the complexity and depth of his struggles. Throughout the consultation process, under the therapist's probing, Xuan described a multitude of complex issues in a deep and detailed manner. His family factors, growth experiences, and personality traits, combined with the environment in which he was raised, have all shaped who he is today. The therapist observed that Xuan had been struggling for over a decade, feeling increasingly helpless and trapped. As a minor, he was at a critical juncture where he could potentially break down at any moment.\n\nThe vastness and intricacy of Xuan's emotional landscape give a sense of being deeply rooted yet difficult to tackle, as if a major operation is needed to resolve the current predicament. In this situation, I held only one belief in my heart: Xuan must have the energy, ability, and potential to overcome all of this, turning misfortune into fortune and transforming adversity into good luck. He has come this far on his own and will continue to move forward. More importantly, he took the initiative to come to the counseling room, seeking a way out and solutions; he is eager to grow and strengthen himself. This is the power and miracle of life.\n\nUnder this belief, I maintained my composure from start to finish, being able to enter his heart and exit at the right moment, allowing my thoughts to remain clear while guiding him in a winding path toward the goal. Xuan presented various clinical aspects. I guided him, sometimes in front of him, sometimes alongside him, and sometimes behind him, leading, guiding, or inspiring him to navigate through the tangled appearances and find the ultimate issue that remains consistent amidst the chaos. Then, starting from the end of the problem, we traced back to find the goal and envisioned how to take the first step to get a little closer to that goal, and then encouraged him to take action.\n\nThe critical moment in the consultation came when we delved into the nature of Xuan's friendships and his sense of belonging. His dependency on friends for emotional support, the feeling of being marginalized, and his sensitivity to others' perceptions were all significant areas of focus. Xuan's narrative revealed a pattern of seeking validation and connection while grappling with an internal sense of inadequacy and rejection. His experience of feeling excluded, whether during military training or in the dormitory, reinforced his belief of not truly fitting in. This belief was compounded by the departure of his school friend A, which served as a catalyst for his current emotional state.\n\nAs we unpacked these layers, it became apparent that Xuan's sense of self-worth was heavily intertwined with external validation from his peers. This insight guided the therapeutic approach toward empowering Xuan to recognize his intrinsic value and potential beyond the immediate validation of friendships. The concept of the \"glass heart,\" a term used by his friends to describe his sensitivity, was reframed as a strength, highlighting his capacity for empathy and depth of feeling. This reframing aimed to shift Xuan's perspective from seeing his sensitivity as a weakness to embracing it as a unique and valuable aspect of his personality.\n\nThe SFBT (Solution-Focused Brief Therapy) techniques employed in the sessions focused on identifying and amplifying Xuan's existing strengths and resources. By exploring scenarios where he felt more positive and engaged, such as his interactions with friend B from another school, we highlighted moments where Xuan experienced genuine connection and support. This exploration was crucial in helping Xuan recognize that he already possessed the capability to form meaningful relationships, and that the feelings of loneliness and exclusion were not insurmountable barriers.\n\nAn essential turning point in the consultation was when Xuan began to envision a future where his desired changes had already taken place. The miracle question, a core technique in SFBT, encouraged Xuan to articulate his vision of a fulfilling social life and personal growth. His descriptions of engaging with teachers during breaks, participating in activities, and focusing on the supportive aspects of his friendships demonstrated his readiness to take proactive steps toward improvement. This exercise was instrumental in fostering a sense of agency and hope, reinforcing the belief that change was not only possible but already within his reach.\n\nThe therapeutic journey was not without its challenges. Navigating Xuan's entrenched beliefs about his inadequacy and sensitivity required a delicate balance of empathy and challenge. It was imperative to validate his feelings and experiences while gently guiding him toward alternative perspectives that encouraged resilience and self-acceptance. The counselor's role was to act as a mirror, reflecting back Xuan's strengths and potential while holding a safe space for him to explore and express his vulnerabilities.\n\nThroughout the entire process, it is more about relying on belief than on the supporting concepts. Ultimately, it achieved the effects of the first consultation; in addition to collecting information and tracing the origins, it also empowered Xuan, enabling him to leave with courage, strength, and his own methods to face the challenges he encountered. If the current predicament can be alleviated and resolved, it will give him greater courage, strength, and insight, enabling him to continue moving forward, creating a snowball effect, and ultimately achieving growth. Consequently, interpersonal issues and sensitivity will be alleviated or even resolved as his personality improves.\n\nReflecting on the sessions, I am reminded of the profound resilience inherent in the human spirit, particularly in young individuals like Xuan who are navigating the complexities of adolescence. The consultation process underscored the importance of creating a therapeutic environment where clients feel seen, heard, and validated. It reinforced the value of a strengths-based approach that empowers clients to harness their inherent capabilities and envision a future where they are active participants in their own growth and healing.\n\nThe journey with Xuan also highlighted the crucial role of patience and persistence in therapy. Change is often a gradual process, marked by small but significant shifts in perspective and behavior. As therapists, our task is to accompany clients on this journey, offering support, guidance, and a steadfast belief in their potential to overcome the challenges they face. The therapeutic relationship becomes a collaborative partnership, where both therapist and client work together to navigate the complexities of the human experience.\n\nIn conclusion, the experience with Xuan has been a testament to the transformative power of belief and the resilience of the human spirit. It has reinforced the importance of empathy, validation, and empowerment in the therapeutic process. As Xuan continues on his journey of self-discovery and growth, I am confident that he will draw upon the insights and strengths uncovered in our sessions to create a life that reflects his true potential and aspirations. This case has not only enriched my understanding as a clinician but has also deepened my appreciation for the intricate tapestry of human emotions and the profound capacity for healing and transformation.", "causes": "A close friend left school due to depression, which triggered deep-seated anxiety about friendship, marginalization and self-worth, superimposed on the influence of family environment, personal sensitivity and long-term growth experience.", "symptoms": "Low mood, lack of motivation, strong sense of loneliness, over-sensitivity to other people's words, difficulty in concentrating on studies, loss of hope for the future.", "treatment_process": "Using the SFBT technique, the counselor guided her to recognize her own strengths, reinterpreted her sensitivity as her strengths, and encouraged her to envision a positive future and put it into action through listening, clarification, and miracle questions.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Strong feelings of marginalization, high dependence on friendship, intertwined sense of self-worth and others' recognition, long-term loneliness and inner struggle.", "treatment_effect": "Improvement in emotional state, self-awareness, hope for the future, initial mastery of coping strategies, and good Treatment relationship."}

Reflecting on this scenario, it becomes clear that the challenges faced by Sun are not unique, but rather emblematic of broader societal trends. Adolescence is a period marked by significant psychological and emotional changes, and the clash between a parent's perception of their child and the child's self-concept is a recurring theme. \n\nTo delve deeper into the communication barriers between Sun and his son, we must first understand the psychological transformations that occur during adolescence. As children enter middle school, they begin to assert their independence and develop their own identities. This often leads to a tension between their desire for autonomy and their need for parental guidance. Sun's son, like many adolescents, is navigating the complex interplay between wanting to be treated as an adult while still relying on parental support. This developmental stage is characterized by a heightened sensitivity to perceived criticism and an intense need for validation.\n\nSun's experience highlights the critical importance of empathy and perspective-taking in fostering effective communication. Adolescents often feel misunderstood, and their reluctance to communicate can be a defense mechanism against perceived judgment or criticism. In the case of Sun's son, his behaviors—such as obsession with his phone and deteriorating grades—may be manifestations of an underlying struggle to cope with the pressures of adolescence. For parents, recognizing these behaviors as expressions of distress rather than defiance is crucial. This requires a shift in mindset from viewing these behaviors as problems to be fixed to understanding them as signals of deeper emotional needs.\n\nMoreover, the role of respect in parent-child interactions cannot be overstated. Adolescents crave respect and validation from their parents. They want to feel understood and valued, not belittled or dismissed. Sun's situation reveals the disconnect that can occur when parents fail to recognize their child's need for respect. The feeling of being \"looked down upon\" or \"contempt\" for parents, as mentioned in the case, is a profound barrier to communication. It is essential for parents to create an environment where their children feel respected and acknowledged. This involves active listening, genuine interest in their child's perspectives, and validation of their feelings and experiences.\n\nAnother critical aspect of enhancing parent-child communication is the manner in which parents express themselves. The tone of voice, choice of words, and overall demeanor play significant roles in how messages are received by adolescents. Sun's frustrations are mirrored in many parent-child dynamics where the authoritative tone can lead to resistance and withdrawal from the child. A kinder, more thoughtful approach can transform the communication dynamic. Parents should strive to express their concerns and guidance in ways that foster openness rather than defensiveness.\n\nThe notion of \"accomplishment\" and \"being admired\" touches on the intrinsic motivation of adolescents to achieve and be recognized. For Sun's son, like many adolescents, the sense of achievement and the need for admiration are powerful motivators. Parents can leverage this by highlighting their child's strengths and achievements, thereby boosting their confidence and willingness to engage in dialogue. Acknowledging accomplishments, no matter how small, can reinforce a child's self-worth and encourage them to open up.\n\nFurthermore, the concept of \"having a soulmate\" and the feeling of being respected underscores the importance of building a supportive relationship where the child feels understood. Sun's experience reflects the detrimental impact of parents emphasizing their own correctness, which can alienate the child. Instead, parents should focus on fostering a sense of mutual understanding. This involves empathy, the ability to see things from the child's perspective, and the creation of a safe space for the child to express themselves without fear of judgment.\n\nThe feeling of \"thoughtfulness\" and the sense of being cherished is another vital element in bridging the communication gap. Adolescents are highly sensitive to the way their parents communicate, and harsh words can have lasting negative effects. Sun's reflections bring to light the importance of parents speaking with kindness and patience. It is not only what is said but how it is said that matters. Parents must be mindful of their language and tone, ensuring that their communication is supportive rather than confrontational.\n\nFinally, Sun's case serves as a reminder of the reciprocal nature of communication barriers. They are not solely the result of the child's actions or attitudes but are equally influenced by the parent's approach. A truly loving and wise parent, as described in the reflection, embodies empathy, respect, and thoughtful communication. These qualities can transform the parent-child relationship and foster an environment conducive to open and honest dialogue.\n\nIn conclusion, the case of Sun and his son illustrates the multifaceted nature of communication barriers in parent-child relationships. It highlights the need for parents to adapt their approaches, cultivate empathy, and prioritize respect and understanding. By doing so, parents can navigate the challenges of adolescence more effectively and build stronger, more meaningful connections with their children.

In the case of Zhang, her anxiety was palpable during our initial meeting, as she expressed worry about her daughter's ability to review and perform well in exams. This scenario is not uncommon, as many parents find themselves overwhelmed by the pressure of their children's academic responsibilities. The key, however, is to understand that parental anxiety can often distort perception, leading to an overemphasis on negative aspects and an underappreciation of their child's strengths.\n\nThe metaphor of \"wearing colored glasses\" is apt in describing how anxiety can alter a parent's view of their child's capabilities and achievements. As anxiety levels rise, these glasses become tinted with darker shades of pessimism, leading parents to focus on potential problems rather than solutions. This perception can be self-reinforcing, as the more parents dwell on negatives, the more entrenched these views become, ultimately affecting their interactions with their children.\n\nClinically, it is vital to address this distorted perception by encouraging parents to adjust their mindset and focus on a balanced view of their child's progress. Cognitive-behavioral strategies can be effective in helping parents recognize and challenge negative thought patterns. By reframing their thoughts, parents can learn to appreciate their child's efforts and celebrate small victories, which can have a profound impact on reducing anxiety and improving family dynamics.\n\nAnother crucial aspect highlighted by the cases is the aggressive and harmful behavior that can arise from high anxiety levels. Mr. Ma's case illustrates how anxiety-driven actions can lead to significant harm, both emotionally and physically, to the child. The intense pressure to perform academically can drive parents to adopt extreme measures, such as constant monitoring and rigid control over their child's daily routine. These actions, though well-intentioned, can backfire, leading to deteriorating mental health and academic performance.\n\nIt is essential for parents to recognize that their behavior, driven by anxiety, can have unintended negative consequences. Helping parents understand the impact of their actions on their child's well-being is a critical component of therapeutic intervention. Encouraging open communication and fostering a supportive environment where children feel safe to express their feelings can mitigate the harmful effects of parental anxiety.\n\nFurthermore, the concept of \"doing things absurdly and being counterproductive\" highlights the irrational decisions parents may make under the influence of anxiety. In Mr. Li's case, his decision to purchase a smartphone and online courses for his child, contrary to school policy, was based on an assumption rooted in anxiety rather than rational thought. Such decisions often lead to negative outcomes, reinforcing the cycle of anxiety and poor academic performance.\n\nTo address these challenges, it is crucial to guide parents toward more constructive approaches. Emphasizing the importance of collaboration with educators and reliance on professional guidance can help parents make informed decisions that support their child's learning journey. Encouraging parents to trust in the educational system and the expertise of teachers can alleviate the pressure they place on themselves and their children.\n\nIn summary, the reflection on these cases reveals the multifaceted nature of parental anxiety and its far-reaching impact on children. The experience has reinforced the importance of emotional regulation, open communication, and a balanced perspective in fostering healthy family relationships. By adopting these principles, parents can become effective role models, teaching their children valuable lessons in resilience and emotional intelligence. As clinicians, our role is to provide the tools and support necessary for parents to navigate these challenges, ultimately creating a nurturing environment where children can thrive.", "causes": "Parental anxiety triggered by excessive worry about the child's schooling.", "symptoms": "Parents' cognitive distortion, inappropriate words and behaviors.", "treatment_process": "Using metacognitive intervention techniques, intervene by adjusting cognition, regulating emotions, changing methods, emphasizing leading by example and other strategies.", "characteristics_of_illness": "Parental anxiety is inversely proportional to the child's performance, and may be chronic when there is no objective cause, and the anxiety is temporarily relieved with the end of the test.

The counseling primarily utilized Ellis's Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy and positive self-suggestion techniques to help the client understand, accept, and adapt to collective living, rebuild confidence, restore a positive lifestyle, improve cognition, and eliminate negative emotional experiences. Follow-up evaluations indicated significant counseling effects.\n\n1. General Information\n1. General Situation\nLi Ping (pseudonym), female, 19 years old, majoring in Preventive Medicine, is a freshman from a county town. Both of her parents are leaders in their workplace, and the family is well-off. Detailed inquiries revealed that neither parent has personality disorders or other neurotic disorders, and there is no history of mental illness in three generations of both sides of the family.\n\n2. Personal Growth History\nAs an only child, she was born at full term through a natural delivery, with a healthy mother who did not take any special medications during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding. She began menstruating at 13, with a stable cycle, and has been healthy since childhood, never suffering from major illnesses. Her academic performance has always been excellent, and she has been learning piano since childhood, being multi-talented and well-liked by classmates and teachers. Before university, she had no experience with collective living, and her parents had high expectations of her, handling everything except her studies and piano practice, resulting in her poor personal management skills and difficulties in communication.\n\n3. Mental State\nShe is well-dressed and age-appropriate, but often keeps her head down while talking, occasionally looking up with hesitant eye contact and a quivering voice. She actively discusses her discomfort at a fast pace, possesses complete self-awareness, and expresses an urgent desire for treatment.\n\n4. Physical State\nShe has been healthy since childhood, never having serious illnesses. However, she has developed emotional issues such as tension and anxiety due to adapting to a new environment, occasionally experiencing chest tightness, palpitations, and difficulty sleeping.\n\n5. Social Function\nHer social functioning has not been impaired; she is able to study and live normally without signs of avoidance or generalization.\n\n6. Psychological Assessment Results\nThe chosen assessment scales were SCL-90, SDS, and SAS. The results showed somatization at 1.5, obsessive-compulsive symptoms at 1.7, interpersonal sensitivity at 2.5, depression at 2.8, anxiety at 3.6, hostility at 1.4, phobia at 1.0, paranoia at 1.9, psychoticism at 1.6, and other at 1.8, with a total score of 181.4 and 45 positive items. The SDS score was 45 (standard score 56, exceeding the Chinese norm cutoff of 53), indicating mild depression. The SAS score was 52 (standard score 65, exceeding the Chinese norm cutoff of 50), indicating moderate anxiety.\n\n2. Main Complaints and Personal Statements\n1. Main Complaint\nAfter more than two months in university, she often feels confused and lost, unsure of what to do in college, unable to find direction in life, and frequently has small conflicts with her roommates. She has become silent in the dorm, feeling like an ignorant child, inferior to others, unlikable, lonely, and suffering. Due to her recent low mood, depressive feelings, and emotional fluctuations, she sought help in the counseling room.\n\n2. Personal Statement\nNearly two months into the semester, she still feels various forms of discomfort. In Fuzhou, the city often evokes a sense of isolation, and her roommates are annoying, chatting late into the night with the lights on, severely disrupting her sleep and biological clock. University life is entirely different from her expectations; she feels lost and unmotivated, unsure of what to read or its usefulness. She suddenly questions the purpose of attending university when she was once an outstanding student in high school. She expected university to be a time for self-development and showcasing her abilities, but since starting, she feels she is no longer exceptional, struggling academically, especially in biochemistry, no longer holding leadership positions, and having unpleasant interactions with classmates. Her emotions fluctuate and are unstable. She feels the burden of relying on herself for many things while studying away from home, worries about not completing her studies smoothly, and sometimes feels inferior, leading to many psychological conflicts and confusions. September was supposed to be a time for setting sail, but she feels like a stranded ship during this season.\n\n3. Counselor Observations and Feedback from Others\nThe client exhibits low mood, crying when discussing the loneliness and helplessness of studying away from home. Her awareness is intact, her expression is coherent, and she seeks help without avoidance or withdrawal behaviors. Feedback from her roommates indicates that she often does not engage with classmates, is sensitive, occasionally argues with her roommates, tends to sulk, and sometimes lies in bed staring blankly, not wanting to talk. She is kind and willing to help others and plays the piano well but does not like to showcase her talents and remains quiet.\n\n4. Assessment and Diagnosis\n1. Diagnosis Results\nBased on the client's statements, observations, and investigations, the primary issues identified are low mood, tension, anxiety, inferiority, and maladjustment. According to clinical observations and psychological test results, she is diagnosed with general psychological issues related to maladjustment to university life.\n\n2. Diagnostic Basis\n(1) Based on the \"three principles of judging illness versus non-illness,\" the client exhibits coordinated awareness, stable personality, complete self-awareness, proactive help-seeking behavior, and lacks chaotic logical thinking, perceptual abnormalities, and symptoms such as hallucinations or delusions, thus excluding mental illness.\n(2) According to symptomatic standards, the client demonstrates symptoms of anxiety and depression, with moderate intensity limited to interactions with classmates and daily life, without affecting logical thinking, and without avoidance or generalization, thus no severe impact on social functioning. The duration is just over one month. Based on exclusion standards, the client's psychological issues are not severe and have a short duration, thus excluding severe psychological problems and neurotic disorders.\n(3) Based on collected clinical data, the client has normal intelligence, an introverted personality, unstable emotions, and tends to be anxious, overall indicating poor mental state. The psychological and behavioral abnormalities exhibited by the client fall within the category of general psychological issues.\n\n3. Differential Diagnosis\n(1) Differentiating from mental illness: Based on the three principles, mental illness is characterized by a lack of coordination between awareness and intent, lack of self-awareness, and a tendency to not seek help, often manifesting hallucinations, delusions, disorganized logical thinking, and abnormal behavior. The client, however, demonstrates coordinated awareness, self-awareness, and seeks help without hallucinations or delusions.\n(2) Differentiating from neurosis: While the client exhibits symptoms of depression, anxiety, and sensitivity, the duration is short, the content is not generalized, and there is no severe impact on social functioning or logical thinking. The psychological conflicts are significantly realistic, differing from the distortions typical of neurotic conflicts, thus excluding neurosis.\n(3) Differentiating from severe psychological problems: Severe psychological problems exhibit strong reaction intensity, generalized responses, severe impacts on social functioning, and a duration exceeding two months. The client's psychological issues are not severe, have not significantly impacted social functioning, and have a short duration, thus excluding severe psychological problems.\n(4) Differentiating from depression: The client exhibits significant depressive emotions, low mood, loneliness, and sensitivity, but these arise from internal conflicts and are not severe, with no suicidal tendencies or low self-evaluation, and have not severely impacted social functioning or logical thinking, thus excluding depression.\n\n5. Establishing Counseling Goals\nBased on the assessment and diagnosis, the following counseling goals were established in consultation with the client: \nSpecific and Short-term Goals: The client's main issue is maladaptation to the new learning environment, with the primary factor affecting her psychological state being environmental adaptation and building good interpersonal relationships. Therefore, the counseling goals are (1) to establish good interpersonal relationships and form a strong social support system; (2) to accept reality, work on improving her mood, learn relaxation techniques, reduce stress, and alleviate tension and anxiety.\nUltimate and Long-term Goals: To enhance the client's personality, form a correct self-concept, improve her ability to effectively handle various life setbacks, enhance her confidence and social adaptability, promote her mental health and development, and achieve personality perfection.\n\n6.

Counseling Time and Fees\nCounseling frequency: once a week, 40 minutes per session. \nCounseling fee: 40 yuan per session. \nPsychological test fees: SCL-90: 100 yuan, SAS: 20 yuan, SDS: 20 yuan.\n\n7. Counseling Process\nThe counseling process consists of three phases: the psychological assessment and diagnosis phase, the counseling phase, and the consolidation and conclusion phase.\n1. Psychological Assessment and Diagnosis Phase\nThe first counseling session aimed to gather information, establish a counseling relationship, conduct psychological diagnosis, and determine counseling goals. Methods: discussions and assessments. The primary approach used the client-centered therapy concept, focusing on building a trusting relationship. The counselor patiently listened to the client's grievances, understood her growth process and basic situation, allowed her to express her repressed emotions, and offered empathy and sympathy, assuring her that this was a common psychological issue that could improve with active cooperation. The counselor also assisted her in completing psychological assessments.\n\n2. Counseling Phase\n(1) Problem Analysis\nThe purpose of the second counseling session was to deepen the counseling relationship and improve her maladaptive cognitive patterns. Method: Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy. The client reflected on her situation since enrollment: due to her excellent background, she had developed a sense of superiority, always believing she was better than others. However, her classmates in university were very capable, leading to feelings of inadequacy. She recognized the need for an adjustment process to a new environment and realized that she was too impatient and had set her standards too high. She often felt lonely yet was reluctant to reach out to others, hoping others would initiate contact. At home, her family had always pampered her, and any mistakes were met with understanding. Now, her roommates often pointed out her shortcomings, making remarks like, \"Children from wealthy families are different,\" which made her feel disrespected and unlikable. She found it hard to sleep at night, often replaying the day's events in her mind, leading to tears and a longing for the warmth of home. In addressing this situation, the counselor applied Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (ABC theory), helping the client realize that her maladjustment (A) led to feelings of depression, anxiety, and sleep difficulties (C) rooted in her self-denying attitude and perfectionist tendencies (B). The counselor assisted her in identifying and abandoning her irrational beliefs, learning to replace them with rational ones. The counselor also introduced the \"golden rule\": treat others as you wish to be treated, helping her find ways to improve her interpersonal relationships. Through analysis, the client gained insight into her psychological issues, recognizing that her anxiety and low mood primarily stemmed from some of her irrational beliefs, and that her current situation was not as dire as she had imagined. At the end of the session, the counselor assigned homework: (1) Write a Rational Self-Analysis (RSA report) listing A (event), C (emotion), B (belief), D (disputation of irrational beliefs), E (new beliefs), detailing some of her irrational beliefs in learning and life and attempting to replace them with rational beliefs. (2) Identify ten personal strengths, write them down, and read them aloud five times a day.\n\n(2) Implementation of Treatment\nThe purpose of the third counseling session was to break the tendency for perfectionism, establish positive cognition, and rebuild confidence. Methods: discussions, positive self-suggestion, and Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy. (1) Feedback on counseling homework: The client expressed difficulty in identifying her ten strengths, some of which she learned from her roommates. Reading them aloud five times made her feel good, realizing, \"I have so many valuable qualities.\" She acknowledged that she had underestimated herself and recognized her potential for growth with appropriate adjustments. (2) Cognitive Reconstruction: Through the RSA report, the counselor guided the client to recognize the following analysis: having been pampered since childhood, she had never disappointed her parents or teachers, making excellence a habit, and wherever she went, she aimed to be the best! Previously, she was in a strong position in her learning environment, the center of attention, whereas in university, she finds herself in a weaker position, having to manage everything independently away from home, creating a significant psychological gap. The intense conflict between her strong self-esteem and feelings of inferiority led to emotional fluctuations and psychological imbalances. To resolve this psychological conflict and adjust her imbalanced mindset, she should start by reevaluating her new learning environment, correctly understanding herself, and adjusting her psychological expectations. The counselor helped her understand the characteristics of university learning, recognize her learning abilities, analyze her strengths and weaknesses, and advised her to leverage her strengths. \"You are already doing great now; having passed level ten in piano, you might be the only one in the whole school.\" The counselor encouraged her to stop demanding to be better than others, emphasizing that it's impossible for anyone to excel in all aspects. She should confront reality instead of avoiding it, embracing life to win the applause of her classmates. (3) Homework: Continue to read her strengths aloud and actively engage in rational self-analysis.\n\nThe fourth counseling session aimed to consolidate the results of cognitive reconstruction. Methods: discussions, positive self-suggestion, and Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy. (1) Feedback on counseling homework: The client gradually adapted to her environment, overcoming her depressive mood, accepting reality, embracing herself, and building confidence. (2) Further positive self-suggestion. (3) Consolidation of cognitive reconstruction: The counselor guided her to correctly recognize her self-worth and adjust her former sense of superiority, objectively analyze herself, set new goals that match her abilities, and redefine her role to adapt to the new environment. Addressing her interpersonal relationship confusion, the counselor suggested she learn to empathize with classmates and apply the \"golden rule\" to foster friendship through collaboration; participate more in campus cultural and social activities to break out of her isolated bubble and experience the warmth of a larger community. Regarding her competitive mindset of wanting to be first in everything, the counselor helped her realize that such an attitude would lead to dissatisfaction with the current situation, creating psychological imbalances, and if her expectations are too high, it could cause repeated failures affecting her confidence. The counselor encouraged her to debate her irrational beliefs and replace them with rational ones. To address her symptoms of chest tightness, palpitations, and difficulty sleeping, the counselor helped her understand these were primarily due to excessive mental pressure. She should view new problems rationally, relieve mental stress, and practice self-relaxation techniques to gradually alleviate or eliminate these symptoms.\n\n3. Consolidation and Conclusion Phase\nThe fifth counseling session aimed to consolidate counseling outcomes, summarize previous sessions, and conclude the counseling. Methods: discussions and assessments. (1) Feedback on counseling homework: The client gradually recognized the authenticity and reality of life, accepted her current living conditions, improved her self-awareness and acceptance abilities, and showed significant improvement in her emotional state. (2) The counselor pointed out directions for continued effort. (3) Conducted SCL-90, SDS, and SAS assessments, comparing them with pre-counseling results. A brief summary of previous sessions was made, inviting the client to share her experiences and feelings and summarizing her growth throughout the counseling process.\n\n8. Evaluation of Counseling Effectiveness\nClient self-assessment: The client indicated she has felt much better recently, her communication with roommates has improved, and they all went out together to hike Gushan and explore fun places in Fuzhou. She has developed a stronger interest in learning and improved her study efficiency. Under her roommates' guidance, her ability to manage daily life has increased, learning to fold triangular quilts and tie scarves, among other skills. Counselor assessment: Through follow-up and tracking, it was found that the counseling had largely achieved its intended goals: changing some of the client’s irrational beliefs and redefining her learning and life objectives. The client’s emotional state has significantly improved, her interpersonal relationships are healthy, and her positive mindset has increased, enabling her to fully engage in normal study, life, and social interactions. Therefore, it is concluded that the client has overcome the psychological issues that troubled her. \n\nPsychological test results: SCL-90: somatization 1.9, obsessive-compulsive symptoms 1.6, interpersonal sensitivity 1.7, depression 1.7, anxiety 1.9, hostility 1.4, phobia 1.9, paranoia 1.0, psychoticism 1.6, other 1.6; total score 149; 36 positive items, with all factor scores within the normal range. SAS: raw score 40, standard score 50, indicating no anxiety. SDS: raw score 36, standard score 45, indicating no depression.\n\nNotes:\n1.

They are welcomed by a new environment, new school, new teachers, new classmates, and new courses. In the face of all this, freshmen will experience a psychological adjustment period, lasting approximately 3 months to 1 year, with a few requiring even longer. During this time, freshmen may experience some psychological confusion to varying degrees. Although university students have left the group of children, psychological maturity does not equate to social maturity; they are still unable to fully fulfill adult responsibilities and obligations, often being excluded from adult circles. Typical psychological manifestations include inner conflict, uncertainty about their aspirations, and a tendency to adopt extreme positions.\n\nReflecting on this particular case of Li Ping, a freshman experiencing significant psychological adjustment issues, we gain a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between personal history, environmental changes, and the inherent challenges of transitioning to university life. Li Ping’s journey underscores the nuanced challenges that many students face during this pivotal time.\n\nLi Ping, hailing from a well-off family and having excelled academically throughout her school life, found herself grappling with feelings of inadequacy and confusion upon entering university. Her situation is emblematic of the struggles that arise when a student's previous experiences and expectations collide with the new reality of university life. The transition from being a high-achieving student in a familiar environment to becoming one among many talented peers in a competitive academic setting can create a profound identity crisis. This shift can trigger feelings of inferiority, loss of direction, and emotional distress, as witnessed in Li Ping's case.\n\nIn examining Li Ping’s personal history, it becomes evident that her upbringing played a crucial role in shaping her current psychological state. As an only child, she was accustomed to a high level of parental involvement and support, which, while nurturing her academic and artistic talents, may have inadvertently limited her development of personal management skills and resilience. Her parents’ high expectations and protective nature meant that Li Ping was rarely exposed to situations where she had to navigate challenges independently. This lack of experience in self-management and problem-solving became starkly apparent when she was faced with the demands of university life, where she had to juggle academic responsibilities, social interactions, and personal care without the immediate support system she was used to.\n\nLi Ping’s initial response to her new environment was characterized by withdrawal and self-doubt, as she struggled to reconcile her self-image with her perceived shortcomings in this new context. Her experiences with her roommates further exacerbated her feelings of isolation and inadequacy. The late-night activities and differing lifestyles in the dormitory setting disrupted her routine and sleep, contributing to her emotional volatility and sense of being out of control. These interactions also highlighted her sensitivity to criticism and her difficulty in asserting her needs, both of which are common issues for individuals who have not had ample opportunities to develop robust interpersonal skills.\n\nA critical aspect of Li Ping’s counseling was the application of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) and positive self-suggestion techniques. These methods were instrumental in helping her identify and challenge the irrational beliefs that were fueling her anxiety and depressive symptoms. Through the counseling process, Li Ping learned to recognize the perfectionist tendencies and self-critical thoughts that were contributing to her distress. The structured approach of REBT allowed her to dissect her emotional responses and understand the underlying beliefs that were driving them. For instance, her belief that she must always excel and be the best in every situation was identified as an unrealistic and self-defeating expectation, which was creating undue pressure and dissatisfaction.\n\nThe introduction of positive self-suggestion techniques further supported Li Ping’s cognitive restructuring. By encouraging her to focus on her strengths and achievements, she began to rebuild her self-esteem and develop a more balanced view of her capabilities. This shift in perspective was crucial in helping her move away from a deficit-focused mindset towards one that acknowledged her potential and accomplishments. The process of identifying personal strengths and reciting them regularly served as a powerful tool in countering the negative self-talk that had become habitual for Li Ping.\n\nAs the counseling progressed, Li Ping demonstrated significant growth in her ability to adapt to her new environment. She became more proactive in seeking social connections and participating in campus activities, which helped to alleviate her feelings of loneliness and build a supportive network of peers. Her improved self-awareness and confidence were reflected in her interactions with her roommates, where she began to assert her needs more effectively and engage in cooperative activities. This shift not only enhanced her interpersonal relationships but also contributed to a more harmonious living situation, reducing the stressors that were impacting her emotional well-being.\n\nThe case of Li Ping highlights the importance of addressing both cognitive and behavioral aspects in the treatment of psychological adjustment issues. By combining REBT with positive self-suggestion, the counseling process facilitated a holistic transformation in Li Ping’s approach to challenges and her perception of herself. The emphasis on developing a realistic self-concept and nurturing self-compassion was pivotal in fostering her resilience and adaptability.\n\nFurthermore, this case underscores the broader implications of psychological adjustment for university students. The transition to university represents a significant developmental milestone, marked by increased independence and the need to navigate complex social and academic environments. For many students, this period is characterized by a reevaluation of personal identity and goals, as they reconcile their past achievements and future aspirations with the demands of their new environment. The psychological adjustment period can thus be seen as a critical phase in which students develop the skills and coping mechanisms necessary for successful adulthood.\n\nIn reflecting on the outcomes of the counseling process, it is evident that Li Ping’s journey is a testament to the transformative power of targeted psychological interventions. The counseling not only addressed her immediate psychological distress but also equipped her with the tools to manage future challenges. Her improved emotional regulation, enhanced self-awareness, and strengthened interpersonal skills are likely to serve her well beyond her university years, contributing to her overall personal growth and development.\n\nAs clinicians, this case reinforces the importance of adopting a comprehensive approach to counseling, one that considers the individual’s personal history, current challenges, and future aspirations. By integrating cognitive-behavioral techniques with personalized strategies for self-improvement, we can support our clients in achieving meaningful and lasting change. Additionally, this case serves as a reminder of the value of fostering an empathetic and supportive therapeutic relationship, which can provide the foundation for effective intervention and personal growth.\n\nIn conclusion, Li Ping’s experience offers valuable insights into the psychological challenges faced by university freshmen and the effective strategies that can be employed to support their adjustment. Her journey from confusion and self-doubt to confidence and self-assurance illustrates the potential for personal transformation through targeted psychological support. As we continue to work with students navigating the transition to university life, we can draw on these insights to enhance our practice and better meet the needs of this unique population.", "causes": "Family spoiling, environmental changes, perfectionist tendency.", "symptoms": "low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, social withdrawal, mood swings, loneliness, sleep difficulties.", "treatment_process": "Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy (REBT) and positive self-suggestion were used to gradually improve cognition and behavior in three stages.", "characteristics_of_illness": "maladaptation, depressed mood, anxiety, low self-esteem, etc., poor psychological state.", "treatment_effect": "After five counseling sessions, the symptoms improved significantly, the psychological test returned to normal, and the adaptive ability was enhanced."}

In the end, the husband helplessly agreed to give his wife their two apartments, two cars, hundreds of thousands in savings, and custody of the children. Seeing the husband's desperate pleas and the wife's silent tears, I felt that this couple had a story to tell, so I invited them into the marriage and family counseling room.", "It turns out that the husband had an affair while drunk half a month ago, which was discovered by his wife. In fact, there are deep feelings between the couple and for their home, but they often feel pain and repression while being together. In the counseling room, this couple shared their unforgettable and moving love story. The woman, who calls herself \"Peacock Girl,\" Xiaoqian, was born into a relatively wealthy family in the city and was considered the apple of her family's eye. However, due to her parents being busy with business when they were young, they rarely took care of her in daily life. Growing up with her grandparents, Xiaoqian developed an independent, strong-willed, and capable personality, somewhat like a \"tomboy.\" At the age of 24, she met Wang Xin, a \"Phoenix Man\" from her father's company. Wang Xin, a university graduate, was smart, diligent, eager to learn, and well-mannered, and he was also quite good-looking. However, he came from a rural family in Henan, where the local economic conditions were poor. Wang Xin was the first university student to come out of his village. For some reason, Xiaoqian felt a special affection for this honest young man and inexplicably wanted to be with him, often helping his family financially under various pretenses. As time went on, their feelings deepened, and they agreed to be lifelong partners. When Xiaoqian's parents learned that their daughter was in love with a rural boy from a poor family, they strongly opposed the marriage, claiming that if Xiaoqian married Wang Xin, they would sever ties with her and that she shouldn't expect a penny as a bride price. Xiaoqian, who had a strong personality, felt even more rebellious when her parents were so unreasonable, believing they were snobbish and favored the wealthy. She was determined to marry Wang Xin and help his family live a better life to show her \"snobbish\" parents. Thus, Xiaoqian took no bride price from Wang Xin, and the two rented a room in the city and moved in together. Xiaoqian was capable and had a good business sense, and after years of experience in her father's company, she knew a thing or two about business. Wang Xin was hard-working and honest, and the couple worked very well together, quickly starting their own company, which prospered. Two years later, their clever son was born, bringing even more joy to their thriving little family! Eighteen years passed in a flash, and now, in middle age, the couple, Wang Xin and Xiaoqian, had become successful entrepreneurs with a bit of fame in their local area. Their 18-year-old son was also doing well, having been admitted to a prestigious university in the country with excellent grades this year. Wang Xin's parents were particularly satisfied with their good life today, boasting to everyone that their son had married a good wife, and that without this good wife, the family wouldn’t have their current happiness, which even made relatives and friends envious of them. However, in recent years, the more his parents praised his wife and the more relatives and friends envied them, the more uncomfortable Wang Xin felt inside.", "Calculating with his fingers, Wang Xin realized that he and his wife had been married for almost 20 years. His wife's overbearing and domineering personality had not diminished in the slightest; instead, it had intensified with the onset of menopause. Although his wife still maintained a semblance of decorum in front of others, as soon as they returned home, she became the \"empress dowager,\" bossing him around all day. She made all the decisions, and if Wang Xin expressed any dissatisfaction, she would often resort to insults or even physical blows. Sometimes, their son would catch these scenes, and Wang Xin felt utterly humiliated, wishing he could just disappear into a crack in the ground. However, Wang Xin always felt guilty towards his wife and never dared to argue or reason with her; even when she slapped him, he would endure it without retaliating. This life of enduring humiliation made Wang Xin feel especially oppressed and inferior, leading him to withdraw from friends and feel like he was lesser than others. In recent years, his personality had become increasingly reclusive, and he would often lose his temper for no apparent reason. Moreover, their sexual relationship had deteriorated, with his wife constantly accusing him of being weak and not manly enough. Sometimes, even halfway through their intimate moments, she would angrily push him aside and insult him. Now, Wang Xin felt increasingly passive in their sexual life and was increasingly afraid of being intimate with his wife, which in turn led her to become suspicious of him, checking his phone constantly. Whenever he went out for a meal with business clients, he would receive several probing calls from her. At times, she would start yelling at him, which was incredibly embarrassing for him. He often made excuses to answer her calls in secluded places, but his hesitance only fueled her suspicions, leading to more frequent arguments between them. Now, just the thought of going home made him feel uncomfortable; he really didn't want to go back and kept finding various excuses to dodge his wife, which only aroused her suspicions further.", "One night not long ago, he went to a bar to pass the time after getting drunk. He accidentally vomited all over the place, and the waitress not only hurriedly helped to clean up but also carefully wiped and washed him, taking care of him in every possible way. It was the first time Wang Xin experienced the feeling of being cared for and treated tenderly by the opposite sex, awakening a unique sense of possessiveness and confidence in him as a man. Later, he had a sexual encounter with the waitress.", "Although he experienced the dignity of being a man for the first time in his sexual life with the young lady, he subsequently fell into deep guilt and self-blame towards his wife and took the initiative to confess his mistakes to her. Upon hearing this, his wife erupted in anger and completely broke down. In recent years, her husband had become increasingly bold in talking back to her and losing his temper, which she could somewhat accept, but she never expected her usually honest and upright husband would dare to challenge her psychological bottom line in this way, something she could not tolerate. This was the reason she insisted on divorcing him. The wife said, \"I know my personality is too strong, and it's hard for most men to accept it. That’s why I chose Wang Xin, who is honest and doesn't come from a wealthy family, as my lifelong partner, believing that such a man would provide me with a sense of security after marriage and wouldn’t dare to challenge my authority at home.\" After that incident, she completely broke down, and in her pain, she kept questioning herself about where she went wrong and why her husband would punish her in such a way. She recalled a saying her mother once told her: \"Don’t be too self-righteous; a clay figure has its limits, and even a rat will bite when it’s cornered!\" Perhaps she had been too excessive over the years, making all the decisions herself without giving her husband any rights or democracy, leaving him unable to find his self-respect as a man at home. Yet she had also lived in oppression, hardship, and exhaustion during these years. To help her husband succeed, she not only meticulously assisted him in his career but also never allowed him to be distracted at home. This excessive toil had drained her, causing her to enter menopause too early and suffer from chronic diseases like chronic nephritis and cystitis. Meanwhile, her husband was still in his prime and thriving in his career. In recent years, his temper had grown larger, and his opinions more assertive, which made her feel increasingly insecure and less confident, especially after their only son went to college this year. She often felt a void in her life and her suspicion towards her husband intensified; whenever he went to work, her heart would always feel \"tied up.\" I asked her, if we were to analyze the relationships among your family members using a role-playing metaphor, what would the dynamics be among the three of you? The wife wiped away her tears of grievance and finally looked up at me to speak: \"Teacher, I know what you want to ask. In fact, I have long been aware of the issues in our marriage and have read many books about family and marriage. Over these years of marriage, I have felt like a mother living with two 'sons'; my husband always seems like a child who hasn’t grown up, needing me to worry about everything. I’m tired and feeling wronged, and I want to lean on a broad shoulder, act a little spoiled, and be a little woman, but I can't. I know this is due to my personality. There’s a problem with our family role-playing; we have only a mother and sons, but no husband and wife, which feels abnormal to me. I particularly envy those families where the husband and wife support each other, thinking they are truly happy.\" Seeing the wife actively acknowledging her problems and mistakes, her husband, who had been stooping with a face full of grievance, gradually straightened his back, and his expression became much more relaxed. \"Teacher, what should we, as a couple, do to play our rightful roles in our family life and return to a normal marital life?\"", "Seeing that the couple has a clearer understanding of their issues and both have the desire and motivation to change, I have a greater confidence in helping them improve their marital relationship. Psychological counseling is a process, and particularly in marriage and family therapy, it cannot be completed in a short period of time. Therefore, we have jointly developed a family therapy plan. Our counseling plan includes: Step one, using three to five counseling sessions to explore how their respective family of origin has influenced their personalities; Step two, examining how the misaligned roles they adopted after marriage have gradually become entrenched; Step three, understanding the impact of their misaligned role-playing patterns on the future of their family, and even on their son and his future marriage and family. Our counseling goal is to interrupt the intergenerational transmission of misaligned role-playing patterns within the family, thereby changing the interpersonal relationship patterns of the entire family and altering the fate of the whole family."], "experience_and_reflection": "The ancient Chinese philosophical classic, the \"I Ching,\" tells us that the movement of yin and yang is the fundamental law governing all things. The balance of yin and yang is the essence of life's vitality, and marriage must also adhere to this natural law. A balanced relationship between husband and wife (yin and yang) leads to a happy, harmonious, and vibrant marriage, while an imbalanced relationship can result in conflict, discord, and even the dissolution of the marital family. Over the years, I have combined this yin-yang balance theory with structural family therapy, achieving relatively good counseling results. Structural family therapy is one of the four major therapeutic models in family therapy, focusing on the structure of the family, including organization, relationships, roles, and the execution of power. It employs a variety of specific methods to correct structural issues within the family and promote the improvement of family functioning. For example, in this article, the role-playing between Xiao Qian and Wang Xin is inappropriate, even reversed, so my therapeutic focus is on correcting the role-playing.\n\nReflecting on the case of Wang Xin and Xiao Qian, I am reminded of how deeply entrenched cultural narratives can shape personal identities and relational dynamics. The couple's dynamic, characterized by Xiao Qian's dominant presence and Wang Xin's submissive demeanor, exemplifies a modern iteration of the age-old yin-yang imbalance. Xiao Qian, the \"Peacock Girl,\" embodies a yin that has assumed a yang-like force, while Wang Xin, the \"Phoenix Man,\" has allowed his yang to be overshadowed, adopting a more yin-like receptivity. This inversion is not merely a personal issue but a systemic one, reflecting broader societal shifts where traditional roles are increasingly questioned yet remain deeply influential.\n\nIn considering their backgrounds, it becomes evident how family of origin experiences have profoundly impacted their present roles. Xiao Qian's upbringing in a relatively wealthy but emotionally distant family has instilled in her a sense of self-reliance and control. Her strong personality, akin to a \"tomboy,\" likely developed as a defense mechanism against the emotional neglect she experienced. Her narrative is one of rebellion against perceived parental snobbery, a rebellion that found expression in her marriage to Wang Xin. Her need to assert control within the marriage can be seen as an extension of this rebellion—a way to maintain the independence and strength she cultivated in her youth.\n\nWang Xin, on the other hand, emerged from a rural background where academic achievement was his ticket to a better life. As the first university student from his village, he bore the weight of his family's hopes, which may have contributed to his low self-esteem and passive behavior. His marriage to Xiao Qian, a woman of means and determination, likely reinforced his feelings of inadequacy, leading him to adopt a more submissive role to maintain harmony and avoid conflict. His affair, then, can be interpreted as a misguided attempt to reclaim some sense of masculinity and autonomy that he felt was denied in his marriage.\n\nThe couple's issues are not merely interpersonal but also intergenerational. Xiao Qian's dominant role mirrors the dynamics she likely observed in her family of origin, while Wang Xin's passivity may reflect the traditional expectations of men from his cultural background, where they are expected to be the providers without necessarily asserting emotional dominance. This interplay of roles has significant implications for their son, who has grown up witnessing a marriage where power is imbalanced and communication fraught. The risk here is the perpetuation of these dysfunctional patterns into the next generation, potentially affecting his future relationships.\n\nIn our counseling sessions, the challenge has been to help both Xiao Qian and Wang Xin re-negotiate their roles within the marriage, striving for a more balanced dynamic where both parties feel valued and respected. Structural family therapy offers tools to facilitate this re-negotiation by focusing on altering the family's organizational patterns. The first step has been to explore how their respective family of origin experiences have influenced their personalities and relational expectations. This exploration helps to surface underlying assumptions and fears that drive their behavior, paving the way for meaningful change.\n\nThe next step involves examining the entrenched roles they adopted after marriage. Xiao Qian's role as the decision-maker and Wang Xin's role as the compliant partner have become deeply ingrained, yet both express a desire for a more egalitarian partnership. This desire is a hopeful sign, indicating that both are open to change. By unpacking these roles, we aim to help them understand how their current dynamic has evolved and how it impacts their emotional connection and family functioning.\n\nUnderstanding the impact of their misaligned role-playing patterns on their family's future is crucial. Their son, who has witnessed these dynamics, may internalize similar patterns unless the cycle is interrupted. Our goal is to alter these patterns, not only for Xiao Qian and Wang Xin's benefit but also to prevent the intergenerational transmission of dysfunctional relational dynamics. By doing so, we aim to foster healthier relationships within the family and set a positive example for their son as he navigates his own relationships.\n\nThis case has reinforced my belief in the importance of integrating cultural understanding with therapeutic interventions. The cultural narratives that shape our clients' identities and relationships must be acknowledged and addressed within therapy. For Wang Xin and Xiao Qian, their cultural backgrounds provide a rich context for understanding their roles and behaviors. As a therapist, it is my responsibility to honor these narratives while guiding them toward a healthier, more balanced dynamic.\n\nMoreover, this case highlights the resilience of the human spirit and the capacity for change. Despite years of entrenched patterns, both Xiao Qian and Wang Xin demonstrate a willingness to engage in the therapeutic process and strive for a better relationship. Their journey is a testament to the power of therapy to facilitate growth and healing, even in the most challenging circumstances.\n\nIn conclusion, the case of Wang Xin and Xiao Qian illustrates the complexity of marital relationships and the myriad factors that contribute to imbalance and discord. Through structural family therapy and an understanding of yin-yang dynamics, we can help couples like them navigate their challenges and work toward a more harmonious and fulfilling partnership. This process requires patience, empathy, and a deep understanding of the cultural and personal narratives that shape their lives. As therapists, we have the privilege of accompanying our clients on this journey, offering support and guidance as they strive to create a more balanced and vibrant future together.", "causes": "Family of origin", "symptoms": "Repressed and painful relationship between husband and wife, and sexual disharmony.", "treatment_process": "First explore the influence of the family of origin on their personality, then dissect the solidified roles after marriage, and finally understand the impact of these patterns on the future of the family and make plans for change accordingly.", "characteristics_of_illness": "There was an imbalance of yin and yang in the marriage, showing a misaligned pattern of Xiaoqian's dominance and Wang Xin's submissiveness, which was continuously reinforced in the family life, affecting the couple's relationship and the family atmosphere.", "treatment_effect": "The couple has a clear understanding of the problem and a willingness to change, and the treatment provides them with direction and confidence to improve their marital relationship, which is expected to interrupt the intergenerational transmission of the undesirable family pattern and improve the interpersonal relationship of the family."}
