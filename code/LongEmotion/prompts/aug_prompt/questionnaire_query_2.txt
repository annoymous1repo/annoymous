Step back and reflect cognitively on what happened.
How did you make sense of the situation? Did you see it as a threat, opportunity, or neutral event? Why?
What thoughts or beliefs colored your interpretation? (Consider cognitive biases, past similar situations, or underlying fears.)
Did your thinking amplify or calm down the original emotions? How?
