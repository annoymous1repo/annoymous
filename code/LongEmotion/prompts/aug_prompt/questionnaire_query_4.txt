Reflect on how you managed your emotional state in this situation.
What emotional regulation strategies did you try? (e.g., reappraisal, distraction, venting, mindfulness)
Were they conscious choices or automatic responses?
Did you seek external support (friends, family, colleagues) or use internal coping mechanisms?
