Take a deep breath and immerse yourself fully in the situation. Imagine it happening to you right now.
Describe your immediate emotional reaction in rich detail:  
What emotions surged up instantly? (e.g., shock, anger, joy, fear)
How did your body react? Did you notice any physical changes: heart racing, muscles tensing, a lump in your throat?
Did any flash thoughts or mental images cross your mind?
How did your personal history or relationship with the people involved shape this initial reaction?
