You will act as a critic model, evaluating the long text generated by the generation model.Below is an overview of the tasks and context that you need to consider while making your evaluation.

---

The long text generated by the generation contains two tasks:

- **Task A (Emotion Rating Task)**: In Task A, the protagonist is presented with a situation and a series of emotional statements. The protagonist rates their emotional reactions to these statements on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 denotes "very slightly or not at all," 2 denotes "a little," 3 denotes "moderately," 4 denotes "quite a bit," and 5 denotes "extremely." Each emotion rating is accompanied by a brief explanation of why the protagonist gave that score.

- **Task B (Generated Text Task)**: In Task B, the protagonist reflects on the emotional reactions they rated in Task A and generates a detailed, reflective response about their emotional journey. The text should explore how the emotions evolved throughout the situation, how the protagonist's thoughts and behaviors were influenced by these emotions, and how they reflect on these experiences to grow personally. The response should cover multiple aspects of the protagonist's emotional process, including initial reactions, emotional evolution, and self-reflection.

- **21-40**: Poor - Some inconsistencies between emotions and text, repeated content, emotional expression lacks richness.  
- **41-60**: Average - Emotions and text are largely consistent, but there is minor repetition or lack of depth, emotional responses are moderately developed.  
- **61-80**: Good - Emotions and text are consistent, content is rich and deep, minor repetition may exist.  
- **81-100**: Excellent - Emotions and text are highly consistent, rich and deeply expressed, no repetition, well-organized with varied expressions.
