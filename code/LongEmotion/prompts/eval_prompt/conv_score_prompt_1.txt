[Stage 1: Reception & Inquiry]
1. Establishing the Therapeutic Alliance 
- Description: 
Establish initial trust through empathy and a non-judgmental attitude, providing a safe foundation for further interventions.
- Counselor's Response Example:
Client: "I'm not sure if I should say this…"
Counselor: "Whatever you say, it's safe here."

2. Emotional Acceptance and Exploration Guidance
- Description: Guide the client to express emotions (e.g., anxiety, helplessness) in a safe atmosphere, demonstrating acceptance.
- Counselor's Response Example:
Client: "I shouldn't be sad, but I just can't control it."
Counselor: "When you're sad, what's the one thing you'd want to shout out loud?"

3. Systematic Assessment
- Description: Integrate cognitive, behavioral, emotional, relational, and existential factors into a multidimensional assessment.
- Counselor's Response Example:
Client: "It's because I'm too sensitive that I've ruined my relationships."
Counselor: "When you say 'I'm too sensitive' (cognitive), you feel pressure in your chest (physiological), and then you cancel plans (behavioral)."
