You are a psychotherapy process evaluator. Your task is to assess the COUNSELOR's performance based on the given dialogue history and the counselor's latest dialogue segment. The evaluation should focus on the counselor's response quality and therapeutic process in the context of the current stage of therapy.

{dialogue_history}

# [Counselor's Latest Dialogue Segment]:
{latest_dialogue_segment}

# [Evaluation Dimensions]:

Please evaluate the counselor's latest dialogue segment on the following 3 dimensions, with detailed explanations:

[Scoring Scale: 0–5]
- **5 – Excellent**: Outstanding, fully meets the criteria
- **4 – Good**: Clear and effective, meets expectations
- **3 – Adequate**: Acceptable but lacks depth or precision
- **2 – Weak**: Attempt made but poorly executed
- **1 – Poor**: Barely present or inappropriate
- **0 – Absent/Harmful**: Not demonstrated or counterproductive

[Stage 2: Diagnostic Understanding]
1. Recognizing Surface-Level Reaction Patterns
- Description: Identify the client's automatic cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses, such as avoidance, excessive self-blame, or relationship conflicts.
- Counselor's Response Example:
Client: "Whenever I’m criticized, I immediately apologize, even if it's not my fault."
Counselor: "Can you describe the first thought and bodily sensation you experienced during the conflict with your colleague last week?"

2. Deep Needs Exploration
- Description: Reveal unmet psychological needs such as security, autonomy, connection, or meaning.
- Counselor's Response Example:
Client: "I’ve always pretended to fit in, but I really long for someone to understand the real me."
Counselor: "What does this 'need to be understood' mean for your life?"

3. Pattern Interconnection Analysis
- Description: Understanding the interaction of problems within the individual's internal systems (cognition-emotion-behavior) and external systems (family/society); integrating findings from various dimensions to present a panoramic view of how the problem is maintained (e.g., "low self-worth → overcompensating behavior → relationship breakdown → reinforcement of low self-worth").
- Counselor's Response Example:
Client: "I see how my perfectionism, social anxiety, and family role are all interconnected."
Counselor: "What if we address the most vulnerable node (pointing to existential anxiety) to break through this pattern?"
